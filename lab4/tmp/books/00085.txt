THE 

IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST 



FIRST ACT 



Scene — Morning-room in Algernon's Jiat in Half 
Moon Street. The room is luxuriously and artistic- 
ally furnished. The sound of a piano is lieard in the 
adjoining room. 

[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and 
after the music has ceased, Algernon enters.'] 

ALGERNON 

Did you hear what I was playing, Lane ? 

LANE 

I didn't think it polite to listen, sir. 

ALGERNON 

I'm sorry for that, for your sake. I don't play 
accurately — anyone can play accurately — but I play 
with wonderful expression. As far as the piano is 
concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science 
for Life. 

LANE 
Yes, sir. 



ALGERNON 

And, speaking of the science of Life, have you 
got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Brack- 
nell? 

LANE 
Yes, sir. \Hands them on a salver?^ 

ALGERNON 

\Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the 
so/a.] Oh ! ... by the way, Lane, I see from your 
book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman 
and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles 
of champagne are entered as having been consumed. 

LANE 
Yes, sir ; eight bottles and a pint. 

ALGERNON 

Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the 
servants invariably drink the champagne ? I ask 
merely for information. 

LANE 

I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, 
sir. I have often observed that in married house- 
holds the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand. 

ALGERNON 

Good Heavens ! Is marriage so demoralizing as 
that? 



LANE 



I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir. I have 
had very little experience of it myself up to the 
present. I have only been married once. That 
was in consequence of a misunderstanding between 
myself and a young person. 



ALGERNON 



{Languidly.'] I don't know that I am much in- 
terested in your family life, Lane. 



LANE 



No, sir ; it is not a very interesting subject. I 
never think of it myself. 

ALGERNON 

Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, 
thank you. 

LANE 

Thank you, sir. [Lane goes out.] 

ALGERNON 

Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax. 
Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good 
example, what on earth is the use of them ? They 
seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of 
moral responsibility. 



[Enter Lane.] 



LANE 

Mr. Ernest Worthing. 

{Enter Jack.l {Lane goes out.] 

ALGERNON 

How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings 
you up to town ? 

JACK 

Oh, pleasure, pleasure ! What else should bring 
one anywhere ? Eating as usual, I see, Algy ! 

ALGERNON 

[Sttj^j/.] I believe it is customary in good society 
to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock. 
Where have you been since last Thursday ? 

JACK 

[Sitting down on the sofa."] In the country. 

ALGERNON 

What on earth do you lio there ? 

JACK 

[Pulling off his gloves.] When one is in town one 
amuses oneself. When one is in the' country one 
amuses other people. It is excessively boring. 

4 



ALGERNON 

And who are the people you amuse ? 

JACK 

[Airily.'] Oh, neighbours, neighbours. 

ALGERNON 

Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire ? 

JACK 

Perfectly horrid ! Never speak to one of them. 

ALGERNON 

How immensely you must amuse them ! {^Goes 
over and takes sandwich.'] By the way, Shropshire 
is your county, is it not ? 

JACK 

Eh ? Shropshire ? Yes, of course. Hallo ! Why 

all these cups ? Why cucumber sandwiches ? Why 

such reckless extravagance in one so young ? Who 
is coming to tea ? 

ALGERNON 

Oh ! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen. 

JACK 

How perfectly delightful ! 



ALGERNON 

Yes, that is all very well ; but I am afraid Aunt 
Augusta won't quite approve of your being here. 

JACK 

May I ask why ? 

ALGERNON 

My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwen- 
dolen is perfectly disgraceful. It is almost as bad 
as the way Gwendolen flirts with you. 

JACK 

I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up 
to town expressly to propose to her. 

ALGERNON 

I thought you had come up for pleasure ? . . . I 
call that business. 

JACK 

How utterly unromantic you are ! 

ALGERNON 

I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. 
It is very romantic to be in love. But there is 
nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, 
one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. 
Then the excitement is all over. The very essence 

6 



of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, 
I'll certainly try to forget the fact. 

JACK 

I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The 
Divorce Court was specially invented for people 
whose memories are so curiously constituted. 

ALGERNON 

Oh ! there is no use speculating on that subject. 

Divorces are made in Heaven \^Jack puts out 

his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once 
interferes.'] Please don't touch the cucumber sand- 
wiches. They are ordered specially for Aunt Au- 
gusta. [ Takes one and eats it.] 

JACK 

Well, you have been eating them all the time. 

ALGERNON 

That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. 
[ Takes plate from below.] Have some bread and 
butter. The bread and butter is for Gwendolen. 
Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter. 

JACK 

[Advancing to table and helping himself] And 
very good bread and butter it is too. 

ALGERNON 

Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you 
7 



were going to eat it all. You behave as if you were 
married to her already. You are not married to 
her already, and I don't think you ever will be. 

JACK 

Why on earth do you say that ? 

ALGERNON 

Well, in the first place girls never marry the men 
they flirt with. Girls don't think it right. 

JACK 

Oh, that is nonsense ! 

ALGERNON 

It isn't. It is a great truth. It accounts for the 
extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all 
over the place. In the second place, I don't give 
my consent. 

JACK 

Your consent ! 

ALGERNON 

My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. 
And before I allow you to marry her, you will have 
to clear up the whole question of Cecily. [^Rings bell.'\ 

JACK 

Cecily ! What on earth do you mean ? What 



do you mean, Algy, by Cecily? I don't know 
anyone of the name of Cecily. 

[Enter Lane.] 
ALGERNON 

Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left 
in the smoking-room the last time he dined here. 

LANE 

Yes, sir. [Lane goes out.] 

JACK 

Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette 
case all this time? I wish to goodness you had let 
me know. I have been writing frantic letters to 
Scotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering 
a large reward. 

ALGERNON 

Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to 
be more than usually hard up. 

JACK 

There is no good offering a large reward now that 
the thing is found. 

[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. 
Algernon takes it at once. Lane goes out.] 

9 C 



ALGERNON 

I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I 
must say. \Opens case and examines if.] However, 
it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the 
inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours 
after all. 

JACK 

Of course it's mine. [Moving" to /mn.] You 
have seen me with it a hundred times, and you 
have no right whatsoever to read what is written 
inside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a 
private cigarette case. 

ALGERNON 

Oh ! it is absurd to have a hard-and-fast rule 
about what one should read and what one shouldn't. 
More than half of modern culture depends on what 
one shouldn't read. 

JACK 

I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose 
to discuss modern culture. It isn't the sort of thing 
one should talk of in private. I simply want my 
cigarette case back. 

ALGERNON 

Yes ; but this isn't your cigarette case. This 
cigarette case is a present from someone of the 
name of Cecily, and you said you didn't know any- 
one of that name. 

lo 



JACK 

Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be 
my aunt. 

ALGERNON 

Your aunt ! 

JACK 

Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at 
Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy. 

ALGERNON 

[^Retreating to back of so/a.] But why does she 
call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives 
at Tunbridge Wells ? [Reading.] " From little 
Cecily with her fondest love." 

JACK 

[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear 
fellow, what on earth is there in that ? Some aunts 
are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter 
that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for 
herself You seem to think that every aunt should 
be exactly like your aunt ! That is absurd ! For 
Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case. 
[Follows Ernest round the room.] 

ALGERNON 

Yes. But why does your aunt call you her 
uncle ? '• From little Cecily, with her fondest love 

II 



to her dear Uncle Jack." There is no objection, I 
admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an 
aunt, no matter what her size may be, should 
call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make 
out. Besides, your name isn't Jack at all ; it is 
Ernest. 

JACK 

It isn't Ernest ; it 's Jack. 

ALGERNON 

You have always told me it was Ernest. I have 
introduced you to everyone as Ernest. You answer 
to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name 
was Ernest. You are the most earnest looking 
person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd 
your saying that your name isn't Ernest. It 's on 
your cards. Here is one of them. \_Taking it from 
case.] " Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany." 
I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest 
if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwen- 
dolen, or to anyone else. [Puts the card in his 
pocket i\ 

JACK 

Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in 
the country, and the cigarette case was given to 
me in the country. 

ALGERNON 

Yes, but that does not account for the fact that 
12 



your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge 
Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come, old boy, 
you had much better have the thing out at once. 

JACK 

My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a 
dentist. It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist 
when one isn't a dentist. It produces a false 
impression. 

ALGERNON 

Well, that is exactly what dentists always do. 
Now, go on ! Tell me the whole thing. I may 
mention that I have always suspected you of being 
a confirmed and secret Bunburyist ; and I am quite 
sure of it now.  

JACK 

Bunburyist ? What on earth do you mean by a 

Bunburyist ? 

ALGERNON 

I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incompar- 
able expression as soon as you are kind enough to 
inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack 
in the country. 

JACK 

Well, produce my cigarette case first. 
13 



ALGERNON 

Here it is. {Hands cigarette case.] Now produce 
your explanation, and pray make it improbable. 
[St'ts on sofa.] 

JACK 

My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable 
about my explanation at all. In fact it 's perfectly 
ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted 
me when I was a little boy, made me in his will 
guardian to his grand-daughter. Miss Cecily Cardew. 
Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives 
of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, 
lives at my place in the country under the charge 
of her admirable governess. Miss Prism. 

ALGERNON 

Where is that place in the country, by the way ? 

JACK 

That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not 
going to be invited. ... I may tell you candidly 
that the place is not in Shropshire. 

ALGERNON 

I suspected that, my dear fellow ! I have Bun- 
buryed all over Shropshire on two separate occa- 
sions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town 
and Jack in the country? 

H 



JACK 

My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will 
be able to understand my real motives. You are 
hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the 
position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high 
moral tone on all subjects. It 's one's duty to do 
so. And as a high moral tone can hardly be said 
to conduce very much to either one's health or one's 
happiness, in order to get up to town I have always 
pretended to have a younger brother of the name 
of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into 
the most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, 
is the whole truth pure and simple. 

ALGERNON 

The truth is rarely pure and never simple. 
Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, 
and modern literature a complete impossibility ! 

JACK 

That wouldn't be at all a bad thing. 

ALGERNON 

Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear 
fellow. Don't try it. You should leave that to 
people who haven't been at a University. They do 
it so well in the daily papers. What you really 
are is a Bunburyist. I was quite right in saying 
you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most 
advanced Bunburyists I know. 

15 



JACK 

What an earth do you mean ? 

ALGERNON 

You have invented a very useful younger brother 
called Ernest, in order that you may be able to 
come up to town as often as you like. I have 
invented an invaluable permanent invalid called 
Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down 
into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is 
perfectly invaluable. If it wasn't for Bunbury's 
extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn't 
be able to dine with you at Willis's to-night, for I 
have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for 
more than a week. 

JACK 

I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere 
to-night.^ 

ALGERNON 

I know. You are absurdly careless about send- 
ing out invitations. It is very foolish of you. 
Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving 
invitations. 

JACK 

You had much better dine with your Aunt 
Augusta. 

i6 



ALGERNON 

I haven't the smallest intention of doing any- 
thing of the kind. To begin with, I dined there 
on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to 
dine with one's own relations. In the second place, 
whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a 
member of the family, and sent down with either 
no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I 
know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, 
to-night. She will place me next Mary Farquhar, 
who always flirts with her own husband across the 
dinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, 
it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is 
enormously on the increase. The amount of women 
in London who flirt with their own husbands is 
perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is sim- 
ply washing one's clean linen in public. Besides, 
now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist 
I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. 
I want to tell you the rules. 

JACK 

I'm not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen 
accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed 
I think I'll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little 
too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. 
So I am going to get rid of Ernest. And I strongly 
advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your 
invalid friend who has the absurd name. 

ALGERNON 

Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and 
17 D 



if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely 
problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury. 
A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has 
a very tedious time of it. 

JACK 

That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl 
like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw 
in my life that I would marry, I certainly won't want 
to know Bunbury. 

ALGERNON 

Then your wife will. You don't seem to realize, 
that in married life three is company and two is 
none. 

JACK 

\_Senfentiously.'\ That, my dear young friend, is 
the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been 
propounding for the last fifty years. 

ALGERNON 

Yes ; and that the happy English home has proved 
in half the time. 

JACK 

For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical. It's 
perfectly easy to be cynical. 

i8 



ALGERNON 

My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything now- 
a-days. There's such a lot of beastly competition 
about. [ The sound of an electric bell is heard.'] Ah ! 
that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or 
creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner. 
Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so 
that you can have an opportunity for proposing to 
Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis's? 

JACK 

I suppose so, if you want to. 

ALGERNON 

Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate 
people who are not serious about meals. It is so 
shallow of them. 

{Enter Lane.] 

LANE 

Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax. 
\^A Igernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady 
Bracknell and Gwendolen^ 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are 
behaving very well. 

ALGERNON 

I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta. 
19 



LADY BRACKNELL 

That's not quite the same thing. In fact the two 
things rarely go together. [Sees Jack and bows to 
him with icy coldness^ 

ALGERNON 

[ To Gwendolen^ Dear me, you are smart ! 

GWENDOLEN 

I am always smart ! Aren't I, Mr. Worthing? 

JACK 

You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax. 

GWENDOLEN 

Oh ! I hope I am not that. It would leave no 
room for developments, and I intend to develop 
in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down 
together in the corner^ 

LADY BRACKNELL 

I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I 
was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury. I hadn't 
been there since her poor husband's death. I never 
saw a woman so altered ; she looks quite twenty 
years younger. And now I'll have a cup of tea, 
and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you 
promised me. 



ALGERNON 

Certainly, Aunt Augusta. [ Goes over to tea-tahle!\ 

LADY BRACKNELL 
Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen ? 

GWENDOLEN 

Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I 
am. 

ALGERNON 

\Picki7igup empty plate in horror.'] Good heavens ! 
Lane ! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches ? 
I ordered them specially. 

LANE 

[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the 
market this morning, sir. I went down twice. 

ALGERNON 

No cucumbers ! 

LANE 

No, sir. Not even for ready money. 

ALGERNON 

That will do. Lane, thank you. 

21 



LANE 

Thank you, sir. [Goes out.'] 

ALGERNON 

I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about 
there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

It really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some 
crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to 
be living entirely for pleasure now. 

ALGERNON 

I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

It certainly has changed its colour. From what 
cause I, of course, cannot say. [A/gernon crosses 
and hands tea.] Thank you. I've quite a treat for 
you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you 
down with Mary Farquhar. She is such a nice 
woman, and so attentive to her husband. It 's de- 
lightful to watch them. 

ALGERNON 

I am afraid. Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give 
up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after 
all. 

22 



LADY BRACKNELL 



{^Frowning.'] I hope not, Algernon. It would put 
my table completely out. Your uncle would have 
to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to 
that. 



ALGERNON 



It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a ter- 
rible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have 
just had a telegram to say that my poor friend 
Bunbury is very ill again. \ExcJianges glances with 
Jack?[ They seem to think I should be with him. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

It is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to 
suffer from curiously bad health. 

ALGERNON 

Yes ; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is 
high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind 
whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly- 
shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any 
way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. 
I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly 
a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the 
primary duty of life. I am always telling that to 
your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much 
notice ... as far as any improvement in his ailments 

23 



goes. I should be much obliged if you would ask 
Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to 
have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to 
arrange my music for me. It is my last reception, 
and one wants something that will encourage con- 
versation, particularly at the end of the season when 
everyone has practically said whatever they had to 
say, which, in most cases, was probably not much. 

ALGERNON 

I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still 
conscious, and I think I can promise you he'll be all 
right by Saturday. Of course the music is a great 
difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people 
don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't 
talk. But I'll run over the programme I've drawn 
out, if you will kindly come into the next room for 
a moment. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of 
you. \Rising, and following Algernon^ I'm sure the 
programme will be delightful, after a few expurga- 
tions. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People 
always seem to think that they are improper, and 
either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, 
which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly 
respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. 
Gwendolen, you will accompany me. 



GWENDOLEN 

Certainly, mamma. 



24 



\^Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music- 
rootn, Gwendolen remains behind."] 

JACK 

Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax. 

GWENDOLEN 

Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. 
Worthing. Whenever people talk to me about the 
weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean 
something else. And that makes me so nervous. 

JACK 

I do mean something else. 

GWENDOLEN 

I thought so. In fact, I am never wrong. 

JACK 

And I would like to be allowed to take advantage 
of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence . . . 

GWENDOLEN 

I would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma 
has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that 
I have often had to speak to her about. 

JACK 

[Nervously.'] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you 
I have admired you more than any girl ... I have 
ever met since ... I met you. 

25 E 



GWENDOLEN 

Yes, I am quite aware of the fact. And I often 
wish that in pubHc, at any rate, you had been more 
demonstrative. For me you have always had an 
irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I 
was far from indifferent to you. {Jack looks at her 
in amazement^ We live, as I hope you know, Mr. 
Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is constantly 
mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, 
and has reached the provincial pulpits I am told: 
and my ideal has always been to love some one of 
the name of Ernest. There is something in that 
name that inspires absolute confidence. The moment 
Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend 
called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you. 

JACK 

You really love me, Gwendolen ? 

GWENDOLEN 
Passionately ! 

JACK 

Darling! You don't know how happy you've 
made me. 

GWENDOLEN 
My own Ernest ! 

JACK 

But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't 
love me if my name wasn't Ernest ? 

26 



GWENDOLEN 

But your name is Ernest. 

JACK 

Yes, I know it is. But supposing it was something 
else ? Do you mean to say you couldn't love me 
then? 

GWENDOLEN 

[Glibly.'] Ah ! that is clearly a metaphysical 
speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations 
has very little reference at all to the actual facts of 
real life, as we know them. 

JACK 

Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I 
don't much care about the name of Ernest ... I 
don't think the name suits me at all. 

GWENDOLEN 

It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It 
has a music of its own. It produces vibrations. 

JACK 

Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think 
there are lots of other much nicer names, I think 
Jack, for instance, a charming name. 

27 



GWENDOLEN 

Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name 
Jack, if any at all, indeed. It does not thrill. It 
produces absolutely no vibrations. ... I have known 
several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were 
more than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious 
domesticity for John ! And I pity any woman who 
is married to a man called John. She would probably 
never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of 
a single moment's solitude. The only really safe 
name is Ernest. 

JACK 

Gwendolen, I must get christened at once — I 
mean we must get married at once. There is no 
time to be lost. 

GWENDOLEN 

Married, Mr. Worthing ? 

JACK 

{Astounded.'] Well . . . surely. You know that I 
love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, 
that you were not absolutely indifferent to me. 

GWENDOLEN 

I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me 
yet. Nothing has been said at all about marriage. 
The subject has not even been touched on. 

28 



JACK 

Well . . . may I propose to you now ? 
GWENDOLEN 

I think it would be an admirable opportunity. 
And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. 
Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite 
frankly beforehand that I am fully determined to 
accept you. 

JACK 

Gwendolen ! 

GWENDOLEN 

Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say 

to me? 

JACK 

You know what I have got to say to you. 

GWENDOLEN 

Yes, but you don't say it. 

JACK 

Gwendolen, will you marry me? {Goes on his knees.] 

GWENDOLEN 

Of course I will, darling. How long you have 
been about it ! I am afraid you have had very little 
experience in how to propose. 

29 



JACK 

My own one, I have never loved anyone in the 
world but you. 

GWENDOLEN 

Yes, but men often propose for practice. I know 
my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell me 
so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest ! 
They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always 
look at me just like that, especially when there are 
other people present. 

[Enter Lady Bracknell?^ 
LADY BRACKNELL 

Mr. Worthing ! Rise, sir, from this semi-re- 
cumbent posture. It is most indecorous. 

GWENDOLEN 

Mamma ! \He tries to rise ; she restrains hiin.l 
I must beg you to retire. This is no place for you. 
Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Finished what, may I ask ? 

GWENDOLEN 

I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They 
rise together!] 

30 



LADY BRACKNELL • 

Pardon me, you are not engaged to anyone. 
When you do become engaged to some one, I, or 
your father, should his health permit him, will in- 
form you of the fact. An engagement should come 
on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, 
as the case may be. It is hardly a matter that she 
could be allowed to arrange for herself. . . . And 
now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. 
Worthing. While I am making these inquiries, 
you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the 
carriage. 

GWENDOLEN 

{Reproachfully ?\^ Mamma ! 

LADY BRACKNELL 

In the carriage, Gwendolen ! {Gwendolen goes to 
the door. She and Jack blow kisses to each other 
behind Lady Bracknell's back. Lady Bracknell looks 
vaguely about as if she could not understand what 
tJie noise was. Finally turns roundi\ Gwendolen, 
the carriage ! 

GWENDOLEN 

Yes, mamma. {Goes out, looking back at Jacki\ 

LADY BRACKNELL 

{Sitting down?^ You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing. 
{Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil?^ 
31 



JAGK 

Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

[^Pencil and note-book in hand.'] I feel bound to 
tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible 
young men, although I have the same list as the 
dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in 
fact. However, I am quite ready to enter your 
name, should your answers be what a really affec- 
tionate mother requires. Do you smoke ? 

JACK 

Well, yes, I must admit I smoke. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

I am glad to hear it. A man should always have 
an occupation of some kind. There are far too 
many idle men in London as it is. How old are 
you? 

JACK 

Twenty-nine. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

A very good age to be married at. I have always 
been of opinion that a man who desires to get 
married should know either everything or nothing. 
Which do you know ? 

32 



JACK 

[After some hesitation.'] I know nothing, Lady 
Bracknell. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

I am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of 
anything that tampers with natural ignorance. 
Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit ; touch it 
and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern 
education is radically unsound. Fortunately in 
England, at any rate, education produces no effect 
whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious 
danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to 
acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. What is your 
income ? 

JACK 

Between seven and eight thousand a year. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

[Makes a note in her dook.] In land, or in invest- 
ments ? 

JACK 

In investments, chiefly. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

That is satisfactory. What between the duties 
expected of one during one's lifetime, and the duties 
exacted from one after one's death, land has ceased 

33 F 



to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one 
position, and prevents one from keeping it up. 
That 's all that can be said about land. 

JACK 

I have a country house with some land, of course, 
attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe ; 
but I don't depend on that for my real income. In 
fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the 
only people who make anything out of it. . 

LADY BRACKNELL 

A country house ! How many bedrooms? Well, 
that point can be cleared up afterwards. You have 
a town house, I hope ? A girl with a simple, un- 
spoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be 
expected to reside in the country. 

JACK 

Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is 
let by the year to Lady Bloxham. Of course, I can 
get it back whenever I like, at six months' notice. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Lady Bloxham ? I don't know her. 

JACK 

Oh, she goes about very little. She is a lady 
considerably advanced in years. 

34 



LADY BRACKNELL 

Ah, now-a-days that is no guarantee of respect- 
ability of character. What number in Belgrave 
Square ? 

JACK 

149. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

{^Shaking her head.l The unfashionable side. I 
thought there was something. However, that could 
easily be altered. 

JACK 

Do you mean the fashion, or the side ? 

LADY BRACKNELL 

[Sternly.'] Both, if necessary, I presume. What 
are your politics ? 

JACK 

Well, I am afraid I really have none. I am a 
Liberal Unionist. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Oh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or 
come in the evening, at any rate. Now to minor 
matters. Are your parents living ? 

35 



JACK 

I have lost both my parents. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Both ? . , . That seems like carelessness. Who 
was your father ? He was evidently a man of some 
wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers 
call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from 
the ranks of the aristocracy ? 

JACK 

I am afraid I really don't know. The fact is, 
Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents. It 
would be nearer the truth to say that my parents 
seem to have lost me ... I don't actually know who 
I am by birth. I was . . . well, I was found. 

LADY BRACKNELL 
Found ! 

JACK 

The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman 
of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found 
me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he 
happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing 
in his pocket at the time. Worthing is a place in 
Sussex. It is a seaside resort. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

Where did the charitable gentleman who had a 
first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you ? 

36 



JACK 

[Gravefy.] In a hand-bag. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

A hand-bag ? 

JACK 

[ Very seriously.'] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in 
a hand-bag — a somewhat large, black leather hand- 
bag, with handles to it — an ordinary hand-bag in 
fact. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, 
Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag ? 

JACK 

In the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was 
given to him in mistake for his own. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

The cloak-room at Victoria Station ? 

JACK 

Yes. The Brighton line. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

The line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess 
I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just 

37 



told me. To be born, or at any rate bred, in a 
hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to 
me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies 
of family life that remind one of the worst excesses 
of the French Revolution. And I presume you 
know what that unfortunate movement led to ? As 
for the particular locality in which the hand-bag 
was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might 
serve to conceal a social indiscretion — has probably, 
indeed, been used for that purpose before now — but 
it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for 
a recognized position in good society. 

JACK 

May I ask you then what you would advise me 
to do ? I need hardly say I would do anything in 
the world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness. 

LADY BRACKNELL 

I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try 
and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and 
to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one 
parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over. 

JACK 

Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to 
do that. I can produce the hand-bag at any moment. 
It is in my dressing-room at home. I really think 
that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell. 

38 



LADY BRACKNELL 

Me, sir ! What has it to do with me ? You can 
hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would 
dream of allowing our only daughter — a girl brought 
up with the utmost care — to marryinto a cloak-room, 
and form an alliance with a parcel ? Good morning, 
Mr. Worthing ! 

\Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation?^ 

JACK 

Good morning ! {Algernon, from tJie other room, 
strikes up the Wedding March. Jack looks perfectly 
furious, and goes to the door.^ For goodness' sake 
don't play that ghastly tune, Algy! How idiotic 



you are 



[The music stops, and Algernon enters cheerily. '\ 

ALGERNON 

Didn't it go off all right, old boy? You don't 
mean to say Gwendolen refused you ? I know it is 
a way she has. She is always refusing people. I 
think it is most ill-natured of her. 

JACK 

Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as 
she is concerned, we are engaged. Her mother is 
perfectly unbearable. Never met such a Gorgon . . . 
I don't really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am 
quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, 
she is a monster, without being a myth, which is 

39 



rather unfair ... I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose 
I shouldn't talk about your own aunt in that way 
before you. 

ALGERNON 

My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. 
It is the only thing that makes me put up with them 
at all. Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, 
who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to 
live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die. 

JACK 

Oh, that is nonsense ! 

ALGERNON 

It isn't ! 

JACK 

Well, I won't argue about the matter. You 
always want to argue about things. 

ALGERNON 

That is exactly what things were originally made 
for. 

JACK 

Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot 
myself . . . [A pause.] You don't think there is any 
chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother in 
about a hundred and fifty years, do you Algy ? 

40 



ALGERNON 

All women become like their mothers. That is 
their tragedy. No man does. That 's his. 

JACK 

Is that clever ? 

ALGERNON 

It is perfectly phrased ! and quite as true as any 
observation in civilized life should be. 

JACK 

I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is 
clever now-a-days. You can't go anywhere without 
meeting clever people. The thing has become an 
absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we 
had a few fools left. 

ALGERNON 

We have. 

JACK 

I should extremely like to meet them. What do 
they talk about ? 

ALGERNON 

The fools ? Oh ! about the clever people, of course. 

JACK 

What fools ! 

41 G 



ALGERNON 

By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth 
about your being Ernest in town, and Jack in the 
country ? 

JACK 

[In a very patronising manner^ My dear fellow, 
the truth isn't quite the sort of thing one tells to a 
nice sweet refined girl. What extraordinary ideas 
you have about the way to behave to a woman ! 

ALGERNON 

The only way to behave to a woman is to make 
love to her, if she is pretty, and to someone else if 
she is plain. 

JACK 

Oh, that is nonsense. 

ALGERNON 

What about your brother? What about the 
profligate Ernest? 

JACK 

Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got 
rid of him, I'll say he died in Paris of apoplexy. 
Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, 
don't they? 

42 



ALGERNON 

Yes, but it 's hereditary, my dear fellow. It 's a 
sort of thing that runs in families. You had much 
better say a severe chill. 

JACK 

You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or 
anything of that kind ? 

ALGERNON 

Of course it isn't ! 

JACK 

Very well, then. My poor brother Ernest is 
carried off suddenly in Paris, by a severe chill. 
That gets rid of him. 

ALGERNON 

But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew 
was a little too much interested in your poor brother 
Ernest ? Won't she feel his loss a good deal ? 

JACK 

Oh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic 
girl, I am glad to say. She has got a capital appetite, 
goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her 
lessons. 

ALGERNON 

I would rather like to see Cecily. 
43 



JACK 

I will take very good care you never do. She is 
excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen. 

ALGERNON 

Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an 
excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen ? 

JACK 

Oh ! one doesn't blurt these things out to people. 
Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be 
extremely great friends. I'll bet you anything you 
like that half an hour after they have met, they will 
be calling each other sister. 

ALGERNON 

Women only do that when they have called each 
other a lot of other things first. Now, my dear boy, 
if we want to get a good table at Willis's, we really 
must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven ? 

JACK 

[^Irritably. ^ Oh ! it always is nearly seven 

ALGERNON 

Well, I'm hungry. 

44 



JACK 

I never knew you when you weren't. . . . 

ALGERNON 

What shall we do after dinner ? Go to a theatre ? 

JACK 

Oh no ! I loathe listening. 

ALGERNON 

Well, let us go to the Club ? 

JACK 

Oh, no ! I hate talking. 

ALGERNON 

Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten ? 

JACK 

Oh no ! I can't bear looking at things. It is so 
silly. 

ALGERNON 

Well, what shall we do ? 

JACK 

Nothing ! 

45 



ALGERNON 

It is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, 
I don't mind hard work where there is no definite 
object of any kind. 

[Enter Lane.] 

LANE 

Miss Fairfax. 

[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.] 

ALGERNON 

Gwendolen, upon my word ! 

GWENDOLEN 

Algy, kindly turn your back. I have something 
very particular to say to Mr. Worthing. 

ALGERNON 

Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this 
at all. 

GWENDOLEN 

Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude 
towards life. You are not quite old enough to do 
that. [Algernon retires to the fireplace.] 

JACK 

My own darling ! 

46 



GWENDOLEN 

Ernest, we may never be married. From the 
expression on mamma's face I fear we never shall. 
Few parents now-a-days pay any regard to what 
their children say to them. The old-fashioned 
respect for the young is fast dying out. Whatever 
influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age 
of three. But although she may prevent us from 
becoming man and wife, and I may marry someone 
else, and marry often, nothing that she can possibly 
do can alter my eternal devotion to you. . 

JACK 

Dear Gwendolen ! 

GWENDOLEN 

The story of your romantic origin, as related to 
me by mamma, with unpleasing comments, has 
naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature. 
Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. 
The simplicity of your character makes you ex- 
quisitely incomprehensible to me. Your town ad- 
dress at the Albany I have. What is your address 
in the country ? 

JACK 

The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire. 

[A/g-ernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles 
to hi7nself, and writes the address on his shirt-cuff. 
Then picks up the Railway Guide\ 

47 



GWENDOLEN 

There is a good postal service, I suppose? It 
may be necessary to do something desperate. That 
of course will require serious consideration. I will 
communicate with you daily. 

JACK 

My own one ! 

GWENDOLEN 

How long do you remain in town ? 

JACK 

Till Monday. 

GWENDOLEN 

Good ! Algy, you may turn round now. 

ALGERNON 

Thanks, I've turned round already. 
GWENDOLEN 

You may also ring the bell. 

JACK 

You will let me see you to your carriage, my 
own darling? 

GWENDOLEN 

Certainly. 

48 



JACK 

[ To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax 
out. 

LANE 

Yes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.] 

\Lane presents several letters on asalver to Algernon. 
It is to be surmised that they are bills, as Algernon 
after looking at the envelopes, tears them up.] 

ALGERNON 

A glass of sherry, Lane. 

LANE 
Yes, sir. 

ALGERNON 

To-morrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying. 

LANE 
Yes, sir. 

ALGERNON 

I shall probably not be back till Monday. You 
can put up my dress clothes, my smoking jacket, 
and all the Bunbury suits . . . 

49 H 



LANE 

Yes, sir. \Handing sherry^ 

ALGERNON 

I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane. 

LANE 

It never is, sir. 

ALGERNON 

Lane, you're a perfect pessimist. 

LANE 

I do my best to give satisfaction, sir. 
\Enter Jack. Lane goes off."] 

JACK 

There 's a sensible, intellectual girl ! the only girl I 
ever cared for in my life. [A/gernou is laughing 
immoderately ?\^ What on earth are you so amused at ? 

ALGERNON 

Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that 
is all. 

JACK 

If )^ou don't take care, your friend Bunbury will 
get you into a serious scrape some day. 

50 



ALGERNON 

I love scrapes. They are the only things that are 
never serious. 

JACK 

Oh, that 's nonsense, Algy. You never talk any- 
thing but nonsense. 

ALGERNON 

Nobody ever does. 

\Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the 
room. Algernon lights a cigarette, reads his shirt- 
cuff, aud smiles. ] 



Act-drop. 



51 



SECOND ACT 



Scene — Garden at the Manor House. A flight 
of gray stone steps leads up to the house. The 
garden^ an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of 
year, fuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with 
books, are set under a large yew tree. 

[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily 
is at the back watering flowers^ 

MISS PRISM 

{Calling?^ Cecily, Cecily ! Surely such a utili- 
tarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather 
Moulton's duty than yours ? Especially at a moment 
when intellectual pleasures await you. Your Ger- 
man grammar is on the table. Pray open it at page 
fifteen. We will repeat yesterday's lesson, 

CECILY 

[Coming over very slowly ."] But I don't like German. 
It isn't at all a becoming language. I know per- 
fectly well that I look quite plain after my German 
lesson. 

55 



MISS PRISM 

Child, you know how anxious your guardian is 
that you should improve yourself in every way. 
He laid particular stress on your German, as he 
was leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always 
lays stress on your German when he is leaving for 
town. 

CECILY 

Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious ! Sometimes 
he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite 
well. 

MISS PRISM 

[Drawing herself up. "] Your guardian enjoys the 
best of health, and his gravity of demeanour is 
especially to be commended in one so comparatively 
young as he is. I know no one who has a higher 
sense of duty and responsibility. 

CECILY 

I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored 
when we three are together. 

MISS PRISM 

Cecily ! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing 
has many troubles in his life. Idle merriment and 
triviality would be out of place in his conversation. 
You must remember his constant anxiety about 
that unfortunate young man his brother. 

56 



^ 



CECILY 

I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate 
young man, his brother, to come down here some- 
times. We might have a good influence over him, 
Miss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You 
know German, and geology, and things of that kind 
influence a man very much. \Cecily begins to write 
in her diary. "l 

MISS PRISM 

\^Skaking her headJ] I do not think that even I 
could produce any effect on a character that ac- 
cording to his own brother's admission is irretriev- 
ably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure 
that I would desire to reclaim him. I am not in 
favour of this modern mania for turning bad people 
into good people at a moment's notice. As a man 
sows so let him reap. You must put away your 
diary, Cecily. I really don't see why you should 
keep a diary at all. 

CECILY 

I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful 
secrets of my life. If I didn't write them down I 
should probably forget all about them. 

MISS PRISM 

Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all 
carry about with us. 

CECILY 

Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have 
57 I 



never happened, and couldn't possibly have hap- 
pened. I believe that Memory is responsible for 
nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie 
sends us. 



MISS PRISM 



Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume 
novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days. 



CECILY 

Did you really. Miss Prism ? How wonderfully 
clever you are ! I hope it did not end happily ? I 
don't like novels that end happily. They depress 
me so much. 

MISS PRISM 

The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. 
That is what Fiction means. 

CECILY 

I suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And 
was your novel ever published ? 

MISS PRISM 

Alas ! no. The manuscript unfortunately was 
abandoned. I use the word in the sense of lost or 
mislaid. To your work, child, these speculations 
are profitless. 

CECILY 

{Smiling.'] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming 
up through the garden. 

58 



MISS PRISM 

{^Rising and advancing?^ Dr. Chasuble ! This is 
indeed a pleasure. 

[Enter Canon Chasuble.'] 
CHASUBLE 

And how are we this morning ? Miss Prism, you 
are, I trust, well ? 

CECILY 

Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight 
headache. I think it would do her so much good 
to have a short stroll with you in the Park, Dr. 
Chasuble. 

MISS PRISM 

Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a 
headache. 

CECILY 

No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt in- 
stinctively that you had a headache. Indeed I was 
thinking about that, and not about my German 
lesson, when the Rector came in. 

CHASUBLE 

I hope Cecily, you are not inattentive. 

CECILY 

Oh, I am afraid I am. 

59 



CHASUBLE 

That is strange. Were I fortunate e
