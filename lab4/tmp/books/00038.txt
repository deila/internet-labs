CONVERSATIONAL JAPANESE 
FOR BEGINNERS. 



INTRODUCTION. 

This book consists of three parts : Part I, Graduated Exercises in Conversa- 
tional Japanese ; Part II, Elementary Grammar of the Japanese Spoken 
Language ; Part III, Vocabulary of Common Japanese Words.* 

The learning of a language is a complicated process. In general it may be 
said to consist of two parts, theory and practice. Theory refers to the know- 
ledge of words, their peculiarities, special uses, inflexions, how they depend on 
each other and how they are combined in a sentence. Elementary notions on 
these subjects as regards Colloquial Japanese will be found in Parts II and III 
of this work. Practice consists in learning to express oneself without difficulty 
or hesitation, in acquiring a correct pronunciation and in training the ear to 
understand the language as spoken by the natives. Practice, of course, cannot 
be learned from books ; however, the Exercises in Part I, supply models and 
materials for a great number of sentences which can be used in real life. 

The student is strongly advised to speak Japanese or try to speak Japanese 
on every possible occasion : to servants, rikisha-men, tramway-conductors, 
shop-attendants, etc.; and to continue speaking Japanese even when the other 
person answers in quite good English. Get as much practice in Japanese as you 
can, and don't go about giving free lessons in English. 

The author suggests that the student should begin with the Exercises, 
studying only such parts of the Grammar as are indicated at the beginning of 
each Exercise and consulting the Vocabulary when necessary. No particular 
method of study is recommended in detail ; but the author believes that the 
pupil should repeat each sentence after his teacher several times until he can 
say it with a fairly good pronounciation and a reasonable degree of fluency ; he 
should also have a knowledge of what the sentence means while he is saying it ; 
the lesson should not be considered as known until he can do all the above with 
his book closed. 

By the time the student has finished the Exercises, he will have gone all 
through the Grammar, and he should then, if he has the courage, read the Vo- 
cabulary, which contains many useful phrases not found in the Exercises, and 
many hints regarding the use of common words, which frequently are a source 
of trouble to the beginner. 

The Japanese Exercises were made in Japanese by a Japanese under the 
author's direction ; they are in no sense a translation of the English ; on the 
contrary, the English is a translation of the Japanese. It should be clearly 
understood that the version given is only one out of many equally good and 
correct translations which might be given. This will be readily understood 
when it is remembered, that in Japanese nouns have neither gender, number 

* For the convenience of those who wish to read the Japanese Characters from the 
very beginning of their studies, the Japanese text of Part I has been printed apart in 
Japanese Characters with kana alongside : this is called Part IV.

nor case, and verbs have of ten no subject expressed nor have they any inflexions 
corresponding to person or number ; in real life, the meaning is determined by 
context and circumstances. 

In the Vocabulary at the end of this book the etymology of words is given 
when it is considered helpful to the student. The average educated Japanese 
has no notion of what etymology means ; and when asked the origin of a word 
will immediately start explaining the characters or symbols with which it is 
written. .In this matter the author's chief guide has been Otsuki's Genkai. 

Besides the present book, the student who wishes, not only to go through 
these Exercises, but to express his own ideas, must have an English-Japanese 
Dictionary : the best one no doubt is, Hobart-Hampden and Parlett's English- 
Japanese Dictionary of the Spoken Language ; if a pocket dictionary is desired, 
the author's English- Japanese Conversation Dictionary may prove useful. 
Japanese-English dictionaries are very numerous but mostly unsatisfactory as 
they are generally made for the use of the Japanese ; the best one is perhaps 
Brinkley 's. 

The author begs also to recommend the following : Lange 's A Text-book of 
Colloquial Japanese, for exercises of a more advanced type ; Chamberlain 's 
Handbook of Colloquial Japanese, for further studies of the grammar ; Imbrie 's 
Handbook of English- Japanese Etymology, for the translation of those words in 
English which are of special difficulty. These books the author has consulted 
throughout and used freely. 

The author's Examples of Conversational Japanese, Parts I and II may be 
useful to the student who has made some progress in the present book. Part 
II uses no word not contained in this work, Part I has a somewhat more exten- 
sive vocabulary but an English translation is given along with the Japanese 
text. Part III of this work is the Japanese text of Parts I and II in Japanese 
characters with kana alongside. 

Those who wish to obtain some knowledge of the written characters cannot 
do better than study Chamberlain's The Study of Japanese Writing ; a cheap 
extract on the same subject is the author's Three Thousand Chinese- J apanese 
Characters. 

The letter A, B, C or D found after each sentence gives an idea of the 
degree of politeness : ' A ' sentences should be used to inferiors only ; ' B ' are 
familiar ; ' C ' are polite in an ordinary way ; and ' D ' are somewhat formally 
polite. 

Black-face numbers refer to the paragraphs of Part II, 



PART I. 

GRADUATED EXERCISES 

IN 
CONVERSATIONAL JAPANESE. 



EXERCISE 1. 

Japanese nouns have no number and, as a rule, no gender. 

Adjectives in Japanese, as in English, have no gender or number. Japanese 
verbs have no person or number. 

True adjectives in Japanese end in ai, ii, oi or ui. Used attributively the 
adjective is placed, as in English, before the noun. When used as predicates of 
affirmative sentences in familiar speech there is no need of any verb in Japanese ; 
in less familiar speech no desu or simply desu is added. 

The negative construction of adjectives is shown in 195; nai is familiar and 
must be replaced by arimasen in polite speech. 

Particles or postpositions are placed after the word to which they refer. 

empitsu : a pencil. chiisai : small. 

mise : a shop ; an office. kuroi : black. 

uchi : a house. desu : am ; is ; are. 

kono : this. arimasen ; nai (familiar) : is not. 

sono : that (not far). wa : a particle used for emphasis or 

ano : that (far). contrast, often placed after the subject

EXERCISE 3, 

Certain nouns followed by the particle na or no have the force of adjectives, 
and are called quasi-adjectives. 

When used predicatively de takes the place of na (or no) and is followed by 
aru, arimasu or gozaimasu according to the degree of politeness. Note that 
de aru is generally abbreviated to da, and de arimasu to desu. 

In the negative na (or no) is changed to de wa (often abbreviated to ja). 

Some true adjectives may be used attributively as quasi-adjectives in na after 
supressing the final i of the adjective. Thus okii uchi or oki na uchi a big house ; 
chiisai mise or chiisa na mise a small shop. 

kin (noun) ; kin no (adj.) : gold. na : a particle used for forming quasi- 

baka : a fool. adjectives. 

baka na : foolish ; silly. no : a particle used for forming quasi- 

benri na : convenient. adjectives ; also means possession ; of. 

kirei na : pretty ; clean. wata(ku)shi no : my ; mine. 

riko na : clever. anata no : your ; yours. 

murasaki no : violet (colour). de : a particle. 

oki na : big. da (=de aru) : is. 

chiisa na : small. ja =de wa.

K oto and mono (sometimes abbreviated to won' or no) both mean 'thing'. 
Koto nearly always refers to an abstract tiling ; mono generally to a concrete 
thing. These words and the abbreviations man' and no when used after verbs, 
serve to substantivize the verb and form many important idioms. Observe 
the following : 

koto ga deki'ru after verb (present) koto ga nai after verb (generally past) : 

has the force of a potential. never. 

koto ga aru after verb (generally won' desu ka ? after verb (present) is a 

past) : once ; sometimes. denial of, or protest against, an 

koto ga aru ka ? after verb (generally absurd statement or supposition. 

past): ever ? no desu after a verb has already been 

noticed in Exercise 32.

EXERCISE 117. 

This and the following Exercises consist of anecdotes and stories. Those 
who have mastered the first fifty Exercises may find it profitable and interesting 
to try their hand occasionally at these more difficult constructions ; words and 
phrases which are not known, may be looked up in the Vocabulary, Part III. 

Rokuro wa shio to iu mono wo shirimasen deshlta. lllto ga tabe-mono ni shio

"Sankichi San, sono shiroi mono ica nan to iu mono desu . ? "

"Jddan ja nai. Shio wa nani ni suru mo-no ka shira-nai nante? Anata wa

"So iu benri no mono desu ka? Chitto mo shirimasen deshita. Ja, ddka 
siikosjii kudasaim-asen ka?" 

" E, e, o niochi nasai. Ma, tameshite goran rtasai yo. ' ' 

Rokuro wa shio wo moraimashtta. Tabe-mono ni ireru to sonna ni oishiku nan*

" E ? Nan desu 'tie ? Burei na koto wo itte wa ikemasen. Watashi ga'itsti

"Desu ga, sakki watashi ni shio wa taiso umai mono da nante osshatta desho?

" A, shio no hanashi desu ka? Anata wa baka desti, ne. Mono ni wa hodo ga

Rokuro didn 't know what salt was. He thought it very strange when he saw 
people putting it into their food. 

"I say, Sankichi, what do vou call that white stuff?" 

"This? Why, this is salt/' 

" Eh ? And what do you use it for ? " 

"You are joking. Do you mean to say you don't know what salt is used 
for ? Well, you are a funny fellow ! It's always used in cooking, isn't it ? 
Whether it's fish, or whether it's meat, if it has no salt, it tastes flat." 

"Is it such a useful thing as that? I hadn't the slightest idea. Please 
let me have a little. ' ' 

"Certainly ! Take some. Try and see how you like it." 

Rokuro took the sjilt with him. If salt when 'added to food improves the 
taste so much, he thought that without doubt it would be still nicer if eaten 
by itself. So he put into his mouth all at once the salt he had received from 
Sankichi, but was disagreeably surprised. It was so salty he didn 't know what 
to. do. He got very angry, he went to Sankichi 's house and said : "What a 
liar you are, Sankichi !" 

"What are you saying ? Don 't be rude. When did I tell you a lie ? 

"Didn 't you tell me a short time ago that salt had a very nice taste ? And 
isn't it a lie to say that beastly stuff like this is nice ?" 

"Oh, are you referring to the salt ? You are a fool. Things must^be used 
v.ith moderation. Why ever did you eat so much salt at one time ?"

A man went to see a dentist on account of a decayed tooth. 

"Good day." 

' ' Please sit down in this chair. ' ' 

' ' One of my teeth is very painful. Would you kindly examine it ? " 

1 ' Is that so ? Which one is it ? " 

' ' One of the top teeth on the left-hand side. ' ' 

"Oh, it's this one I suppose. Yes, it does look bod ; it must pain you a 
great deal. ' ' 

" Is it very bad ? What had I better do ? Can you stop it ? " 

"H'm This tooth is too far gone to be stopped. I'll have to draw it." 

' ' Is that so ? Well then, please draw it ; but apply some medicine so that the 
extraction may not be painful." 

"Have no fear. I'll do it so that you'll feel no pain at all." 

And then he pulled out the. tooth. 

* ' Oh, how painful ! Is this what you call a painless extraction ? It hurt me 
very much." 

He felt the place with his finger and found that it was the next tooth which 
had been drawn (and not the bad one). So he got very angry : 

"Oh, that's too bad. You've gone and pulled out the next tooth which was 
perfectly sound." 

' ' Let me see. Well I never ! Yes, I made a mistake ; I am indeed very sorry 
for you. I'll draw the other one." 

"Oh, this is terrible!" 

"You needn't be anxious. I shall only charge you for one !"

At a certain shop there was an errand boy who had recently arrived from 
the country. The master of the shop called the boy : 

"Chomatsu, do you know where the pillar-box is ?" 

"Yes, I do." 

"Where is it?" 

"(Going out from here) you go to the right along this big road, you turn 
at the chemist's shop and go a little further on ; it is on the left-hand side." 

"Very well then, go and post this letter ; here is ten sen, you must buy a 
three-sen stamp. Do you know what the change will be ?" 

Chomatsu thought a little while (and said) : 

"Seven sen." 

"That's right ; well then, take care and don't make a mistake. As theft is 
a lot of work to be done, don't waste your time on the road. Do you under- 
stand ? ' ' 

"Yes, I understand." 

Chomatsu went out with the letter and the ten sen. 

When he came back (he said to his master) : 

"Master, I am back." 

And saying this, he bowed to him. The master (said) : 

"You are back quickly. Did you post the letter ?" 

"Yes, certainly I posted it ; here is the change and the receipt." 

And saying this, he gave his master seven sen and a three-sen stamp.

A certain man went to buy some horses. He bought four, got on to one of 
them and started for home. On the road he began to count the horses, but only 
found three. He thought that by mistake they had only given him three. So 
he went back to the house of the man who sold him (the horses). He got off 
the horse, called the master, and said : 

"Didn't I pay just now for four horses ? nevertheless there are only three. 
Isn 't there some mistake ? ' * 

The man answered : 

"Is that so? That is very extraordinary; well, let's count them both 
together. ' ' 

Asid saying so, they went to the place where the horses were. ' : Onc, 
two " and counting thus, they found there were four. 

The buyer said : 

"Oh, if that is so, it's all right." 

And with these words he again got on to a horse, and went on his way. After 
a little while, he counted them again and found there was certainly one wanting. 
He got very angry; when he got back to the seller's house, the seller was very 
much surprised : 

"Have you come back again ? What's the matter now ?" 

" 'What's the matter now ?' do you say ? There is no getting over it that 
there are only three horses. ' ' 

' ' Don 't talk nonsense. ' ' 

"Well, but look ; there are only three aren't there ?" 

"Oh, no. What about the horse you are riding yourself ? You must count 
that one, mustn 't you ? ' '

In a certain place there once lived a man with a bald head. He had no hair 
at all. He was always thinking of how he could manage to make his hair grow. 
One day he said to a friend : 

Ci I am so bald, I am really in great trouble. What would you advise me to 
do to make my hair grow ? ' ' 

"Well, why don't you see Nakamura and see how you get on ?" 

"Did you say Nakamura ? I don't know any doctor of that name. What 
kind of a man is he ? " 

"What, haven't you heard of Nakamura ? He is a very famous doctor." 

' ' Where does he live ? Does he live in this town ? ' ' 

"No, he lives in Kyoto, but he occasionally comes here. He is a very re- 
markable doctor and has obtained some extraordinary results. As he is due 
to arrive here in four or five days, just go and consult him." 

"You don't say so ? If he is such a clever doctor, it's a pity that I didn't 
go and consult him before. You have given me a good piece of news. Thanks 
very much." 

As soon as Dr Nakamura arrived, the bald man went to see him : 

' ' Doctor, a friend told me a few days ago that you were very clever at curing 
all sorts of illnesses, that is why I have come to make a request of you. I am 
bald and on that account I am greatly inconvenienced. I have tried all sorts 
of remedies, but they have been of no use. Please do something to make my 
hair grow. ' ' 

The doctor suid nothing, but took off the cap he was wearing. 

"As you see I also am bald. If I were able to cure your head, I would begin 
by curing my own. "

Mr Yamada was a miser. He used to \venr his coats until they v/ere so worn 

out and torn that his sons could bear the shame of it no longer. 

' ' Father, your coat is very old, isn 't it ? Iladn 't you better buy a new one ? ' ' 
' ; Oh, this one will do, I can wear it still. It is a great deal better to have 

twenty yen than to spend it on a new coat. ' ' 

"You always say that, father, but really your clothes are too awful. Do 

buy yourself some new ones. We all feel very much ashamed. " 

"Even if rny clothes are old, there is no reason to be ashamed of that." 
The sons thought that they must, somehow or other, make him buy a new 

coat. They thought he would, no doubt, buy one, if it were cheap, so they 

went to the tailor and talked it over. They arranged with the tailor that he 

should sell their father a twenty-yen coat for seven yen, and they themselves 

would pay thirteen yen. 

"Father, we saw a very cheap coat at the tailor's today. The quality is very 

good, but for some reason or other, he is selling it very cheap he says. Go and 

buy it quickly or else somebody else ma}' get it. ' ' 

' ' You don 't say so ! I don 't mind buying it if it's cheap and good. ' ' 

Mr Yamada went to the tailor's and after beating the price down to six yea 

fifty, he bought the coat. However, when he returned home, he had not the 

coat with him. 

"It was really as cheap as you said, so I bought it for six yen fifty." 

"For six yen fifty ? Well, where is it ? Please show it to us. " 

' ' On my way back, I showed it to a friend in the tram-car, and as he asked 

me to sell it to him for ten yen, I did so. So I gained three yen fifty sen. "

There was once a servant. She was always thinking how she could please her 
mistress ; but as she was a silly girl she didn't know how to set about it. One 
day she met a friend. 

' ' What shall I do in order to please my mistress ? ' ' 

Thus she inquired. The friend (answered) : 

"There's no difficulty about that. Imitate your mistress in everything she 
does : that 's the best way to please her. ' ' 

"Is that so ? Thanks very much for giving me such a good idea. I'll just 
try it. ' ' 

The servant, with the idea of imitating her mistress, took particular notice of 
all her mistress did. Now, this lady had the bad habit of yawning frequently. 
The servant (said to herself) : 

' ' Ah, I ' ve found a good thing. To imitate yawning is easy enough ; anybody 
can do it." 

Thus she thought. And from that time whenever she was in the presence 
of her mistress, she never missed yawning, opening her mouth as wide as she 
could. The lady thought this very strange. 

"Aren't you sleeping ,well of nights lately ?" 

' ' Yes, I 'm sleeping all right. ' ' 

"Then, why are you always yawning ?" 

"It's because I "wanted to please you, madam. I^thought it would 
good thing to imitate you in everything you did " 

The lady got angry (and said) : 

' ' What a fool you are ! It is always a good thing to ^imitate something good, 
but. . . (do not imitate another person's bad habits)."

A robber hid himself behind a tree in a lonely place waiting for people to pass. 
After a little time a man happened to come along. The robber immediately 
jumped out and with a threatening face, said : 

' ' Give me all the money you 've got. ' ' 

"Money ? I have some, it is true, but my wife is ill in bed. I intend with 
this money to buy medicine and some dainties for her to eat, and therefore, it is 
entirely impossible for me to give it to you. ' ' 

"It's no use talking ; give me all the money you've got. It is sure to be a 
lie, your wife being ill and all that. ' ' 

' ' If you think it is a lie, come with me and see. I don 't know what to do ; 
well, I will just keep a little and give you all the rest." 

"Will you never understand what I say ? Your wife's illness is none of my 
business. I've told you to give me all the money you've got. If you want to 
save your life, do quietly as I tell you. ' ' 

The robber aimed his gun at him. The man at last gave the robber his 
purse. 

"Ah, I've lost everything! Therefore, in exchange for what I've given 
you, won 't you at least let me have that gun ? ' ' 

" I 've got the money and that's all I want. If you want the gun here it is. ' ' 

The robber was about to go away. The man called him : 

"Ha, it's my turn now. You'll return the money I just gave you or I'll 
have your life ; one of the two. ' ' 

The robber unconcernedly said : 

" I am very sorry for you, but that gun is not loaded ! ' '

Once upon a time, there was a very timid man. His country was at war and 
he was obliged to go to the war together with the others. And so, as it couldn 't 
be helped, he set forth on a black horse. However, he was so frightened that 
he could not tight. He bedaubed his face and body with the blood of a man who 
had fallen near there ; and he pretended to be wounded and lay down. In the 
meantime, somebody stole his horse. 

After the battle was over, he thought of returning home. However : 

"Supposing somebody were to ask what has become of my horse, what shall 
I say ? 1 really don't know what to do. Ah, I have it ! I'll say that my 
horse was killed in the battle. And as a proof of that, it will be sufficient to 
take a horse's tail along with me." 

And with this idea, he cut off the tail of a vyhite horse that was lying dead 
near him, and started to join the others. A friend said : 

"I say, how did you get on today ?" 

' ' I 've done my very best. I cut off the heads of four or five of the enemy. 
And as you see I have been wounded and I am all covered with blood." 

' ' That was very brave of you. ' ' 

" Oh, I think nothing of a wound like this. I don't grudge even my Ii 
the service of my country." 

"By the way,* what's become of your horse ?" 

"My horse ? He was wounded and fell dead. I was really sorry \ 
And so I brought his tail as a souvenir." 

' ' Don 't joke. Yours was a black horse, wasn 't he ? He can t possibly h 
turned white all of a sudden." 

The coward didn't know what to answer.

An old man and his son were going along a road ; the old man was riding a 
horse, and his son was following on foot. When people saw this, they said : 
"Look at that cruel old man ! He makes his son walk while he himself is 
riding." 

The old man thought : "Ah, what those people say is right. I must make 
the boy ride. " So he got down from the horse, and he told the child to get on 
to it. 

After a while : " Look, what a rude boy that is ! He makes an old man like 
that walk while he himself is riding ; it's enough to disgust anybody. As he is 
fairly big, he ought to be able to do any amount of walking. ' ' 

The lad thought : "By Jove! What those people say is true. " So he got 
down from the horse and he and his father continued on foot. 

After they'd gone a little distance somebody who was passing said : ' ' W T hat 
fools those men are ! Just look ! Without making use of that strong horse in 
any way, they are just pulling it along. I would never have dreamt such fools 
existed. ' ' 

They felt that that was true. So now they both got on the horse. 

A certain man seeing this, said : "What hard-hearted fellows those are ! 
It's too bad for those two men to be riding on that poor horse. Why, it can 
hardly walk. ' ' 

Father and child when they hdard this, both got down from the horse. And 
then with a cord which happened to be there, they tied the horse's legs to a 
pole, and they carried him along. When they came to a bridge, a lot of men 
saw this strange sight. And as they laughed and made a great noise, the horse 
got frightened and began to move. The result was. that it fell into the river 
and died.

A certain man thought it strange that other people's fields should yield good 
crops of corn, while every year his ov.n should only yield a little. So he went 
to make inquiries of his next-door neighbour. 

"Good day ! I have come today because there is something I want to ask 
you about. It seems that you always have a good crop in your field ; but I 
can do nothing with mine no matter how good the seed may be. I wonder 
what the reason is ?" 

' ' Is that all you want to know ? Oh, there 's no special reason. ' ' 

"Well, but 'as I cannot get good results, won't you please tell me what 
to do?" 

4 ' Oh, there's no difficulty about the matter. If the ground is hard the corn 
will not grow well. So loosen the soil, aad if you then sow good seed you will be 
sure to get a good crop. ' ' 

"I am very n.uch obliged to you ; now I understand. I will be sure to go 
about it properly tins year." 

So following the advice he had received, he dug the field as hard as he could 
and loosened the soil. However, when the time came to sow the seed, a difficulty 
arose. 

' If I go into the field to sow the seed the soil will again become hard and all 
my labour will have been in vain. I wonder what 1 can do." 

And thinking over it he struck on a good plan. He thought that if he got 
on a horse to'sow the seed, he would avoid treading the earth. So he did as 
he had planned. IJut then, though he did not as a matter of fact press the 
ground with his own feet, the horse trod all over the field with his four feet.

Many years ago, there was a bean-vender called Kichibei. Once a relation of 
his died, and he unexpectedly received a hundred yen out of what that man left 
when he departed this life. Now Kichibei lived all by himself. On the one hand 
he couldn't go to his work and leave the money behind him. On the other, he 
couldn't go out every day with so much money on him. "What had I better 
do ?" he thought ; and he lifted up one of the mats, and hirl the money under- 
neath. However, as he was still anxious, before going out and after returning 
home, he would lift the mat to see if the money was safe. 

It happened that just in front of his house, there lived a man who never had 
any fixed work to do. When this man saw these strange proceedings : 

' ' This is very curious. Now, why does Mr Kichibei do such an extraordinary 

thing every day ? No doubt he's got something under that mat. When 

Mr Kichibei is out, I will just go and find out. " 

One day when Kichibei went out to sell his beans, as he was accustomed to 
do, this inquisitive man entered the house quietly, lifted up the mat and looked 
underneath. When he did so, there were the hundred yen wrapped up in paper. 

"Oh, now I understand. It's useless for all this money to be lying here 
idle. I'll use it for him.;' 

The idle man, smiling, took the money, replaced the mat, and made off. 

The bean-vender who hadn't got a notion of what had happened during his 
absence, as usual, when he came back, lifted up the mat and looked underneath. 
When he did so, he found that nothing was left of his precious treasure. 

"Ah, I can enjoy peace of mind at last! My anxiety has disappeared. 
What a good thing !" (he said).

An old woman lost the use of her eyesight, so she called a doctor. 

"Doctor, if you cure my eyes and make me see the same as I used to former- 
ly, I will pay you handsomely ; however, if T do not get better I will give you 
nothing at all. Do you agree to this arrangement ? ' ' 

This is what she said and the doctor agreed to it. 

The doctor went occasionally to the old woman's house and put some medicine 
in her eyes. And every time he went he took away with him, without the old 
woman knowing it, one of her utensils. 

After some time the old woman's eyes got better. 

' ' Well, how are you ? You can see quite well, can 't you ? So please pay 
me what you promised. ' ' 

However, the old woman was very much surprised as she could not find 
several of the utensils and pieces of furniture which she had before she was ill. 
So she made an excuse and did not pay the doctor any money. The doctor 
got angry : 

' Old lady, you are cheating me. Didn't you expressly promise to pay me 
if you got well ? Anyhow, if you don't do as you promised, 1 will complain to 
the police." 

The police called the old woman to the police station and questioned her : 

' ' It seems that you promised to pay the doctor if he cured you. Well, why 
don't you pay what you promised ?" 

"You are right ; I certainly did promise to pay a lot of money if I got well, 
but if I did not get well, I was to pay nothing. The doctor said the other day 
that I was well. However, I cannot see my desk, pots, plates, knives, and other 
things which were formerly in the house. ' '

A servant called Take was very careless. She was always breaking plates, 
tumblers and tea-cups. One day her mistress said : 

' ' Look here, Take, although I am always telling you to be careful not to 
break the crockery, you don't seem to understand, so I don't know what to 
do with you. Don't you see that you must really be more careful ? However 
did you manage to break a good plate like that ? ' ' 

"Madam, 1 am very sorry. This is how it happened." 

And with these words she let fall another plate and smashed it into pieces.

A certain man once received a walking-stick as a present from a friend. As 
it was a splendid and fashionable stick he was very pleased. But when he was 
going out for a walk and wished to use it, he found it was a little too long. So 
he called at an umbrella-shop. 

"(iood day. This stick is too long. Would you kindly cut a piece off ? I 
would like it two inches shorter." 

" It 's a very fine article, isn 't it ? Yes, I see ! It does seem a little too long. 
I will do as you wish. 1 will cut it immediately so just wait a moment, please. 

As the shop-assistant was about to cut off the lower part of the stick, the 
guest in a great hurry stopped him. 

"I say, hold on. The long part is not at the bottom, it's at the top."

ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 

OF THE 

JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 



CHAPTER I. 



WRITING AND PRONUNCIATION. 

1. The Japanese characters are of two kinds : 

a) The Kanj i (or Honji), a collection of several thousand signs or ideographs 
of Chinese origin. Each of these Kanji signs corresponds not to a sound but to 
an idea. Two or three thousand of these characters are known to persons of 
moderate education, and this number is sufficient to read the newspapers and 
write about everyday matters. 

b) The Kana, a collection of signs and diacritical marks in which each sign 
corresponds to the sound of a syllable. 

2. No signs in Japanese correspond to our notion of letters. 

3. The simple syllables of the Japanese language are : 



a ; ka ga 


sa za 


ta da 


na 


ha /HI pa 


ma 


ya 


ra 


wa 




i 


ki gi 


shi ji 


chi ji 


ni 


hi hi pi 


mi 




ri 




n 


u 


ku gu 


su zu 


tsu zu 


nu 


fu bu pu 


mu 


yu 


ru 




^^ 


e 


ke ge 


so ze 


te de 


ne 


he be pe 


me 




re 




s 





ko go 


SO ZG 


to do 


no 


ho bo po 


mo 


yo 


ro 


wo 


2L 



4. The consonant part of the syllables in each column is theoretically sup- 
posed to be the same ; and though the initial sound certainly varies, the average 
Japanese does not perceive the irregularity. It will be readily understood, 
why it is natural in a verb ending, say, in tsu, like tatsu, to find such forms as 
/rtta-rw, tachitai, taieba, into. 

5. The syllables in italics to the right of the black-type ones in 3, are only 
distinguished from the latter in Japanese by diacritical marks. They are not 
to be considered as entirely different sounds, but only as modifications of the 
preceding ones. These modified sounds are called nigori. It is very common, 
especially in compound words, to pass from, say, ta to da and sometimes back- 
wards from da to ta. Thus we have to-dana from to and tana ; nani-take from 
naru and dal~e. 



ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



6. The following syllables are written in Japanese kana with two characters 
each, but they are not really dipthongs : 



sha 


J a 


cha 


j* 


shu 


JU 


chu 


JU 


sho 


JO 


cho 


jo 



7. The dipthongal syllables in Japanese are : 



kya gya 


nya 


hya bya pya 


my a 


rya 


kyu gyu 


nyu 


hyu hi/ a pyu 




ryu 


kyo gyo nyo 


hyo byo pijo 


myo 


ryo 



8. Kwa, kzt'o, gu~a. gwo, are frequently written ; but as the w sound in these 
combinations has been entirely dropped by the inhabitants of the centre of 
Japan, we write in this work ka, ko, ga, go. 

Ye is practically never heard now in Tokyo or central provinces, we there- 
fore write e. The y has been retained, however, in the word yen (Japanese 
dollar), as it is printed so pn the bank-notes and cheque forms. 

Wo is generally pronounced o ; but the w is sometimes sounded slightly. 

9. Outside the syllables above mentioned, the average Japanese cannot pro- 
nounce anything else. For instance, he can say, to ; but he cannot say the 
English words, 'tea ' or 'too'. 

10. Japanese is pronounced approximately as follows : 



a 

ai 

au 

ch 

e 

ei 

g 

11. 



o 

ou 
s 
u 



i in machine, 
o in more, 
ou in though. 
s in sat. 
u in put. 



The other letters as in English. 



a in father. 

ai in aisle. 

ow in cow. 

ch in child. 

e in pen. 

ei in rein. 

sometimes as in goat ; some- 
times the sound of ng in king. 

The component elements of double consonants must each be given its 
value in pronunciation. The following are found in Japanese : kk, ss, U, nn, 
pp, mm; also : ssh (=slish), tch (=clich), Us (=tsts). Even in English we have 
some words with the double consonants sounded ; book-keeper, unnatural, 
mis-spel, etc. 

12. The long vowels (a, e, 6, u) must be pronounced long. They are about 
equivalent to double an ordinary vowel. Thus ba-smi is about equal to ba-a- 
san ; Osaka to O-osaka. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 



1 3. The i and u are often hardly audible ; they are then written in this book 
i, H. With regard to these short vowels, it must be observed that, though there 
is in Japanese a clear and sharp distinction between an ordinary vowel and a 
long one, and this difference is indicated in the kana writing, no such clear dis- 
tinction exists between an ordinary vowel and a short one. There is a gradual 
falling off in the length of the syllable until we reach vanishing point, and it is 
difficult to determine when you should begin using the short mark. Authors 
are not agreed on the subject and the average Japanese fails to recognize any 
difference at all. Note also that these short vowels are not pronounced equally 
short by everybody ; and that they are often lengthened on account of the 
following sound or for the sake of emphasis. 

14. Besides the frequent changes due to nigori, note the following vagaries 
of pronunciation : 

1) There is a growing tendency in Tokyo to use double consonants : 

for tada. 
doko ka. 
bakari. 
kore bakari. 
sore kiri. 
atatakai.

iro-iro na. 
In the gerundial termination of adjectives : 

-kutte for -kute. 

2) Contractions and corruptions : 

a) Ira after asoko, koko, soko and doko, may lose the i, as : 

sokora for soko-lra. 

b) I'm (and less frequently iku and irassharu) after a gerund may lose 

the i, as : 

shiteru for shite iru. 

c) The final e of the gerund, may be dropped when followed by the verb 

oku, as : 

kaitoila for kaite oita. 

d) The final te of a gerund followed by the postposition wa may be con- 
tracted to cha, as : 

necha for nete wa. 

e) The final de (the nigori of te) of a gerund or the postposition de, followed 
by the postposition aa, may be contracted to ja (the nigori of cha), as : 

yonja for yonde wa. 

f) The final syllable te or de of a gerund and the first two syllab.es 
ol the verb shimau are contracted to cha or ja, as :

shiroi for hiroi. kire na for kirei na. ibi for yubi. 
chigoe chigai. kairu kaeru. iku yuku. 
iiya lie. as&ko asoko. igoku ugoku. 

Some of these last changes are admissible, but others (especially the very 
common use of shi for hi) are decidedly incorrect and should be avoided. If, 
however, an e is found at the end of the first component in a compound word 
it often not only may, but must be changed to a : 

ama-mizu from ame mizu. 

6) Besides the cases mentioned above in 2), wa suffers contraction after many 
words ; the following are a few samples : 

nya for ni wa. konda for kondo wa. atsuka for atsuku wa. 

nd no wa. sorya sore wa. 

7) The above lists are incomplete even as regards common words ; however, 
they are enough to show the student what to expect, and to put him on his 
guard. 

t5. Japanese words are pronounced with an equal or almost an equal stress 
on each syllable. However, there is sometimes a slight accent on the syllable 
preceding a double consonant, and on the syllable containing a long vowel. A 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 



short vowel makes the syllable short, and, as a consequence, often throws an 
accent on a neighbouring syllable. 

16. It must be remembered that written explanations about pronunciation 
are generally of little use, and that the only way to acquire a good accent is to 
try to imitate a native and. if possible, forget how the word is written. 

1 7. The Japanese have nothing to correspond to the idea of ' word ' as we 
understand it ; and in their writing, whether kanji or kana, there is no separa- 
tion between the words. 

18. Compound words are extremely numerous in Japanese and are to be 
found in all stages of coalescence. Considerable disagreement seems to exist 
between the best writers as to whether certain words should be written separate- 
ly, joined by a hyphen or amalgamated into one word. In this work a word 
like tabe-mono (tabe'ru to eat, mano a thing) anything to eat, is written as a 
compound ; on the other hand kakemono (kake'ru to hang, mono a thing) which 
is not any hanging thing, but is the name given to hanging scrolls only, is written 
in one word. The honorific o has sometimes entirely lost its meaning as in 
anaka (o honourable, naka inside) belly ; in this case we write one word. Some- 
times it still retains its meaning at least vaguely, but is almost inseparable 
from certain words : o-jigi (o honourable, jigi salutation) a bow ; these words 
we write as compounds. In combinations like o cha (o honourable, cha tea) 
we find that the honorific is used in the majority of cases, but sometimes the 
word cha in this same meaning, is used without the o : in this case we write the 
words as separate. 

19. It frequently happens that the meaning of a compound is not equal to 
the sum of the meanings of the components, but has a specific or proper mean- 
ing of its own. We have already seen the case of kakemono 'a hanging scroll' ; 
again aomono 'vegetables', from aoi 'green' and mono 'thing' is not the same 
as aoi mono. A green anything would be an aoi mono, but not necessarily an 
aomono ; on the other hand a carrot, which is reddish, is an aomono but not an 
aoi mono. > 

20. \Yords very frequently suffer modifications in their sound when they 
enter into composition. The most common case of all, is to change the first 
syllable of the second component into its corresponding nigori'ed syllable. (5). 

Note also that the final n of the first component is pronounced m before b, m 
or p. The euphonic changes of the numerals are explained in 280. 

21 . Numerous examples of how compounds are formed may be found in nn. 
151 et seqq.; 181 ; 182; 236-245. 

22. Our grammatical notions and terminology do not apply well to Japanese, 
any more than do the words carriage or cart correspond to a rikisha. This 
must be borne in mind throughout, when the Japanese language is explained 
in terms of English (or any other European) grammar. 



CHAPTER II. 



VERBS. 



CONJUGATION, 

23. Japanese verbs have no person or number. 

24. Negation is not expressed as in English by adding a negative adverb ; 
there is a complete negative conjugation in Japanese. 

25. There is no form of the Japanese verb that really corresponds to our 
infinitive. We shall however apply this name to the inflexion by which the 

-verb is usually named by Europeans. 

26. Most verbs are capable of forming by means of certain terminations, in- 
finitives of the passive, potential and causative voices. All these infinitives 
are then conjugated regularly. 

27. The following is not an attempt at giving a complete or scientific con- 
jugation of the Japanese verb ; this is long and complicated. The author has 
only endeavoured to show the easiest way of forming those parts of the verb 
in most common use.

12 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 

30. With regard to Table I, the column 1 gives the termination of the verbs 
as found in the vocabularies of this work (also as in Hobart-Hampden and 
Parlett's English-Japanese Dictionary, and in the author's -English- Japanese 
Conversation Dictionary}. 

31. As all verbs ending in em and iru do not form their bases in the same 
way, some have been distinguished by a decimal point (e'ru ; i'ru). Those 
which, as written in this book, end in e'ru, belong to the 2nd conjugation in 
Prof. Chamberlain's classification; and those in i'ni, to the 3rd conjugation. 
All other verbs belong to the 1st conjugation.* 

32. Table II shows what terminations are to be added and to which base 
they must be added. 

33. The first form of the negative future is singular in that, in the case of 
verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations, the termination mai is added to that, 
part of base 1 that comes before the point : thus, we have nemai and not neru- 
mai for the negative future of ne'ru ; mimai and not minimal is the negative 
future of mi'ru. 

34. In order to conjugate any verb, first form the bases as per Table I ; and 
then add to the proper base the termination shown in Table II. Take the verb 
yobu, for instance. According to the first line of Table I we have as bases: 
1 yobu, 2 yobi, 3 yond, 4 yoba, 5 yob, 6 yob. Now add to the proper base the 
termination shown in Table II. 

MOODS AND TENSES. 

35. General remarks. Many tenses in Japanese, have a simple form as 
yobu, corresponding to the passing act, and a compound form (composed of the 
gerund and the auxiliary verb i'ru or oru] as yonde iru, which corresponds to 
the continued act or state. Thus yobu means 'I call' ; yonde iru 'I am calling' : 
kawaku 'to dry'; kawaite iru 'to be dry'. The continuativc forms are used in 
Japanese more than in English : icakatte iru, I understand. (See 99). 

36. Yobu and yonde iru have the same meanings respectively as yobiniaxu 
and yonde imasu ; but the latter are more polite. In Table II (see 29), in each 
case in which a distinction is to be made, the polite forms are at the end of the 
tense. (See also 359 et scqq.). 

37. The Japanese sometimes use the negative where we use the affirmative : 
ko-nai uchi ni. before he comes. (See also 415 et seqq.). 

*The verbs in eru or ini which have not this decimal point, i.e. which belong to the 1st 
conjugation are few. The following are the commonest : 

heru to diminish ; ehimeru to become hairu to enter ; maim to come, go ; 

kaeru to return ; damp ; ijiru to meddle with ; negiru to cheapen ; 

Jceru to kick ; suberu to slip ; iru to enter, need ; shim to know. 

shaberu to gossip ; teru to shire ; kiru to cut : 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 13 

38. Present and Probable Present or Future. The dominant idea of the 
Japanese present tense is the idea of certainty. It is used for the present, for 
general statements, and for those things in the future which are considered 
certain. It is also used for interrogations regarding the future of the 2nd per- 
s on ; sometimes also of the 3rd person. 

Arukimasu ; he walks. 

Nikon no shokuji zva tabe-nyisen ; I don 't eat Japanese food. 

Ashita Tokyo e ikimasu ; I shall go to Tokyo tomorrow. 

Ashita Tokyo e, irasshaimasu ka ? are you going to Tokyo tomorrow ? 

39. The Japanese probable present or future means uncertainty, and is used 
when speaking of those things of the future which are considered uncertain ; 
also when expressing or asking for an opinion and in interrogations of the 1st 
person future. 

Ashita tea ame ga furu dtslio ; it will probably rain tomorrow. 
Mono-oki ni aru desho ; I think there are some in the pantry. 
IVatakushi ga mairimasho ka ? shall I go ? 

40. By adding desho (or less politely daro) . to the forms of the present we 
obtain forms of the probable present. 

.4?io hito zca Ei-go ga dekiru desho ; I expect that man can speak English. 

41 . Various forms of the probable present, especially those in daro or desho 
often have a quasi-interrogative force, about equivalent to 'as you probably 
know' 'as you will probably agree' 'isn't that so ?' 

Yubin-kyoku no mae ni oki na kusuri-ya ga aru desho ? sono tonari desu ; 
there is a big drug-store in front of the post office, isn't there? well, it (the 
place I am speaking of) is next door to that. 

42. The forms yobo, yonde iyo, yobimasho and yonde imasho when used alone 
refer generally to the 1st person. They are often used to announce a decision 
which has just been taken by the 1st person or to invite the 2nd person to co- 
operate with the 1st ; in this latter case it corresponds to the 1st person plural 
imperative. Iko or ikimasho ; I '11 go. or let us go. 

43. These forms, however, followed by to omou or to shite may refer to any 
person : iko t> omou, I (you, he, etc.) intend to go ; ikd to shite, being about to 

go. 

44. The forms yobu desho and yoba-nai desho are generally used for the 2nd 
and 3rd persons only ; however, when desho has the quasi-interrogative force 
mentioned in 41, they are used for any person. 

45. The forms yonde iru daro and yonde i-nai daro are used for all pel 
when the state and not the passing act is meant. 

46. The following examples may serve to illustrate the difference 1 
the Japanese present and future : 

ltd San wa ashita Tokyo e ikitnasu ka ? will Mr Ito go to Tokyo tomorrow ? 



14 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



ltd San wa ashita Tokyo e iku desho ka ? do you think Mr Ito will go to Tokyo 
tomorrow ? 

In the first case I inquire about the fact of somebody who, I think, ought 
to know (e.g. Mr Ito 's employer) ; in the second case I ask for an opinion. 

47. A common emphatic form of speech consists of a) the second base, b) tea 
or koso, c) the verb sum. This idiom is especially common w r ith sum in the 
negative ; and more particularly so with suru in the negative present. The 
meaning may refer to the future, the present or even the past. 

Iki wa shi-nai ; I certainly will not go, (do not go or did not go). 

48. When the negative past tense of suru is used, the meaning is past ; shimai 
(negative future) is used in the 2nd or 3rd person in hypothetical cases. 

49. Before the negative of suru, vca is often corrupted to ya.* 

50. The Japanese present has sometimes a past meaning : 
Shimbun yea mada mimasen ; I have not seen the newspaper yet. 

Taifien ame ga furimasu kara ikimasen deshita; it rained so much 1 did not go. 
See also 99. . , 

51. The English present is often translated by the Japanese past. (See 56). 

52. For the Japanese present followed by to, see 67. 

53. Past and Probable Past. Just as there is a certain present and a prob- 
able present in Japanese, there is also a certain past and a probable past. 

54. By adding desho (or less politely daro} to the forms of the past tense, we 
obtain forms of the probable past. 

55. Desho (or daro) may again have the quasi-interrogative force mentioned 
in 41. 

56. The certain past is often used in Japanese when we in English use the 
present. Wakarimashita may mean: 'I understood' or 'I understand'. 
Bikkuri shita ; 'I was surprised' or 'I am surprised'. This is especially com- 
mon with inchoative verbs, (114). 

57. The first form of the past tense followed by 'tie may be translated by 
'even if : Ame ga futta 'tte ikimasu ; I shall go even if it rains. 

The corresponding construction in the negative is slightly irregular : Ko- 
nakutta 'tie ; even if he doesn 't come ; see 200, 5, foot-note. 

58. Gerund. The gerund is perhaps the inflexion that is in most frequent 
use.f (Compare 200). 

1) It is used before auxiliary verbs, as : motte iru to be carrying; kaite am 
it is written ; (98 et seqq.). 

*Before ya the final i of the base is often dropped : ikya shi-nai, for iki ya shi-nai. 

(The gerund ending in mashile may be used only in cases similar to those noted under 
3), 4); 5), 7), 9), 10), 11), 12) and 14). 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 15 

2) The first of two verbs when they do not form a compound is put in the 
gerund : motte hunt to bring. (Compare 151). 

3) The verb that ends a clause, or is followed in English by 'and' is put in 
the gerund : Han tvo katte kaerimaslilta ; he bought a book and returned home. 

4) After the translation of the gerund, we must sometimes use other con- 
junctions besides 'and' : Hajime atte ozcari ga nai ; there was a beginning but 
there is no end. 

5) It sometimes expresses instrumentality : Kuruma wo hiite kurashimasu; 
he makes his living by pulling a rikisha. 

6) It may signify the reason or cause : Ame ga futte ika-nakatta ; as it was 
raining I did not go. 

7) It often corresponds to 'so' in English : Ashi ga itande shiyo ga nai ; my 
feet hurt me so I don't know what to do. 

8) It is sometimes translated by a preposition : Himo zco motte ircaku ; to 
tie with a string. 

!4) Followed by mo it means 'even it" 'although'* : Ame ga futte mo ikimasu ; 
I will go even if it rains. 

10) Followed by ii, it has a slight imperative force* : Tabete ii ; eat it. Ima 
iits yd gozaimasu ka ? shall I go now ? do you wish me to go now ? 

11) Followed by mo ii it means permission, concession* : after an affirmative 
gerund it may be rendered by 'may' ; after a negative gerund by ' need not'. 
Kaette mo ii ; you may return home : ika-nakute mo ii ; you needn't go. 

12) Wa following the gerund is emphatic; it is often used in sentences that 
contradict what another person has said, or that express a protest, doubt, 
threat, regret, etc. Note that -te wa, -de wa, are familiarly contracted respec- 
tively into -cha and -ja. Nete wa (nechd) i-nai ; oh, no, he is not asleep, lite 
wa (itcha) do desu ka ? what do you say to going there ? 

13) The affirmative gerund followed by wa, or the negative gerund in nakute 
followed by wa. has often a sort of conditional meaning : Yokohama e hikkoshite 
wafuben de gozaimasu; it would be inconvenient for me (if I were) to move 
to Yokohama. Ame ga jutte wa komaru ; (a) if it were to rain I would be incon- 
venienced ; (b) 1 am inconvenienced by this rain. 

Wa after a gerund sometimes means repetition . Itazura wo shite tea shi- 
karareru ; (a) if you get up to mischief you 'II be scolded ; (b) he is often scolded 
as he is always up to mischief. 

The tea is sometimes dropped when the meaning is repetition : Hana wo 
totte komaru; I don't know what to do as he is (you are) always picking my 
flowers. 

*The meanings of mo, ii and mo ii after a gerund are not always as indicated above : 
consult the words mo and yoi in the Vocabulary, Part IT I. 



16 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



14) The gerund followed by wa and ike-nai, (less often nara-nai or dame), 
means that it is wrong or useless to do something. It often corresponds to the 
negative imperative, or to 'must not'. So shite tea ike-nai; 'you must not 
do that', or 'don't do that', (lit. if you do so it won't do). Sonna ni sazcaija 
(stilt-aide zva) ike-nai, 'don't make such a row', (lit. if you make such a row it 
won't do). 

15) The negative gerund in nakute followed by tea and ike-nai (or nara-nai) 
indicates an obligation, and may be translated by 'must': Kaka-nakute tea 
ikemasen ; you must write; (lit. if you do not write that won't do). The 
verb ike-nai (or nara-nai) is sometimes omitted : Ika-nakucJui ; I have to go. 

16) The negative gerund, especially that in -zu, is often translated by 'with- 
out': Kutsu wo tora-zu ni haitte mo ii ; you may go in without taking off your 
boots. Chichi ga nokora-zu koborete shimatta ; every bit of the milk was spilt, 
(nokora-zu, without any remaining over). Kobe wa san-nen bakari nii-nai de im 
aida ni taihen kawarimashita ; I have been three years without seeing Kobe 
and during that time it has changed very much. 

17) Instead of yoba-nai de and yonde i-nai de you occasionally hear the 
corresponding constructions in the masti terminations : yobimasen de, yonde 
imasen de. 

18) The gerund is often used elliptically : 
To zvo akete .... (kure) ; open the door. 

Shitte iru no ni omae zca mo wo tsuite. . . .('shira-nai' to itta) ; although you know, 
you tell a lie .... (and say you don 't know). 

Besides this elliptical use of the gerund, common to men and women, women 
have another, peculiar to themselves, in which the gerund is equivalent to the 
past tense. 

O to-san tea mo o kaeri ni natte ? (natta ka ?) ; is father back already ? E, o 
kaeri ni natte yo ! (=natta yo !) oh, yes ! 

Kono shosetsu zco yonde ? (yonda ka ?) have you read this novel ? 

19) The following constructions are interesting : 
Aruite desu ka ? are you going on foot ? 

Gohan wo tabete (kara) no koto ni nasai ; put it off until after dinner. 

20) The use of the gerund with auxiliary and terminal verbs is shown in 
98 et seqq. 

21) Various contractions of the gerund are noted in 14, 2. 

59. The Imperative; commanding and requesting. The forms shown in 29 are 
a selection from among the numerous ways of commanding, forbidding or request- 
ing. The forms in kudasai are the only polite ones ; the others, especially the 
first ones, savour more or less of a command and should be used only to inferiors. 

The imperative is rendered still more polite by beginning the sentence by 
doka or better still by dozo. Yonde kudasai, is about equivalent to 'please 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 17 

call.' Dozo yonde kudasai, 'please be so kind as to call.' 

60. An order to do and continue to do something is often expressed by the 
gerund followed by the imperative of i'ru, viz. o-ide, o-ide nasai, i nasai or 
irassJiai according to the degree of politeness. 

Koko de matte o-ide ; wait here. 

Mizu wo matte kimasii kara sono aida kore wo motte irasshai ; please hold this 
while I fetch some water. 

An order to continue not doing something is sometimes expressed by the 
negative gerund followed by the imperative of i'ru. 

Oki-nai de irasshai ; don 't get up. 

Kono tegami ni wa shi-go-nichi henji wo dasa-zu ni o-ide nasai ; don 't answer 
this letter for four or five days. 

61 . In the negative imperative dame is often heard instead of ike-nai. 
Otoshlte wa dame ; don 't let it drop. 

62. Instead of kudasai children (especially girls) often say chodai. Kudasai 
(or chodai) by itself means, 'please give it to me', not simply 'please'. Pan wo 
kudasai ; please give me some bread. 

In Japanese, as in English, a request often takes the form of an interrogation : 
Hon wo kashite kudasaimasen ka? A'ould you be kind enough to lend me 
your book ? 

63. As stated in 42 the first person plural imperative is often rendered by 
the Japanese future : Dekakeyo or dekakemasho ; ' let us be going'. To the 
first of these forms is often added in familiar speech ja nai ka? Dekakeyo 
ja nai ka ? let us be going, eh ? 

64. In the imperative, the special honorific verb, if there is one, is generally 
used instead of the corresponding simple verb : thus, practically, o-ide nasai or 
irasshai is the imperative of i'ru to be, kuru to come, and iku to go ; and goran 
nasai, the imperative of mi'ru to look. 

The expressions studied under the titles 'Obligation' 'Permission' and 
'Advice' in 168, 169 and 170 are related to the present subject. 

65. Conditional. The conditional present is often used instead of the past 
and vice versa. Sukoshi ki wo tsukereba koware-nai no ni ; if you had been 
more careful it wouldn't have broken. Dekitara motte kite kudasai ; please bring 
it with you if it is ready. 

In Japanese the conditional and expressions equivalent to a conditional, 
have not only the ordinary conditional meaning, but also serve to express other 
relations between two events, especially that of time. Shigoto ga sumeba nani 
wo shimasu ka ? what are you going to do when you have finished that work ? 

When two conditionals are used in Japanese the second may have the meaning 
of 'so long as' 'provided'. Karifa empitsu wo nakuslntara, onnaji mono wo katte 
kaeseba ii deshd ; if you've lost the pencil you borrowed, it will be all right 



18 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



provided you buy another one like it and return that. 

66. The idea of the conditional is sometimes expressed in Japanese by pla- 
cing nara* after the present or the past (more especially after the less polite 
forms). Nara is also placed after the desiderative form of verbs, after adjectives 
and after nouns : Aite iru nara kashite kudasai ; if you have no use for it at 
present, please lend it to me. Mitai nara tsurete ikimasho ; if you wish to see it, 
I Mill take you. Oishii nara o agari nasai ; if you like it, please take some. Neko 
nara oi-dashlte o kure ; if it is a cat, drive it away. Note also so nara (corrupted 
to sonnara) 'if things are so' *in that case' : Sonnara ikimasho ; if that is so, 
I'll go. 

67. The present tense followed by to is about equivalent to the present con- 
ditional ; it often refers to time and may then be translated by when, while 
as soon as, etc. Taberu to o kd-san ni shikararemastt ; if you eat it, your mother 
will scold you. 

Kane ga naru to klsha ga deru ; when the bell rings, the train starts. 

The above construction is especially common with the less polite forms of 
the present but it is sometimes used with the masu forms. Note that if to is 
followed by iu to say, kiku to hear, omou to think, etc., it serves to indicate a 
direct quotation and has nothing to do with the conditional. (See 427). 

68. The gerund followed by tea has frequently a conditional meaning, see 
58, 13, 14, 15. 

The following expressions are therefore more or less equivalent : 
nomeba = nomu nara = nomu to = nonde tea 

noma-nakereba = noma-nai nara = noma-nai to = noma-nakute wa 

69. The past conditional, like the present, may express other relations besides 
that of condition ; the relation of time is especially common and the translation 
may then be : when, after, as soon as, while, etc. 

Kyo tea ame ga fura-nai to omottara rnata futte kita ; although I thought it 
wouldn't rain today, it has started to rain again. 

Aruitara kutabireta ; I've been walking and I'm tired. 

Hi ni atetara iro ga samete shimatta ; it has been exposed to the sun and the 
colour has entirely faded. 

Dekitara (sugu ni) okutte kudasai ; please send it as soon as it is ready. 

Sore ga sundara sampo shimasho ; when (after) you've finished let's go for a 
walk. 

Tsuitara sugu, ame ga futte kimashita ; he had hardly arrived when it began 
to rain. 

70. By prefixing moshi to the conditional present or past we give it a dis- 
tinctly hypothetical meaning : moshi kitara ; supposing he came. 

*You may say naraba instead of nara ; likewise you sometimes hear as the termination 
of the past conditional -araba for -ara. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 19 

71 . The termination eba of the present conditional is sometimes contracted 
to ya in familiar speech : Ko surya (sureba) ii ; you had better do like this. 

72. The negative present conditional followed by ike-nai or nara-nai may 
be translated generally by 'must' : Ko shi-nakereba narimasen ; it must be done 
in this way, (lit.: it won't do if you don't do it thus). 

73. The present conditional preceded by sae means 'if only' 'provided'. 
Ai sae sureba anshin sum ; if I could only see him my mind would be at ease. 

Toki (ni) tea has sometimes a hypothetical meaning : Moshi tegami ga naku- 
natta toki (ni) tea do shimasho ? what shall I do if the letter should be lost ? 

74. We have already seen that in Japanese the conditional is used in many 
cases in which there is no conditional in English : here are some more 
examples : 

Kuru to omotte yorokonde imashitara kimasen deshita ; I was rejoicing at the 
idea of his coming, but it turned out that he didn 't come. 

Kore ZKO mireba- yasashii yd da keredamo hcmto wa taihen muzukashii ; to look 
at it, it seems easy, but it really is very difficult. 

Sono toki tokei wo mimashitara ju-ji sugi deshita; on looking then at the 
clock, I found it was past ten. 

Nih&n-go mo lianaseba ji mo kakemasu ; he can not only speak Japanese but 
he can also write it. 

K iite mireba riko na hlto da ; judging from what one hears, he must be a 
clever fellow. 

Kikeba byoki datta so desu ; I hear that he has been ill. 

Ato de kiitara uso deshita ; I inquired afterwards and it turned out not to 
be true. 

Nippon mo kawareba kazcaru mon ' da ; how Japan has changed ! 

Do oshietara ii desho ; how shall I explain it to them ? 

Ikeba ikareru ; you can go (but 1 think you had better not). 

Mi mo shi-nakereba kiki mo shi-nai ; I neither saw nor heard anything. 

Nedan mo yasukereba shina mo ii ; the price is cheap and the quality good. 

Yoku mireba miru hodo kirei desu ; the more carefully I look at it the prettier 
1 find it. 

75. The Japanese are very fond of elliptical idioms. In these a conditional 
is often found. See 414, 4. 

76. Frequentative. The frequentative form is used when acts or states 
occur by turns. It is frequently used in pairs, the second member being general- 
ly followed by the verb sura. An 'and' is often introduced between the two 
verbs in the English version : SJiabettari warattari shite ua de zca arimasen ka ? 
weren 't you talking and laughing ? 

The frequentative is sometimes used when there is no repetition : 

Do shite icatashi no hana vso tottari shimasu ka ? what do you mean by picking 



20 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



my flowers ? Note that in English you use the plural (a kind of repetition) 

though only one flower may have been picked. 

The frequentative is occasionally used in a distributive sense : 

Kodomo-tachi tea hon wo yondari, e wo kaitari, Jcitte wo mitari shite imasu ; 

some of the children are reading books, some are drawing pictures, and some are 

looking at postage stamps. 

77. Desiderative. The desiderative form is an adjective and has all the 
inflexions of one. (See 192 et seqq.). 

78. Like an adjective it has also a corresponding abstract noun in -sa ; e.g.: 
from ikitai , 'wishing to go,' we get ikitasa, 'the wish to go'. This abstract 
noun, generally followed by ni, refers to the reason or cause of an action. 

kd-san no kao ga mitasani toi tokoro kara kimashlta; I have come from very 
far because I was longing to see my mother. 

79. The desiderative is not used in the 3rd person unless followed by to iu r 
to mosu or no desu. 

The object of the desire often, but not always, becomes the subject and takes- 
ga : Kamakura ga mitaku wa arimasen ka ? don 't you wish to see Kamakura ? 

80. By changing the final i to gam we form a verb ; e.g.: from ikitai, ' wishing 
to go', we get ikitagaru, 'to wish to go'. 

81. The Second Base or Stem. The second base of a verb is very important 
and has to be referred to frequently : we will call it the stem. 

82. The stem of a verb: 1) is very often used as a noun as may be seen 
in several of the following cases. 

2) Followed by suru it sometimes takes the place of the ordinary inflexions 
of the verb : (o) hanashi suru uchi hi ; while w r e were talking. 

3) Preceded by o and followed by certain verbs, it forms polite substitutes, 
for the ordinary inflexions of the verb. See 359-360. 

4) Followed by wa and suru it is emphatic. See 47-49. 

5) Followed by ni, it signifies the motive or object of an action : Tori ni 
Mmashtta ; he came to fetch it. 

6) Followed by nagara, it generally means that two actions are carried on 
simultaneously : Warai nagara kodomo ni omocha wo yarimashita ; laughing, 
he gave a toy to the child. 

7) Followed by nagara it sometimes has an adversative sense : Warui to 
shiri nagara shita ; he did it, though he knew it was wrong. 

8) Followed by gake ni, it means 'on the way' ; this construction is especial- 
ly common in connection with the verbs iku to go, and kaeru to return : Kaeri- 
gake ni yorimashita ; I called on my way back. 

9) When a sentence is composed of two or more parallel propositions, we 
may use the stem of the verb at the end of each member except at the end of 
the last one which takes an ordinary verbal inflexion : Shiroi hana mo an, akai 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 21 

no mo ari, aoi no mo arimasu ; some flowers are white, some red, and some 
blue. 

10) When the stem ends in ri and is followed by the verb nasaru, the final ri 
of the stem is sometimes changed to n : o yan nasai for o yari nasai, give it. 

83. The Infinitive. There is no real infinitive in Japanese. The English 
infinitive is translated in a variety of ways : 

1) When it is the subject or object of another verb, by the first forms of 
the present or past followed by koto, to iu koto, no or ho ; all these words serve 
to substantivize the verb : 

Hitori <fe iru to iu koto wa yoku nai koto desu ; it is a bad thing to live by 
oneself. 

Kasa wo motte iku ho ga ii ; it would be better to take an umbrella. 

Hima wo tsubusu no wa warui ; it is bad to waste time. 

tfma wo kawa-nai koto ni kimemashita ; I have decided not to buy a horse. 

2) When it follows a verb of motion and signifies 'for the purpose of or 
" in order to ', by the stem of the verb and ni : 

Tori ni kimashita ; he came to fetch it. 

3) When it follows a verb which is not of motion, and signifies 'for the 
purpose of or 'in order to', by the first forms of the present followed by 
tome ni : 

Komaraseru tame ni shimashita ; he did it to annoy me. 

4) W T hen it follows the means, instrument or agent, by the first forms of the 
present and (no) ni ; the no is sometimes omitted : 

Tegami wo kaku ni kami ga iru ; I want some paper to write a letter. 
Ko-zutsumi wo iwaku no ni tsukaimasu ; I use it to tie up parcels. 
Kore wo ageru no ni tetsudatte kudasai ; help me to lift this. 

5) When it is equivalent to 'for' followed by the present participle, by 
the first forms of the present and (no) ni ; the no is sometimes omitted : 

Kondnimotsu wo teishaba made motte iku no ni, ikura harattara ii desho? how 
much ought I to pay to have (for having) this parcel taken to the station ? 

Mada neru ni wa hayai ; it is still too early to go to bed. 

G) When it signifies 'with the intention of, by the future and to omotte 
or to shile : 

Dekakeyo to omotte boshi wo kaburimashita ; I put on my hat to go out. 

7) When equivalent to a supposition and accompanied by 'it will' or 'it 
would', by some construction with a conditional meaning: 

Ano hito ga okoru to ike-nai kara o yoshi nasai ; it wouldn't do to make that 
man angry so don't do that. 

life mo dame ; it is useless to go. 

Yokohama e hikkoshite wafuben de gozaimasu ; it would be inconvenient for 
me to move to Yokohama. 



22 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



8) After verbs of speaking as : telling, requesting, promising, advising, re- 
fusing, etc., the infinitive is translated by to following the direct quotation or 
by yo ni following the present : 

' Ko-nai ' to kotowarimasliita ; he refused to come. 
Ashita kuru yd ni itte kure ; tell him to come tomorrow. 

9) Sentences belonging to the above class are sometimes translated by the 
causative, sometimes they are entirely changed before*translating : 

Tell Shige to call a rikisha cause Shige to call a rikisha ; Shige ni kuruma 
wo yobashite kure. 

I'll get (tell) the carpenter to make one ; daiku ni koshiraesaseyo. 
Tell O Haru to come=call O Haru ; O Haru wo yonde kure. 
Tell O Haru to go=send O Haru ; O Haru wo yatte kure. 

10) After 'wish' 'want' or 'would like', the infinitive is translated by the 
desidcrative form of the verb: 

Yobitai ; I wish to call. 

11) After 'easy' or 'difficult' etc., the infinitive is translated by the stem 
and yasui or ii (easy), or nikui (difficult) : 

Wakari-nikui ; difficult to understand. 

Koko wa sumi-ii tokoro desu ka ? is this a pleasant place to live in ? 

12) When the infinitive has the meaning of 'must' it is translated in various 
ways : 

Shi-nakereba nara-nai shigoto ga aru ; I have work to do (which I must do). 
Dono michi zvo ikeba ii ka wakarimasen ; I don 't know which road to take. 
Harai ga aritrw.su ka ? is there anything to pay ? 

13) When the meaning is intention, see 173. 

14) Note the following ways of translating the infinitive : 
Kaku hima ga nai ; I have no time to write. 

Chichi wo akambo ni nomashUe o kure ; give the baby some milk to drink. 

Kono heya ni lion wo oku basho ga arimasen ; in this room there's no place to 
put my books. 

Yomu mono ga nai ; I have nothing to read. 

Sara wo ireru hako ; a box to put plates in. 

Naki-dasu ; to begin to cry. 

84. Various Verbal Phrases. The first forms of the present or past when 
followed by koto become substantivized and generally have a meaning in the 
Japanese mind akin to our infinitive, (83, 1) ; but they are not always to be 
translated by the infinitive in English : 

Kurakute yomu koto ga dekimasen ; it is so dark I cannot read. 

Mita koto ga nai ; I have never seen it. 

Kobe e itta koto ga arimasu ka ? have you ever been to Kobe ? 

Itta koto ga gozaimasu ; yes, I have been there. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 23 

85. , The first forms of the present and past may also be made substantives by 
adding mono, mon' or no. The no is often equivalent to mono or koto : 

Kesa itta no tea machigai deshita ; what I said this morning was a mistake. 

It is worthy of note that koto, mono and no may refer not only to the act of 
the verb itself as in the above examples, but also to the thing which is the 
object or subject of the verb. Compare the following examples: 

Kyo wa isogashikutte sore wo sum koto ga dekimasen ; I am very busy today 
I can 't do that ; (the act of doing is impossible). 

Sum koto ga takusan arimasu ; I have a great deal to do ; (things to do). 

Anata no tegami nanzo yomu mon'' (or mono) desu ka ? I'd never dream of 
reading your letters. 

Yomu mono ga nai ; I have nothing to read. 

Dare ga kita no desu ? who came ? 

Kesa kita no wa kono tegami desu ; this is the letter that came this morning. 

86. Especially common is the no desu, (no deshita, etc.) so often heard after 
the verb : it sometimes serves merely to round off a sentence and forms expres- 
sions the meaning of which is practically indistinguishable from that of the 
ordinary inflexions of the verb ; sometimes, however, it has a distinct force 
of its own. The following are some of the commonest combinations with sug- 
gestions for their translation. 

PRESENT. Iku no desu (or da) : go ; shall (will) go ; am going ; should (would) 
go ; must go ; have to go ; am to go ; ought to go. 

PROBABLE PRESENT AND FUTURE. Iku no desho (or daro) : shall (will) probably 
go ; shall (will) probably have to go. 

PAST. Itta no desu (or da) ; ikimashita no desu : did go ; should (would) have 
gone. 

Iku no deshita (or datta) ; itta no deshita (or datta) : should have gone ; ought 
to have gone ; was to go ; was to have gone. 

PROBABLE PAST. Iku no deskltaro (or dattaro) : probably did go ; probably 
would (should) have gone ; probably ought to have gone. 

Itta no deshitaro (or dattaro) : probably did go. 

CONDITIONAL. Iku no desMtora (or dattara) : if go ; if ought to have gone ; 
if I had known you were going. 

Similar constructions may be formed with the compound inflexions, such as, 
yonde iru no desu ; yonde ita no desu ; etc. 

In the case of negative verbs, the negative element may be either in the 
first component or in the second ; e.g. ika-nai no desu or ikunoja arimasen, 
etc. 

87. Examples : 

Ototo wa ashita Tokyo e iku no desu ; my (younger) brother is going to Tokyo 
tomorrow ; my (younger) brother has to go to Tokyo tomorrow. 



24 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Kind amegafura-nakereba iku no de gozaimashlta ; I would have gone yester- 
day, if it had not rained. 

Kimi ga iku nara boku mo itta no daro ; if you had gone, I would probably 
have gone also. 

Watashi mo asuko e itta no deshita ga samui kara sugu kaetta no desu ; I also 
went there, but as it was cold I soon came back. 

Kane sae areba watashi mo itta no desu ; if I had only had money, I also would 
have gone. 

Ani to issho ni iku no deshita ga, kaze wo hiita no de, yameta no desu ; I ought 
to have gone with my brother, but as I caught a cold I had to give up the 
idea. 

kyaku no kuru no ga wakatte iru no deshitara, ika-nakatta no desho ; if he 
had known that a visitor was coming, he probably would not have gone. 

Anata ga uchi e kuru no deshitara, watashi wa mise e iku no ja arimasen deshita ; 
if I had known you were coming to my house, I wouldn 't have gone to the 
office. 

88. Women often say no elliptically for no desu, no desu ka ? etc. 
Kippu wa aru no ? have you got your ticket ? 

E, aru no ; yes, I have. 

89. On the other hand the no is sometimes corrupted into n' or even dropped 
altogether : 

Tokyo e iku n' desu ; I am going to Tokyo. 

Soko kara mo ikeru desu ; you can also go from there. 

90. Verbs may sometimes, like nouns, take a postposition without the words 
no, koto or mono intervening : 

Motte kuru ga ii ; you had better bring it. 

91 . Observe the constructions of which the following are examples : 

Hau dokoro ja nai, yoku arukimasu or hau no hawa-nai no 'tie, yoku aruki- 
masu ; it is no case of creeping, I can tell you ; why, he walks beautifully ! 

Okotta no okora-nai no ja nai, o-okori ni okotta ; he didn 't simply get angry, 
he got into a towering rage. 

IRREGULAR VERBS. 

92. The verbs sum, kuru and iku form their bases irregularly as shown in 
28 ; but the common inflexions of these verbs are formed regularly from the 
bases. However, the passive infinitives of suru and kuru are sare'ru and 
korare'ru, and the causative infinitives sase'ru and kosase'ru respectively. 
See Vocabulary, Part III : suru ; kuru f iku. 

93. The verb aru 'to be, to have', is especially noticeable on account of its 
negative forms.

26 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



95. It will be noticed that in the negative, de is generally followed by wa : 
de wa is often contracted to ja. 

96. The polite verbs gozaru, ossharu, nasaru, kudasaru, and irassharu drop 
the letter r of their last syllable when the suffix masu is used, as it generally 
is : the verb gozaru, indeed, is practically never heard except in the masu in- 
flexions. The last three verbs have as imperative nasai, kudasai, and irasshai ; 
they often drop the letter a before tt ; thus : irash 'tie for irasshatte, nas 'ttara for 
nasattara. Note that in this case irassharu also drops one of its ss. 

97. Causative verbs end in -se'ru : their 3rd base is irregular, viz. -shit ; but 
the regular form -set is also sometimes used. 

AUXILIARY AND TERMINAL VERBS. 

98. The verb i'ru (or oru) following the gerund serves to form inflexions that 
indicate a state or a continued act. The verb i'ru is generally preferred in the 
centre of Japan, but in the provinces, oru is often heard. Instead of i'ru, the 
honorific verb irassharu or o-ide nasaru may be used. 

Kutabirete iru ; I am tired. 

Naite iru ; he is crying. 

Hon wo yonde irasshaimasu ; he is reading a book. 

The i of i'ru is often dropped colloquially after a gerund, thus : naiteru for 
naite iru. 

The gerund of an intransitive verb followed by i'ru (or oru) is generally 
translated into English by means of the past participle or an adjective, some- 
times however by the present participle, but in either case the English must 
express the idea that the subject has reached a certain state and continues in 
that state. 'To be moving' means that the subject has reached the state of 
motion and continues in that state, it is therefore the correct translation of 
ugoite i'ru ; but 'to be dying' means that the subject is approaching death, 
and therefore is not the translation of shinde i'ru, the proper translation is ' to 
be dead'. Likewise, 'to be lying down' means that the subject has attained 
the horizontal position and continues in that position, it is therefore the correct 
translation of nete i'ru ; but ' to be drying ' means to be approaching the state 
of dryness, and therefore is not the translation of kawaite i'ru, the proper trans- 
lation is 'to be dry'. 

Amerika e itta and Amerika e itte iru both mean 'he went to America', but the 
second form implies that he is still there, the first form gives no information 
on that point. 

99. It is interesting to note that a verbal phrase like yonde iru may mean 
not only 'is reading' but 'has read'. 

Ano hlto wa seiyo no shosetsu wo takusan yonde iru ; that man has read a great 
number of foreign novels. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 27 

Ano ojii-san rca hige rco sotte iru ; that old man has shaved off his beard. 

100. The verb aru (or gozaru) following the gerund of a transitive verb means 
that the action of the verb was completed and that things remain in that state ; 
it can generally be translated by the passive in English. 

Furoshiki ni tsutsunde arimasu ; it is wrapped up in a cloth. 

Note also the construction of the polite gerund of an intransitive verb followed 
by gozaru : naorimashite gozaimasu is a very polite equivalent of naotta I have 
recovered. 

101. When two verbs, one intransitive and the other transitive, have cor- 
responding meanings (see 111), the gerund of the intransitive verb followed by 
i'ru (or oru), and the gerund of the transitive verb followed by aru have almost 
identical meanings. Thus : rampu ga kiete iru and rampu wo keshlte aru both 
mean 'the lamp is out (not lighted)'. However, rampu ga kiete iru may be 
said either when the lamp has gone out naturally (e.g. want of oil) or when it 
has been intentionally put out by somebody ; whereas rampu wo keshlte aru is 
said only when the lamp has been put out. 

102. Daro (or desho) following the present tense, makes it into a probable 
present ; following the past tense, it makes it into a probable past. It may 
also have a quasi-interrogative force. See 40 ; 41 ; 54 ; 55. 

103. The verb kuru, (irassharu, o-ide nasaru or mairu) following the gerund, 
adds to the first verb the idea of motion towards the speaker or person addressed ; 
it is, however, often translated by 'go' in English : 

Kippu wo katte kimasho ; I will go and buy a ticket ; (lit. I will buy a ticket 
and come). 

The complex action of buying may be said to consist of three parts : the 
going, the buying, the coming back. In English you mention the first two ; 
in Japanese, the second and third. 

Occasionally the verb kuru which is the second of the two verbs ought logically 
to be the first : 

Omoshiroi koto zco itte kita ; he came and told me a funny story. 

Besides this meaning of motion towards the place where one is speaking, 
kuru after a gerund often means 'coming into being or into existence': 

Ame ga futte kita ; it has begun to rain. 

104. The verb mi'ru (or goran nasaru) following a gerund, means that an 
action is to be attempted ; there is a doubt as to whether the action can be 
accomplished or whether the result will be satisfactory : 

Mado u-o akete mimasho may mean, ' I will try to open the window (which 
has stuck)' or 'I will open the window and we will see whether i* is more agree- 
able so'. 

105. The verb okti following a gerund indicates the full and complete s 

of a matter for the time being with a view to its future use ; it is used generally 



28 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



with transitive verbs : the gerund and oku are sometimes contracted colloquially 
as explained, 14, 2, c. 

Chomen ni tsukete okimasho ; I will put it down in my note-book. 

106. The verb shimau following a gerund indicates the completion of an 
action, or is merely emphatic : 

lite shimaimashita ; he has gone away (and will not come back). 

Toto bydki ni natte shimaimashUa ; 'at last he finished by falling ill', or 
' at last he fell ill ', not ' at last he has finished being ill '. 

The last syllable of the gerund and the first two syllables of shimau are often 
contracted colloquially as explained, 14, 2, f. 

1 07. The verb sum (or itasu) following the stem of a verb and zta, is merely 
an emphatic form of expression. See 4749. 

The verbs naosu, dasu, kakaru, kake'ru and hanasu after the stems of verbs 
have special meanings which are explained in 1 51 . 

108. The verb morau (or itadaku) following a gerund, adds the idea of 're- 
ceiving in answer to a request', and forms an idiom resembling the passive or 
the causative : 

Shimbun wo yonde morau ; to have the newspaper read to one. 
Asa hayaku okoshlte moraitai ; I wish to be called early in the morning. 
Tokei tco soji shite moraitai ; I want to have my watch cleaned. 
Anata ni kaite itadakitai ; I wish you would write this for me. 

109. The verb yarn, (age'ru, kure'ru or kudasaru*) following a gerund adds 
the idea of 'giving'. The choice of the verb will depend on the considerations 
governing the use of honorific and humble verbs. If the giving is the act of 
the 1st person to an inferior, use yarn ; to a superior, use age'ru : if the giving 
is in favour of the 1st person or somebody connected with the 1st person, use 
kure'ni if the act of an inferior, kudasaru if the act of a superior. 

Butte yarimasho ; I will give him a beating. 
Yonde agemasho ka ? shall I read it to you ? 
Yonde kudasaimashlta ; he read it to me. 

110. Terminal verbs sometimes retain their ordinary meanings instead of 
the special meanings mentioned in the above paragraphs. 

Kind Taro no gakko e itte mimashita ; yesterday I went and saw Taro's school. 

It thus happens that sentences of this kind may have more than one meaning : 
katte itadaita may mean, (a) he bought it and gave it to me, or (b) he bought it 
for me (as I was busy and could not go out) ; in this latter case, the favour 
received is not the thing itself (for which I pay) but the act of going and buying it. 

You may s<jmetimes find two terminal verbs used, the one affecting the other : 
naoshite agete okimasho I shall mend it for him (and leave that settled). 

*Kudaoaru is also used after the stem of a verb ; see 362. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 29 

TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VERBS. 

V 

111. In English the same verb is often transitive or intransitive according 
to circumstances ; in Japanese there are generally two different verbs with a 
common root ; e.g. kaesu (trans.) and kaeru (intrans.), to return.* 

Ashita hon zco kaeshimasu ; I will return the book tomorrow. 
Kesa kaerimasMta ; I returned this morning. 

112. The gerund of the intransitive verb followed by i'ru has a meaning very 
similar to the gerund of the corresponding transitive verb followed by aru ; 
see 1 01 . 

113. Many intransitive verbs are used as potentials : especially those in 
which the final u of the transitive is replaced by e'ru in the intransitive. See 
127. 

Kono empitsu wa yoku kakemasu ; 'this pencil writes well', or 'you can 
write well with this pencil'. 

Xihon-ji ga kakemasen ; I cannot write Japanese characters. 

114. Many intransitive verbs are inchoative, i.e. they mark the beginning 
of a condition. Some of these are frequently translated by a quasi-passive but 
their primary meaning should.not be lost sight of. Thus : 

Kazvaku is not properly 'to be dry', but 'to get dry'. 'To be dry' is ex- 
pressed by kazvaite i'ru. 

Kutabire'ru is not properly 'to be tired', but 'to become tired'. 'To be 
tired' is expressed by kutabirete i'ru. 

115. These verbs are often used in the past in Japanese when we, in English, 
employ the present ; kawakimashita it is dry ; kutabiremasMta I am tired. 

116. Transitive verbs sometimes have a quasi -causative meaning: kazca- 
kasu 'to dry' i.e. 'to cause to dry in the sun or before the fire, etc.' See 143 
144. 

117. Though it may seem paradoxical, some intransitive verbs take an 
object with the postposition zco. This complement with zvo designates the 
locality at which or from which the action takes place. Watasu means 'to 
take (something) across' and is therefore transitive; zeataru means 'to go 
across oneself and is therefore intransitive ; kazca wo zcataru means 'to go 
across the river' or 'to cross the river'. Likewise: kisha zco ori'ni, to get 
down from a train. 

118. Some Japanese intransitive verbs correspond to English reflexives: 
asobu to amuse oneself, (to play) ; hataraku to exert oneself, (to work). 



*The Vocabulary at the end of this book gives the transitive verb corresponding to an 
intransitive one and vice versa. 



30 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



PASSIVE VERBS. 

119. The passive voice is formed by adding re'ru to the 4th base In 
verbs ending in e'ru or i'ru, add rare'ru to the 4th base. E.g.: korosti to 
kill, 4th base korosa, korosare'ru to be killed ; tabe'ru to eat, 4th base 
lobe, taberare'ru to be eaten. 

120. The verbs sum, kuru and oshie'ru form the passive irregularly ; thus : 
sare'ru, korare'ru and osowaru. 

1 21 . The passives of compound verbs and of such combinations as motte 
kuru to bring, are formed by changing only the last component. Thus : motte 
korare'ru to be brought. 

122. The noun, which in English takes the preposition 'by' in the passive 
construction, is generally followed in the Japanese passive by the postposition 
ni. 

123. It often happens that the English passive is not translated by the passive 
in Japanese ; it is sometimes translated : 

1) by an intransitive or potential verb : odoroita, I was astonished ; nezumi 
ga toreta, a mouse is caught (in the trap).* 

2) by a transitive verb followed by mono (de$u) or no (desu) : Kore wa ko- 
gatana de kitta no (desu) ka ? hasami de kitta no (desu) ka ? was this cut with 
a knife, or with scissors ? 

3) by an active though subjectless construction : Risuke to iu hito ; a man 
called Risuke. (lit. a man they call Risuke). M ado kara kao ivo dasa-nai yd ni 
negaimasu ; you are requested not to put your head out of the window. 
Kono kutsu wo naoshi ni yarimasho ; I'll send these boots to be mended. 

4) by the gerund of an active verb followed by aru : Kaite aru ; it is written. 

5) by the gerund of an active verb followed by morau : Hayaku okoslilte 
moraitai ; I wish to be called early. 

6) by the gerund of an intransitive verb followed by i'ru (or oru) : To ga 
shimatte iru ; the door is shut. 

7) by a noun followed by ni naru : O sewa ni naru ; to be assisted. 

8) by the verb deki'ru ; to be finished, made : Asuko de setomono ga dekiru ; 
porcelain is manufactured there. 

Note also the following examples : 
Kega suru ; to be wounded. 

Kono ji wa to yomasemasu ; this character is read thus (lit. we are caused 
or taught to read this chacracter thus ). 

All the above examples serve to prove that the English passive is often 

*You can also say : nezumi ga neko ni torarcta, a mouse was caught by the cat. The 
intransitive construction is used when there is no reference to an outside agent, (the mouse 
caught itself in the trap) ; the passive construction, when an outside agent is referred to. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 31 

translated into Japanese by other constructions than the passive. On the 
other hand the Japanese often use the passive where the active would be 
more natural in English. 

So sum to o kd-san ni shtkarareru ; if you do that your mother will scold you. 

124. The Japanese passive construction differs considerably from the Eng- 
lish. In English, the subject of the passive verb is the object of the transitive 
verb ; in Japanese, the subject of the passive verb is the person affected by the 
action of the verb. Thus, ' a thief stole my father's watch' becomes in the 
English passive construction 'my father's watch was stolen by a thief; in 
Japanese we would have 'my father got his watch stolen by a thief chichi ga 
dorobo ni tokei wo nusumareta. From this peculiarity of the Japanese construc- 
tion it follows that (as in the above example) the passive verb may govern an 
objective case ; it also follows that intransitive verbs may be used in the pas- 
sive. ' To die ' is an intransitive verb and utterly incapable of being used in 
the passive in English : however, the dying of one person may affect another, 
and therefore we may have the passive construction in Japanese, watakushi 
wa kyonen kanai ni shinaremashita ; I lost my wife last year. 

125. Besides this sense, the Japanese passive has often a potential meaning ; 
see 126. 

POTENTIAL VERBS. 

126. The Japanese passive is often used in a potential sense. Thus okare'ru 
may rrfean either 'to be put' or 'to be able to put'. 

127. Many verbs (not those ending in e'ru) have also another potential 
formed by changing the final u into e'ru* This potential is always intransitive 
and is often identical with the ordinary intransitive verb (111), as in the follow- 
ing common cases : 

kake'ru 'to write (intr.)' or 'to be able to write'. 
kire'ru 'to cut (intr.)' or 'to be able to cut'. 
toke'ru 'to melt (intr.)' or 'to be able to melt'. 
tore'ru 'to take (intr.)' or 'to be able to take'. 
ure'ru 'to sell (intr.)' or 'to be able to sell'. 
yome'ru 'to read (intr.)' or 'to be able to read'. 

128. Thus, kinu ga yoku uremasu may be translated by the intransitive, 
'silk sells well'; or by the potential, 'you can sell a lot of silk'; it may also 
be translated by the passive, 'a lot of silk is sold'. All three translations are 
not always possible in English, sometimes one, sometimes another will suit the 
case ; but do not forget that verbs of this kind are intransitive in Japanese. 

*Verbs ending in -tnu, change tsu into te-rv. 



82 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



129. When the English potential has an objective case, this generally becomes 
the subject with ga (or tea) of the Japanese verb. 

Ei-go ga yomemasu ; I can read English. 

The English subject sometimes takes ni. 

Watashi ni wa Ei-go ga yomemasen ; I can 't read English. 

130. The potential may also be expressed by adding koto ga deki'ru to the 
infinitive.* 

1 31 . We thus see that kake'ru, kakare'ru and kaku koto ga deki'ru may all be 
used as the potential of kaku. There seems to be a slight tendency to prefer 
the intransitive potential in the sense of 'can', and the passive potential in 
the sense of ' may '. On the whole, the intransitive potential is decidedly the 
most used. 

132. The verbs mi'ru to see, and kiku to hear, form the intransitive potential 
irregularly, viz. mie'ru and kikoe'ru. 

1 33. Deki'ru by itself often has the meaning of ' can do (something) '. 
Kore ga dekimasu ka ? can you do this ? 

Ei-go ga dekimasu ; I can speak English. 

Dekiru koto nara ; if it is anything I can do ; (when asked : will you do me 
a favour ?) 

134. The word totemo is frequently placed before the negative potential in 
order to emphasize it. 

Totemo kore hodo wa kake-nai ; I cannot possibly write all this. 

135. The negative potential when "used in a moral and not in a physical 
sense is sometimes translated by wake ni wa ika-nai (or mairimasen) : 

Isogashii kara so hayaku iku wake ni wa ika-nai ; as I am busy I cannot 
possibly go so soon. 

136. The following emphatic construction is interesting : 

Yomeru ni wa yomeru ga . . . ; I can read it but ... (it is extremely difficult). 
Other ways of translating the idea of moral ability or inability, ' may ' and 
'must not', will be found in 168 and 169. 

CAUSATIVE VERBS. 

1 37. Causative verbs are formed by adding se'ru to the 4th base ; in verbs 
ending in e'ru or i'ru add sase'ru to the 4th base : yamu to read, 4th base yoma, 
yomase'ru to cause to read ; tabe'ru to eat, 4th base tabe, tabesase'ru to cause to 
eat, i.e. to feed. 

138. Causative verbs generally form their 3rd base irregularly as mentioned 
in 97. 

"This construction seems to be less used by the Japanese themselves than by foreigners 
who are beginning to speak a little Japanese. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 33 

jf 

139. The verbs kuru, sum and mi'ru form their causatives irregularly, thus : 
liosase'ru, sase'ru and mise'ru (3rd base regular, miset). 

140. Some causatives may be translated by special verbs in English. 
mi'ru to see ; mise'ru to cause to see. i.e. to show. 

kiku to hear ; kikase'm to cause to hear, i.e. to tell. 
shim to know ; shirase'ru to cause to know, i.e. to inform. 
tabc'ru to eat ; tabesase'ru to cause to eat, i.e. to feed. 

1 41 . The fundamental idea of the causative is that the action is done by one 
person (or thing), but another person decides whether the action is to be done 
or not. The causative may have two meanings : (a) to cause to do ; and (b) to 
allow something to be done : the latter meaning is especially common in the 
negative imperative. The causative may generally be translated by make, 
let, have, get or tell. 

Sukoshi matashite o oki nasai ; make him wait a moment. 

Kondo Hani ni nuzvase nasai : let Hani sew it next time. 

Watakushi no hon zco kodomo ni ijirasete zva ike-nai; don't let the child meddle 
with my books. 

HUotsu koshiraesashlte ; have one made. 

Kono hako zva doko de koshiraesasemasMta ka ? where did you get this box 
made ? 

Shige ni kakase nasai ; tell Shige to write it. 

142. The cr.usative is sometimes used in Japanese, when the causation is 
purely imaginary. 

Ashlta furasetaku nai ; I hope it will not rain tomorrow, (lit. I do not wish 
to make it rain tomorrow). 

Kane ga nai no de naoru byo-nin zvo naosa-nai deshinashlte shimatta ; he had to 
let the patient die because he had no money to buy the proper remedies, 
(shinase'ru to cause to die). 

Sentaku wo sumasete uchi e kaerimashita ; she finished her washing and re- 
turned home. 

143. Sometimes when the idea logically corresponds to a causative, an ordi- 
nary transitive verb is used : the action of the subordinate is attributed to the 
principal agent, or an action which is merely allowed to happen is considered 
as having been positively perform ?d. 

Uchi wo tate'ru ; to build a house ; meaning 'to have a house built'. 
Hige wo sum ; to shave one's beard ; meaning 'to get one's beard shaved'. 
Inu wo dashite o kure ; put the dog out ; meaning 'let the dog go out'. 
Neko wo mono-oki ni irete o kure ; put the eat in the pantry; meaning 'let 
the cat get into the pantry '. 

Hi ico kesa-nai de o kure ; don't put the fire out ; meaning 'don't let the fire 

go out'. 



34 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



144. Some transitive verbs have a quasi-causative meaning. Thus, hire 
wo kawakasu, 'to dry a cloth' really means, 'to cause the sun, (fire or wind, 
etc.) to dry the cloth'. 

145. In the case of the causative of a transitive verb, the person to do the 
action takes the postposition ni, the object upon which the action is performed 
takes wo. Mon wo daiku ni naosasemasho ; I will have the carpenter mend 
the gate. 

In the case of an intransitive verb, the person who performs the action takes 
the postposition wo. O kd-san wo nakasemashita ; he made his mother cry. 

146. The idea of the causative is sometimes rendered politely by the gerund 
followed by morau : 

Tokei wo naoshite moraitai ; I want to get my watch mended. 

147. From the causative is formed the passive of the causative, rarely met 
with. There is no causative of the passive. 

148. The causatives of compound verbs and of such combinations as motte 
kuru to bring, are formed by changing only the last component : motte kosase'm, 
to cause to bring. 

REFLEXIVE VERBS. 

149. There are no reflexive verbs in Japanese. English reflexives are trans- 
lated : 

1) sometimes by intransitives : asobu, to amuse oneself, (to play). 

2) sometimes by compounds with sum : shitaku sum, to prepare oneself, 
(to get ready). 

3) sometmes, when there is a clear action of the agent on himself, by a transi- 
tive verb : hige wo suru, to shave oneself ; mi wo nage'ru, to drown oneself. 

150. When it is desired to lay stress on the 'self, the Japanese add hitori 
de or jibun de : 

Kodomo ga hitori de asonde iru ; the child is amusing himself, (i.e. playing 
alone). 

Jibun de hige wo surimasu ; he shaves himself, (i.e. not shaved by another). 

COMPOUND AND DERIVATIVE VERBS. 

151. A very large group of compound verbs is formed by adding one verb 
to the stc-m of another. They correspond sometimes to English prepositional 
verbs, or serve to express a more or less complex idea. The meaning of these 
verbs is generally easily understood, if the meanings of the components are 
known. 

tobi-agaru, to jump up, (lit. jump-ascend). 
tobi-dasu, to jump out, (lit. jump-put out). 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 35 

tobi-komu, to jump in, (lit. jump-enter). 
mi-otosu, to overlook, (lit. look-drop). 
buchi-korosu, to beat to death, (lit. beat-kill). 
slvi-naosu, to do over again, (lit. do-mend). 

152. Some verbs when used thus in compounds after the stem of a verb have 
special meanings worth while noticing : 

Dasti means to take out or refers to the beginning of an action : tobi-dasu 
to jump out ; furi-dasu, to start raining. 

Hanasu suffers certain euphonic changes and becomes -ppanasu ; it denotes 
that something has been left in a certain state : akeppanasu, to leave open ; 
dafihlppanasu, to take a thing out and leave it out. 

Kakaru shows that an action is about to commence or else that it is accident- 
al : kare-kakaru, to begin to wither ; Wri-kakaru, to happen to pass. 

Kake'ru signifies the beginning of an action : hanashi-kake'ru to address, 
accost ; yomi-kake'ru, to begin to read. 

Naosu means to do over again by way of bettering or correcting : kaki-naosu 
to write over again ; kangae-naosu, to change one 's mind. 

153. Compound verbs are also formed by a noun and a verb ; e.g.: koshi- 
kake'ru, to sit, (lit. loins, hang). 

Instead of a noun we may have the stem of an adjective, which is often used 
as a noun, and a verb ; e.g.: ama-sugi'ru, to be too sweet, (amai sweet, sugi'ru 
to exceed). 

154. The termination garu added to the stem of adjectives (or the desidera- 
tive form of verbs) or occasionally to nouns, forms a considerable nu nber of 
verbs : 

kawaigaru to pet, from kawaii charming. 
ikitagaru to want to go, from ikitai wishing to go. 
kinodokugaru to feel sorry for, from kinodoku sorrow. 

155. The compounds of sum are explained in the next paragraph. 

THE VERBS SuTU AND NarU. 

156. The verb sum occurs very frequently in Japanese. The primary mean- 
ing of sum is 'to do' 'to make' ; it governs the accusative case with the post- 
position wo : 

Shitaku wo suru ; to make preparations. 

Jama wo suru ; to make obstruction, i.e. to be in the way. 

157. This accusative may be modified by an adjective or by a clause. 
Anata no jama wo suru ; to be in your way. 

158. The postposition zco is very frequently omitted, and suru then becomes 
hardly more than a suffix serving to verbalize the noun. The combination 



36 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



thus formed may be transitive (with an accusative and wo), intransitive or 
passive. 

Jochu ico seica sum ; to procure a servant (for another). 

Shit sure i sum ; to be impolite. 

Kega sum ; to be wounded. 

159. Instead of a noun before sum, we may have the second base of a verb 
(which often acts as a noun), or an adverb. 

Nui wo sum ; to embroider. 
Bikkuri sum ; to be astonished. 

160. Compounds of sum, whether written in one word or two,* are conjugated 
like sum. However, not all verbs that end in sum are compounds of sum : 
thus : sassuru is a compound of sum and makes sasshimasu, etc.; kosuru is not 
a compound of sum and makes kosurimasu, etc. 

The final ru of suru is sometimes dropped in compounds ; thus : nakufiuru or 
nakusii to lose, yakusuru or yakusu to translate. 

161. Sometimes suru when used independently resembles aru in construction 
and. meaning ; it takes ga instead of wo, and means 'to be' or 'to have' : 

Nioi ga suru ; there is a smell. 
Zutsu ga suru ; I have a headache. 

162. A. very common construction is the following. The second base of a 
verb, wa, and the verb suru. See 47 49. For other uses of suru, see the 
Vocabulary, Part III. 

163. The humble verb itasu may be substituted for suru in practically all 
cases in which suru is written as a separate word ; the corresponding honorific 
verb is nasaru.* 

164. Naru 'to become' may be considered the type of an inchoative verb 
(114). It is generally used after an adverb or an adverbial construction, and 
some of the combinations deserve special attention. Note in particular its use 
after the desiderative verbal adjective and after the negative verbal adjective. 
The past tense of naru may be translated into English by either the past or the 
present ; the context will indicate which is to be used. 

Atsuku natta ; (after being cold) it turned out hot (yesterday) ; it has turned 
out hot (today) ; it is hot now. 

Atsuku naru desho ; I expect it will turn out hot. 

Ikitaku natta ; I now wish to go (formerly I didn't care about going). 

Sono koto ga deki-naku natta ; it is now impossible. 

The use of nara-nai after the negative conditional has already been mentioned 
(72) ; for other uses of naru see the Vocabulary, Part III. 



*It is usual to attach mini to the preceding word when this consists of only one 
character ; as jikttsuru, nakusuru. In this case suru cannot be replaced by the polite verb- 
naaaru or the humble verb itasu. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 37 

THE VERB 'TO BE 5 . 

165. The verb 'to be' is translated in various ways : 

1) When a noun is predicate, 'to be' is translated by de aru, etc.. the con- 
tractions da, desiiy etc. (94), or the more polite de gozaim-asu. etc. 

It was a lie ; uso deshita. 
What is this ? kore wo, nan da ? 

2) Aru means properly 'there is', etc.; it is always used when referring to 
inanimate objects, it is also used when the simple existence of a living being is 
spoken of, or when we wish to pick out from a group one or more individuals 
who possess a certain quality. 

Is there any bread ? pan ga arimasu ka ? 

There are some cats without tails ; shippo no nai neko ga aru. 

There are two carpenters among these men ; kono uclii ni daiku gafutari aru. 

When aru is used attributively, it still has this meaning of 'there is', or 'there 
was'; it can often be translated by 'a certain': aru hlto, a certain man, (there 
was a man) ; am hi, a certain day. one day ; (there was a day). 

8) Gozaru takes the place of am in polite speech ; it is not used attributively 
in the sense of 'a certain'. 

4) I'm (less commonly oru) is used when speaking of animate beings that are 
present in a place ; they are generally conceived, at least vaguely, as having 
gone or come there.* 

There are many flies in Yokohama ; Yokohama ni hai ga takusan imasu. 

5) The verb 'to be' followed by the participle signifies a continued act 
or state, it is translated by the gerund followed by i'ru (or oru). See 35. 

6) Irassharu and o-ide nasaru are polite substitutes for i'ru. 

7) The translation of the passive 'to be' is shown in 98-101 ; 119-124; 128. 

8) When the Japanese predicate is a true adjective (191), the verb 'to be' 
need not be translated. 

That flower is red ; ano liana tea akai. 

9) Sum though properly 'to do' has sometimes the meaning of 'to be'. 
(See 161). 

10) Occasionally 'to be' has a meaning of 'to become' and is translated 
by naru : 

I don 't think it will be much of a fire ; oki na kaji ni wd nara-nai desho. 
I am going to be a doctor ; isha ni naru tsumori desu. 

*Things like a rikisha, a carriage, a train, a ship, the sun, the' moon, etc. that appear to 
have proper motion, are often treated like living beings and are construed with the verb 
i'ru instead of aru. 

The other rikisha is a long way behind ; mo ichi-dai no kuruma wa zullo ato ni imatu. 

The moon is behind the pine-tree ; tsuki ga matsu no kage ni iru. 



38 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



11) 'Isn't ?' expecting 'yes ' for an answer, is often translated by de wa 
arimasen ka ? placed at the end of the sentence : 

Isn 't the doctor ill ? o isha son wa bydki ja arimasen ka ? 



MISCELLANEOUS TRANSLATIONS. 

166. Doubt, probability, possibility, ' perhaps', supposition, opinion, sem- 
blance, report. 

1 ) Bare possibility with practical certainty of the contrary : 

There may be a house to let hi Kamakura (but I feel nearly certain there 
isn't) ; Kamakura ni kashi-ya ga nai to mo ie-nai keredo ; (lit. I can't say there 
is not a house to let in Kama kura, nevertheless . . . ).

168. Obligation. 

1) Obligation to do something is expressed by :

3) Obligation to prevent something from happening is translated by : 

a) The negative verb, yd ni, and the imperative of suru : 
Don 't let the fire go out ; hi ga kie-nai yd ni shi nasai. 

b) By a causative or quasi-causative construction, 141 et seqq. 

Don't let the child meddle with my books ; watakushi no hon wo kodomo ni 
ijirashite wa ike-nai ; (lit. don 't cause the child to touch my books). 

Don 't let the fire go out ; hi wo kesa-nai de o kure ; (lit. don 't put the fire out). 

*Nara-nai is used in the case of merely pointing out or stating an obligation ; ike-nai 
when the sentence partakes of the nature of a command, a scolding, a threat or a warning 
that something disagreeable will happen unless a certain act is performed. In a general way, 
nara-nai is commoner in the 1st person and ike-nai in the 2nd. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 41 

Don't let any dogs get in ; inu wo irete wa ike-nai ; (lit. don't introduce any 
dogs).

lated by a causative or quasi-causative construction; see 141 et seqq.; 168, 
3, b. 

4) The indicating of a wish is often equivalent, in Japanese as in English, to 
asking permission : 

Futsuka no hima wo itadakito gozaimasti, ; I would like to have two days ' 
leave . 

5) Permission is occasionally expressed by the potential ; see 126 et seqq. 

170. Advice, preference, judging of two lines of action. 

1) Asking for advice is translated by the past conditional and ii daro (or 
desho) : 

Which road shall I take ? dono michi wo ittara ii desho ? 

Asking about preference may be translated as follows : 

Mizu to o yu to dotchi ga yd gozaimasu ka ? which do you want, hot or cold 
water ? 

Hosoi no to fiitoi no to dotchi ga hoshii no desu ? do you want a thin one or a 
thick one ? 

2) Giving advice : 

a) The conditional (or first forms of the present and to) followed by ii ; or 
the present or past of the verb or the adjective, and ho ga ii ; this savours of a 
command : 

You had better take an umbrella ; kasa wo motte ikeba ii ; kasa wo motte iku 
to ii ; kasa wo motte iku ho ga ii.

under (a) : 



42 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Perhaps it would be better to take an umbrella ; kasa zco motte iku ho ga ii 
desho. 

d) In the above cases we have always had the idea of 'better'; other ad- 
jectives have similar constructions : 

Perhaps it would be shorter to go straight on ; massugu no ho ga chikai 
desho. 

e) Advice disguised as a polite suggestion may be given by the past con- 
ditional followed by ikaga desu ka ? or do desu ka ? 

Would you care to take an umbrella ? kasa wo motte ittara ikaga desu ka ? 

3) Approval of past line of conduct is expressed by the gerund followed by 
yokatta : 

It was a good thing you took an umbrella ; kasa wo motte itte yokatta. 
It was a good thing you didn 't take an umbrella ; kasa wo motte ika-nai de 
yokatta. 

4) Disapproval of past line of conduct is rendered, besides other possible 
ways, by any of the following combinations, which are often but not always 
used elliptically :

The present conditional ) and ( yokatta daro (ni) 
The present, to { ii no ni 

You ought to have taken an umbrella ; kasa wo motte iku ho ga yokatta.

d) Some form of the future in desho (or daro) : 

I hope you will soon be better ; jiki yoku o nan desho. 

2) Desire coupled with doubt, fear or regret is translated by the present con- 
ditional, or present and to. followed by ii (or yokatta for the past). Doubt is 
emphasized by adding ga or keredomo ; regret by adding no ni : 

I wish it wasn't raining ; ame ga fura-nakereba ii no ni. 

8) Desire in the sense of 'would like to have', is translated by hoshii : 

Taro wants a pear ; Taro wa nashi ga hoshii.

Shall we go for a walk ? sampo ni ikimasho ka ? 

172. Fear. 

1) In the sense of real fear, it is generally translated by means of the adjec- 
tive kowai or the verb koicagaru : 

Are you afraid ? kowai no desu ka ? 

2) In the sense of anxiety that something disagreeable has happened or will 
happen, by : 

a) Shimpai suru or shimpai da : 

I am afraid of dirtying my dress ; kimono wo yogosu no ga shimpai desu. 

b) An elliptical construction consisting of the negative present conditional 
followed by ii ga :

173. Intention may be expressed in two ways between which there seems 
no practical difference : 



44 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



1) The first form of the present followed by tsumori : 
I intend to go to Tokyo ; Tokyo e iku tsumori desu. 

2) The future followed by to omou : 

I intend to go to Tokyo ; Tokyo e iko to omoimasu.

kaiva ivo muko to shite itara kodomo ga butsukatta no desu. 
I am about to start ; dekakeru tokoro desu. 



CHAPTER III. 



NOUNS. 



ARTICLE. 

174. The Japanese noun is preceded by nothing that corresponds to an 
article. It has in itself no gender or number ; and these circumstances are 
generally entirely ignored in speaking. 

175. The English article is sometimes translated : 

1) When 'a' means 'one', it is translated by the equivalent of 'one'. Please 
give me a pear ; nashi wo hltotsu kudasai. 

2) When 'a' means 'each', it is sometimes translated by ni or de. Four 
times a month ; tsuki (ni) yo-tabi : how much a foot ? shaku (dc) ikura ? 

3) When 'a' or 'the' refers to a whole class, the phrase to hi mono is some- 
times placed after the noun. The dog (or a dog) is a clever animal ; inu to iu 
mono wa riko na mono da ; but we could also say : inu wa riko nn mono da. 

4) The difference like that between 'a' and 'the' may sometimes be expressed 
by the correct use of zva and ga ; see 392. 

5) 'The the' e.g. 'the sooner the better' is translated by hodo : see 259. 

GENDER. 

176. Gender is to be found in some nouns that refer to relationship or to the 
occupations of men and women. E.g.: chichi, father ; oba, aunt ; genan, male 
servant ; geisha, singing girl. 

177. In other rare cases, when it is necessary to call attention to the sex of an 
animal it may be done : 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN* LANGUAGE 45 

1 ) By prefixing o (or on) for the male, and me (or men) for the female ; thus, 
o-ushi, bull, ox ; me-ushi, cow ; midori, cock ; men-dori, hen. All names of 
animals are not capable of receiving these prefixes. 

2) By prefixing otoko no for the male, or onna no for the female. 

NUMBER. 

1 78. A Japanese noun of itself is either singular or plural according to cir- 
cumstances. The idea of plurality may be expressed, though it is rarely 
necessary to do so, by adding the suffixes -domo, -tachi or -gata ; the last of 
these is more polite. 

179. The words kodomo and tomodachi were originally plural, but they have 
lost the special idea of plurality and like any other Japanese noun may be used 
indifferently in singular or plural. Kodomo-tachi may be used for the plural of 
kodomo ; tomodachi has no special plural. 

180. The idea of plurality is sometimes expressed by doubling the word, 
thus : hobo everywhere, from ho a side ; kuni-guni various countries, from kuni 
country. 

DERIVATIVE AND COMPOUND CONCRETE NOUNS. 

1 81 . Many concrete nouns are derivatives or compounds : 

1) The stem of a verb is very frequently used as a noun : hanashi a conversa- 
tion, from hanasu to speak. 

2) Compound nouns are formed of two nouns : te-bukuro gloves, from ie hand, 
and fukuro bag : tsuki-hi months and days, time. 

3) Occasionally the words are abbreviated before forming the compound : 
sak-kon, yesterday and today, i.e. recently, from sakujitsu and konnichi. 

4) The stems of two verbs : Mkidashi a drawer, from hiku to pull, and dasti 
to take out. 

5) Noun and stem of verb or vice versa : mado-kake a curtain, from mado a 
window, and kake'ru to hang ; tatami-isu a folding chair, from tafamu to fold 
and isu a chair. 

6) Stem of adjective and noun : aka-gane copper, from akai red, and kOM 

metal. 

7) Stem of adjective and stem of verb : niga-u-arai a sneer, from nigai b 

and warau to laugh. 

8) The suffix - V a a house, added to a noun serves to form a large number of 
compounds that mean the names of shops, and secondarily, tradesmen. HJ 
suri-ya, from ktisuri medicine, means a chemist 's shop or the chemist. 

want to show clearly we are speaking of the man and not of the shop, we 



46 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



add San Mr. Some of these compounds in ya refer only to the person : kuruma- 
ya a rikisha-man. 

9) Words like -jin man. -go language, -kawa river, -shima island, and many 
others are added to nouns to form compounds : Igirisu-jin an Englishman ; 
Furansu-go the French language. 

10) The particle no placed after an adjective is equivalent to a noun with 
the meaning of 'one': chiisai no a small one ; akai no the red one. See 188. 

11) The word mono thing or person, used as a suffix serves to form a very 
large number of compounds : 

a) It may be added to the stem of a verb : kimono a dress, from ki'ru to 
put on. 

b) An adjective stem : aomono vegetables, from aoi green. 

c) A noun : inaka-mono a rustic, from inaka the country. 

d) Compounds in mono often have a special meaning as explained, 1 9. 

e) Mono is often contracted to mow', no, or even n\ 

12) The adverbial form of certain adjectives is sometimes used as a noun : 
hayaku kara osoku made from early morning until late at night ; suteishon no 
chikaku ga ii (a house in) the neighbourhood of the station would be preferable. 

13) A great many Japanese nouns are merely mispronounced European 
words, especially English. 



DERIVATIVE AND COMPOUND ABSTRACT NOUNS. 

182. Abstract nouns are formed in various ways : 

1) The stem of adjectives : oka scarlet (noun), from akai scarlet (adjective). 
Kono moyo u-a aka ga katte iru ; there is too much scarlet in this pattern. 

2) The stem of an adjective to which -sa is added : nagasa length, from nagai 
long. These nouns refer to the degree of a quality. 

Occasionally the noun part of quasi-adjectives in na is used in this same way ; 
jobuia strength, from jobu na strong. 

3) The termination -mi added to the stem of an adjective, forms nouns that 
mean a tinge of a quality, or sometimes the quality itself : akami a tinge of 
red ; amami sweetness. 

4) Two words (verbs, adjectives or nouns) meaning opposite things : aru- 
nashi is-isn't, i.e. the question of the existence of a thing ; suki-kirai the ques- 
tion of liking or disliking. 

5) An adjective followed by the postposition no is sometimes equivalent to 
an abstract noun : Samui no tea ii ga atsui no ni wa komarimasu ; I don 't mind 
the cold, but I find the heat very trying. Takai no ni iva odoroita ; I was 
astonished at the dearness of it. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 47 

6) Adjectives not followed by no are occasionally used as abstract nouns . 
207. 

7) The stem of verbs : itami pain, from itamu to ache. 

8) An adjective followed by koto : hayai koto velocity, from hayai rapid; 
This form is used as an exclamation : hayai koto ! what velocity ! It is also 
often used when we deny the existence of a quality : It is not dear ; takai 
koto tua nai, (lit. there is no dearness). 

183. Mono and koto both mean 'thing'; but koto always denotes an abstract 
idea, a fact, an act, etc., while mono generally refers to something concrete and 
tangible. Thus onaji mono means 'the same thing' 'the identical article', 
whereas o-naji koto means 'the same sort of thing' 'something equivalent'. 
If somebody complains that he was given two five-sen stamps instead of one 
ten-sen one, we might say : onaji koto ja arimasen ka ? ' well, isn 't it the same 
thing ?' Speaking of a picture or a book, etc., we might call it omoshiroi mono 
an amusing thing ; but we would say ryoko sum hodo omoshiroi koto wa nai, 
there is nothing more amusing than travelling. 

DIMINUTIVES AND AUGMENTATIVES. 

184. Diminutives are often formed by prefixing ko child or small. Ko- 
gatana a penknife, from katana a sword ; ko-ishi a pebble, from ishi a stone. 

185. Ko is sometimes used as a prefix to form the names of the young of 
animals, but all animals cannot take ko as a prefix while they can all be followed 
by 710 ko with the same meaning : we may say, ko-inu or inu no ko a puppy ; 
but speaking of the young of a fly we cannot say ko-hai. but only hai no ko. 

186. Augmentatives are sometimes formed by prefixing 6 big, less frequently 
dai (or tai) : d-kaze a gale, from kaze wind ; daiji importance, from ji thing. 



CHAPTER IV. 



ADJECTIVES. 



17. Japanese adjectives have no gender, number or case. 

Muny adjectives are used in two senses : they may refer to the objective 
quality of a thing or to the subjective feeling of a person. Oishii kudamono 
nice fruit ; anata no kudas'tta kudamono wo oishlku iabemashlta ; I ate with pleas- 
an I feelings the fruit you kindly gave me. Likewise : omoshiroi koto an 



48 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



amusing thing (i.e. a thing which produces amusement), and omoshirokatta I was 
amused ; arigatai koto a thing to be grateful for (i.e. which 'ought to produce 
gratitude), and arigatai I am grateful. 

188. Any adjective may be given the force of a noun by adding the particle 
no which then has the meaning of 'one'. From chiisai small, we have chiisai 
no a small one ; from kirei na pretty, we have kirei na no a pretty one. How- 
ever, if the adjective ends in no. another no is not added : hoka no ano'hsr, 
hoka no another one. Two 770 may sometimes follow each other when the first 
one means 'one' and the second 'of: chiisai no no hanashi desu ; we are talking 
of the small one. 

A similar construction of no is found after verbs used attributively (233) ; 
mita no the one I saw. 

No is also used in an inverted construction not infrequently heard. Kitte 
no furui no (lit. old ones of postage stamps) is about equivalent tofurui kitte 
old postage stamps. There is a slight difference between these two expressions 
more easily felt than defined ; the difference is something like that which exists 
between ' postage stamps, old ones ' and ' old postage stamps '. Likewise neko 
no shinda no and shinda neko both mean a dead cat. 

1 89. The joining of two or more adjectives will be treated later on (406), but 
we will remark here that Japanese adjectives, like the English, may sometimes 
folJow each other without any conjunction or special construction : Ano zcakai 
kirei na Into ; that handsome young man, (lit. that young handsome man). 

190. An adjective may be used in four ways : 

1) As an attributive, in which case it is placed before the noun : takai uchi 
a high house. 

2) As a predicate in ordinary sentences : kono uchi wa takai ; this house is high. 

3) As a .predicate in polite sentences with the verb gozaru : kono uchi zca tako 
gozaimasu ; this house is high. 

4) As an adverb, when it may refer either, ) to the verb itself : hayaku 
arukimasu he walks quickly ; yoku mieru I can see it well ; or b) to a noun 
through the verb : ano uchi zva okiku mieru that house looks big ; kire zvo akaku, 
somemasu I will dye the cloth red. In English, case a) is generally translated 
by an adverb (as : quickly, well), and b) by an adjective (as : big, red) ; indeed 
case b) might often be considered and called a predicate. But the two cases a) 
and b), though logically distinct, are included here under one heading as they 
correspond to one and the same form in Japanese, not only in the case of true 
adjectives but also in the case of quasi-adjectives in na or no, and adjectival 
phrases like ki no hayai impulsive. 

191. There are various classes of adjectives : 

1 ) True adjectives, these always end in ai, ii, oi or ui. 

2) Quasi-adjectives formed by adding na or no to nouns, etc. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 49 

3) Adjectival phrases composed of a noun (or its equivalent), the post- 
position no and a true adjective. 

4) Various tenses of verbs and verbal phrases used as adjectives. 

TRUE ADJECTIVES. 

192. True adjectives end in ai, ii, oi or ui. These terminations are changed 
according to the way in which the adjective is used, as shown in the following 
table : 

attribute takAi yasashu shiroi samm 

predicate tak\i yasashu shiroi samm 

predicate ) , _ . 

... f tako yasashiu* shtro stimu 

with gozaru ) 

adverb takAKU yasashiKU shiroKU samuKU 

1 93. What remains after taking away the final i of a true adjective is called 
the stem : taka, yasashi, shiro and samu are the stems of takai, yasashii, shiroi 
and samui. The stem is equivalent to a noun and is used sometimes alone ; 
it is to be found very frequently in compounds. See 181, 6, 7; 182, 2 ; 153; 
154. 

1 94. Nai non-existent, and its inflexions which, as we have seen (93), serve 
as the negative of the verb aru 'to be ' 'to have ' is in reality an adjective 
which is often found alone but more frequently still, is used to form the nega- 
tive of adjectives. When used by itself we have the following forms : 

attribute nai 

predicate nai 

adverb naku 

195. The negatives of true adjectives are derived from the adverbial form 
as follows : 

attribute takaku nai 

predicate takaku nai 

adverb takaku naku 

Another construction of adjectives used predicatively in the negative was 
noted in 167, 5. 

196. Ordinary negative adjectives in nai are not used in combination with 
gozaru ; in these polite sentences the negation is to be found in the inflexion of 
the verb itself : 

It is not dear ; takaku nai or tako gozaimasen : never takaku no gozaimasu. 
However, there is no objection to using ordinary adjectives which happen 
to end in nai, as kitanai dirty, before the verb gozaru : kitano gozaimasu. 

*Shiu is pronounced shu.

ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



197. We cannot say naku nai for the negative of nai ; the only form that 
can be used is nai koto rca nai. 

Other adjectives, however, ending in nai. whether compounds of nai or not* 
as sukunai, kitanai, mittomo-nai, deki-nai, form their negatives in the ordinary 
way : stikunaku nai, kitanaku nai, mittomo-naku nai, deki-naku nai. 

198. True adjectives, especially when used as simple predicates (190, 2), 
partake of the nature of verbs and enclose in themselves the meaning of 'to be'; 
thus, takai means not only ' high ', but ' is high '. It is not surprising then, that 
they should have a conjugation analogous to that of the verb, and behave in 
many ways like verbs. All the inflexions may be formed from the stem.

200. The gerundial form of the adjective has great similarity to the verbal 
gerund. (Compare 58, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18). 

1) The adjective that ends a clause or is followed hi English by 'and' is 
put in the gerundial inflexion : Tegami tea nagakutte omoshiroi ; the letter is 
long and interesting. 

2) After the translation of the adjectival gerund we must sometimes use 
other conjunctions besides 'and': Nagasaki wa yasai ga takakute sakana zra 
yasui ; hi Nagasaki vegetables are dear but fish is cheap. 

8) It may signify the reason or cause : Omoktite ikemasen ; as it is heavy 
it won 't do, i.e. it is too heavy. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 51 

4) It often corresponds to 'so' or 'very' in English : Itakute shhjo ga nai ; 
it is so painful I don 't know what to do. 

5) Followed by mo it means 'even if 'although': Yasukute mo kaimasen ; 
I won 't buy it even if it is cheap.* 

6) Wa following the adjectival gerund is emphatic : the final -te of the gerund 
and wa, may be contracted to -dm : lakakute wa or lakakutte wa becomes 
takakucha or takakutcha. 

7) The adjectival gerund followed by wa has sometimes a conditional force : 
Oinokucha ikemasen ; if it is heavy it won't do, i.e. it mustn't be too heavy. 

8) The adjectival gerund is sometimes used elliptically by both men and 
women : 

Kono heya wa semakutte .... (iya da); this room is so small .... (I don 't like it). 
Women have another elliptical use, peculiar to themselves : Omoshirokutte ? 
is it amusing ? E, omoshirokutte yo ! oh, yes !f 

9) The polite verb irassharu or o-ide nasaru after an adjectival gerund imitates 
a common verbal construction : Sei ga takakute irasshaimasu ; he is tall. 

201. We have seen that no following an adjective may mean 'one'. (188). 

202. When the adjective is used predicatively one may sometimes wish to 
employ a construction less curt than the plain adjective, but less stiff than the 
formal gozaimasu. In the negative, this can be done by substituting arimasen 
for nai, and arimasen deshita for nakatta in 199. 

203. In the probable present and past, affirmative or negative, this result 
may be obtained by using desho instead of daro. 

204. In the present tense you may add to the adjective no desu (often ab- 
breviated to n ' desu, desu or even no}. Kore wa chiisai no desu ; this one is 
small. (Compare 86). 

205. In the past tense, no desu may be added to the past inflexion of the 
adjective, or no deshita to the plain adjective : Omoshirokatta no desu or omo- 
shiroi no deshita ; it was amusing. 

Other combinations met with are : omoshiroi no daro (or desho) ; omoshiro- 
katta no deshita ; omoshiroi no dattaro (or deshitaro) ; omoshiroi no dattara (or 
deshitara) ; omoshiroku nai no da (or desu), omoshiroi no de wa nai (or arimasen) ; 
omoshiroku nai no daro (or desho), omoshiroi no de wa nakaro (or arumai) ; 

*ln verbs the past tense may be formed from the gerund or the gerund from the past tense, 
by changing the final c into a or vice versa. In adjectives this is not so : but we obtain a) a 
sort of past inflexion by changing the final e of the gerund into a ; and b) a sort of gerund 
with a past meaning, by changing the final a of the past inflexion into e. The quasi-past (a), 
followed by 'tie has like the past tense of a verb followed by '(te, a meaning of 'even if 
(compares?) : Yasukula (or yasukutta) 'e kaimasen ; I won't buy it even if it is cheap, (from 
the gerund, yasukute or yasukutte). The quasi-gerund (b) is used elliptically by women like 
the true gerund : Yasukatte ? was it cheap ? (from yasukatta, the past inflexion); (compare 
58, 18).

omoshiroku nai no datta (or deshtta), omoshiroi no de zca nakatta (or aritnasen 
deshlta); omoshiroku nai no daro (or desho), omoshiroi no de zra nakattaro (or 
nakatta desho) ; omoshiroku nai no nara, omoshiroi no de nakereba ; omoshiroku 
nai no dattara (or deshltara}, omoshiroi no de nakattara (or arimasen deshltara}. 

206. Adjectives are often used interjectionally in Japanese. L'reshii, ure- 
shii I Oh, I am glad ! (lit. joyful, joyful). Abunai ! take care ! (lit. dangerous). 

207. True adjectives are occasionally, though very seldom, used as nouns : 
Amai mo karai mo shitte iru ; he is a man who knows what 's good, (lit. he 
knows the sweet and the pungent). 

208. The adjectives sukunai scarce and oi plentiful, are not used attributively. 

209. The adjective yoi good, used attributively, is usually corrupted to ii ; 
but all the other inflexions such as yd, yoku, yokatta, etc. suffer no alteration. 

210. The two adjectives yoi good, and nai non-existent, are sometimes used 
colloquially in one of their literary forms, yoshi, nashi. Nashi is usually follow- 
ed by the postposition ni or de and then means 'without'; however it is oc- 
casionally used alone. 

211. The following idiom is worthy of note : 

Atsui no atsuku nai no 'tie, yoke-so deshlta ; talk about heat ! It seemed 
as if I were burning. (Compare 91 ). 



QUASI-ADJECTIVES IX A'a OR No. 

212. Many nouns and stems of verbs, followed by na or no are used attribu- 
tively as adjectives : baka na Into a foolish man ; kin no tokei a gold watch ; 
kirei na hon a pretty book ; shimai no peiji the last page. 

213. In the negative, na (or no) is replaced by de nai : baka de nai Into, a 
not-foolish man. Sometimes fu not, is prefixed : fu-shinsetsu na unkind, from 
shinsetsu kind. 

214. In many cases the noun may be used separately like an ordinary noun . 
Kesa kden de baka zee mitq, I saw a fool this morning in the park ; kin gold. 

215. In many other cases although the word is logically a noun and is treated 
grammatically as such, it generally has the meaning of an adjective, as kirei 
pretty. 

216. Some nouns ma}' take either na or no. The former makes the meaning 
more general, the latter more concrete : baka na hanashi is 'a foolish story'; 
but baka no hanashi means 'the story of a fool'. In some cases na or no may 
be used almost indiscriminately. 

217. When quasi-adjcctives are used prcdicatively, na (or no) is changed to 
de and followed by the verb aru or gozaru. Ano hana tva kirei desu(=de 
arimasu), ano hana ica kirei de gozaimasu ; that flower is pretty. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 53 

Iii negative sentences, tea is put after de. Ano hana tea kirei de wa nai, 
ano hana zca kirei de wa gozaimasen ; that flower is not pretty. (See 94). 

21 8. When used adverbially (1 90, 4> a, b) na (or no) is replaced by m. Shin- 
setsu ni shimashfta he behaved kindly ; kirei ni mieru it looks pretty ; baka 
ni mieru he looks a fool. 

In the negative, de naku may be substituted for na (or no) ; but perhaps it 
is more common to use ni and put the verb in the negative : Baka de naku 
mieru he looks anything but a fool ; baka ni mie-nai he does not look a fool. 

21 9. The quasi-adjective is used as a gerund, very much like a true adjective 
(200); na (or no) is then replaced by de. Kono lion ica kirei de omoshiroi this 
book is pretty and interesting : sore -xa ammari hade de kiraremasen that is so 
showy, I cannot wear it. 

In the negative, de (tea) nakute or de (ura) naku (94) takes the place of na (or 
no) : kirei de nakute mo it even if it is not pretty it will do ; kono hana wa kirei 
de nakute nioi ga warui this flower is not pretty nor of pleasant odour ; omae 
no iu koto tea burei de vca naku machigatte iru what you say is not impolite 
but it is not correct. 

220. The nouns from which quasi-adjectives are formed when used as ordina- 
ry nouns may take any postposition. 

221 . Among the quasi-adjectives formed by na, yd na is of special importance. 
Examples of its use will be found in the Vocabulary, Part III. 

222. A great many quasi-adjectives in no are formed from the names of 
countries, materials, and nouns (adverbs) of time and place : Amerika no lion 
an American book ; kin no tokei a gold watch ; kind no tegami yesterday 's letter ; 
asoko no uchi yonder house. 

223. We have seen that the stem of a true adjective is equivalent to a noun 
(193). This noun-stem may sometimes be followed by the particle na and 
become a quasi-adjective. The most common cases are : 

oki na big, from okii ; 

chiisa na little, chiisai ; 

okashi na ridiculous, okashii ; 

yaicaraka na soft, yawarakai ; 

attaka na warm, ,, attakai ; 

komaka na minute, komakai ; 

ki-iro na yellow, ki-iroi ; 

masshiro na snow-white, , ; masshiroi ; 

rnakka na flaring red, makkai ; 

makkura na pitch dark, makkurai ; 

makkurona jet-black, makkuroi ; 

massao na completely green, % massaoi ; 

mammaru na perfectly round, mammarui. 



54. ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Something similar is found in some compound adjectives, as : 

iji-waru na bad-tempered, from iji no warui. 

The first three of the above quasi-adjectives are only used attributively. 

224. Occasionally the stem of a true adjective followed by no is used as ;i 
quasi-adjective. You sometimes hear aka no instead of akai, shiro no instead 
of shiroi, etc. 

225. Sometimes instead of using the quasi-adjective attributively, we may 
place the two nouns together, forming a compound ; for instance : kara no 
kuruma or kara-kuruma an empty rikisha ; kin no tokei or kin-dokei a gold 
watch. 

226. Do not confound quasi-adjectives ending in ai, like zonzai na careless,* 
with true adjectives, like kitanai dirty. You cannot say zonzai hlto, neither 
can you say kitanai no Into : kirei hlto instead of kirei na hlto a handsome man, 
would be altogether inexcusable as there are no true 'adjectives ending in ei. 
Beginners are very apt to make mistakes like these. 

ADJECTIVAL PHRASES. 

227. A great number of adjectival phrases composed of a noun (or its equiva- 
lent), the postposition no, and a true adjective are used attributively. E.g.: 
genki no ii means literally 'good of spirits', i.e. lively, vigorous; genki no ii 
kodomo means ' a lively child '. 

228. When used as predicates these phrases change no into ga and they re- 
semble ordinary sentences ; e.g.: Ano kodomo zca genki ga ii ; that child is 
lively, (lit. as for that child his spirits are good). 

229. In the past tense ii would be changed to yokatta. In a polite sentence 
ii would be changed to yd gozaimasii. Other adjectives are treated in this 
same way. 

The gerundial construction will be understood from the following example : 
Tsugo ga zvaruktitte ikare-nakatta ; it was so inconvenient I was not able to 
go. 

230. When used adverbially (190, 4, a, b), no is changed to ga or sometimes 
suppressed and the adjective is put in the adverbial inflexion. Kigen ga yoku 
narimashlta he is now good-tempered ; ano hlto tea genki yoku hatarakimasu 
that man works vigorously ; ano Mto zva genki yoku mieru that man looks 
vigorous. 

231 . A great many of these adjectival phrases are formed by means of the 
adjective ii good, and their opposites by means of zvarui bad, or nai, the nega- 
tive adjective. 

"Other quasi-adjectives in ai are : hakurai no imported, hantai no opposite, Ji'frai na 
hateful, shimai no last, shimpai na causing anxiety, tagai no reciprocal, common.

232. The number of these adjectival phrases is practically unlimited, 
following are only a few of the commoner ones :

When no corresponding adjective exists in English these Japanese adjectival 
phrases must be translated by relative clauses. 



VERBS USED AS ADJECTIVES. 

233. Many verbs and verbal phrases may be used attributively in Japanese ; 
they are sometimes rendered into English by an adjective, sometimes by a rel- 
ative clause, (see 328 330). The following are a few examples out of a large 
number that may be rendered by an adjective. 

Tsumi no aru onna ; a guilty woman. 

On wo shira-nai kodomo ; an ungrateful child. 

Futotta hito ; a fat person. 

Deki-nai shigoto ; an impossible work. 

234. When these adjectives are used predicatively in English, in Japanese 
the verb resumes its ordinary functions : no where it occurs, is changed to ga. 

Ano onna wa tsumi ga aru ; that woman is guilty. 
Ano kodomo wa on wo shira-nai ; that child is ungrateful. 
Ano hito wafutotte imasu ; that man is fat. 

The negative of negative verbal adjectives in nai, like deki-nai, mie-nai, etc. 
is formed as in 197. 

235. Some of these adjectives may be used adverbially in English (190, 4, 
a, b) ; but no general rule can be given as to how to treat the corresponding 
verb or verbal phrase in Japanese. Each case must be considered individually. 

He looks guilty ; tsumi ga aru yd ni mieru ; tsumi ga ari-so da. 

To act guiltily ; tsumi na koto wo suru. 

Negative verbal adjectives in. nai take the adverbial form naku when used in 



56 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



connection with the verb naru : deki-naku natta it has become impossible, it is 
now impossible. 

COMPOUND AND DERIVATIVE ADJECTIVES. 

236. Compound adjectives may be composed of : 

1) A noun and an adjective : nadakai famous, from na name, and takai high. 

2) The stem of an adjective followed by an adjective : hoso-nagai slender, 
from hosoi narrow, and nagai long. 

3) The stem of a verb followed by an adjective : zvakari-nikui difficult to 
understand, from zvakaru to understand, nikui difficult. 

237. The adjective kusai malodorous, offensive, added to a noun, means 
that one is reminded of the noun, often in an objectionable way : inaka-kusai 
rustic, (lit. stinking of the country). 

238. If ii (occasionally yasui) is added to the stem of a verb, it means that 
the action is performed easily ; if instead, nikui is added, it means that the 
action is performed with difficulty : zcakari-ii easy to understand ; zvakari- 
nikui difficult to understand. 

239. Nearly all verbs have a desiderative form in -tai which is a true adjective. 
(See 77). 

240. By adding -rashii to a noun we get an adjective which often corresponds 
to our adjectives in 'ish' or 'ly'; it may sometimes be translated by 'seems 
to be'. E.g.: kodomorashii childish; otokorashii manly; jozurashii seems to 
be skilful. (See Part III). 

241 . The termination -ppoi added to certain nouns, stems of adjectives or 
verbs, makes an adjective and generally means that the noun is in excess : 
mizuppoi watery, okorippoi quick-tempered. 

242. An important group of quasi-adjectives in na is formed by adding -so 
(appearance) to the stem of true adjectives or verbs, or to the noun part of 
quasi-adjectives : these adjectives have a meaning of probability. E.g.: 
omoshiro-so na likely to be amusing, furi-so na likely to rain, jobu-so na 
apparently healthy. 

243. The adjective yoi good, and nai non-existent, are irregular when they 
take the -so of probability ; they become yosa-so and nasa-so. The compounds 
of nai may either follow nai in this irregularity or be formed regularly. 

244. Quasi-adjectives in no formed by adding -tote to the stem of a verb, 
refer to an action which has just taken place. Thus : umi-tate no new-laid (of 
eggs), from umu to lay. 

245. The negative of quasi-adjectives is sometimes formed by prefixing fu 
(or bu) 'not': this corresponds nearly to our prefix 'un'. 

From shinseisti na kind, we have fu-shinsetsu na unkind. 

From shiazcase na fortunate, we have fu-shiazcase na unfortunate. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 57 

COMPARISON. 

246. There are no inflexions of the Japanese adjective (or adverb) correspond- 
ing to our comparative and superlative degrees. 

247. When only one of the things compared is mentioned, the sentence may 
be treated in various ways in Japanese : 

1) The quality is merely affirmed or denied. 
Kore iKa yasui ; this is cheaper, (lit. this is cheap). 

Kore tea yasuku nai ; this is not cheaper. . 

Dan-dan okiku naru ; he is growing bigger little by little. 

2) The foregoing sentences are sometimes ambiguous : 

Kore zva yasui, for instance, may mean, 'this is cheap' or 'this is cheaper' 
All ambiguity is dispelled by using ho side. 
Kono ho ga yasui ; this is cheaper. 
Nagai ho ga suki ; I prefer the long one. 

3) Sometimes motto more, is used : 

Motto ii no zvo motte o-ide ; bring a better one. 

Motto omoshiroi hon zco kashlte kudasai ; please lend me a more amusing book. 

4) Mo sukoshi a little more, is also sometimes used. 

Mo sukoshi oki na no ga hoshii ; I want one a little bigger. 

5) When we wish to express an intensified quality like 'still better', we may 
use nao : 

Kore tea nao ii ; this one is still better. 

248. Explicit comparisons, when the things compared are both named, may 
be of two classes : 1) the word 'than ' is not used ; 2) the word 'than' is used. 

1 ) Ho is generally repeated in Japanese : 

Kono hon no ho ga omoshiroi ga mo hitotsu no lid ga yasui ; this book is more 
amusing but the other one is cheaper. 

2) 'Than' may be translated by yori ; this construction is generally avoided 
in Japanese ; the implicit form of comparison (247, 1, 2) is usually preferred : 

Asama yori Fuji (or Fuji no ho) ga lakai ; Fuji is higher than Asama. 

249. 'More' 'some more' or ' any more' is translated as follows : 

1) When it means 'a greater quantity', and the amount is designated : 

a) in a vague way motto : 

I want some more nails ; motto kugi ga iriinasu. 

b) in a definite way mo : 

I want six more nails ; kugi ga mo rop-pon iriinasu. 

2) When it means 'left' or 'remaining' in an affirmative sentence mada ; 
Have you any more nails ? kugi wa mada arimasu ka ? 

There are some more in my room ; watashi no heya ni mada arimasu. 

3) In all negative sentences mo : 



58 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



I don 't want any more ; mo irimasen. 

250. ' A little more ' is translated by mo sukoshi. 

Bring me a little (some) more water please ; mizu ico mo sukoshi motte kite 
kudasai. 

251 . ' The more ' may be translated by yokei, sometimes takusan : 
Which box holds the more ? dochira no hako ga yokei hairu daro ? 

252. 'More than' may generally be translated by ijo or by yori yokei : 
It will cost more than five yen ; go-yen ijo kakarimasu. 

It is not more than one pound ; ik-kin yori yokei de wa nai. 
I have more pears than you ; watashi tea anata yori nashi wo yokei motte imasii- 
This small hen lays more eggs than that big one ; kono chiisai tori tea ano dA* 
na tori yori yokei tarn ago wo umu. 

That is a great deal more than is necessary : sore ja taihen yokei da. 

253. ' Less than ' may be rendered by : 

1) A negative sentence : 

There is less than a pound of sugar in the bag ; fukuro ni am sold iva ik-kin 
tea nai ; (lit. there is not a pound of sugar in the bag). 
It is less than three feet long ; nagasa via san-jaku wa nai. 
You will need less than five yen ; go-yen kakara-nai desho. 

2) Tara-zu : 

There is less than a pound of sugar in the bag ; sato ga ik-kin tara-zu fukuro 
ni haitte iru. 

It is less than three feet long ; nagasa tea san-jaku tara-zu desu. 
You will need less than five yen ; go-yen tara-zu kaltaru desho. 

3) Sometimes by yori sukunai : 

There is less than a pound of sugar in the bag ; sato ga ik-kin yori sukunaku 
fukuro ni haitte iru. 

It is less than three feet long ; nagasa zca san-jaku yori sukunai. 

254. The comparison of ages, as 'so many years older' or 'younger', is 
translated by toshi ga ue, toshi ga shlta, or simply ue, shlta. 

Chichi tea haha yori mittsu (toshi ga) ue desu ; my father is three years older 
than my mother. 

255. Several constructions relating to comparatives are mentioned in 170. 
The following construction is al; o interesting : Tokyo kara mireba Kyoto wa 

semai ; Kyoto is small compared to Tokyo. 

256. When we compare A to B in regard to a certain quality, we may find 
that 1) A has the qualit)' in a greater degree than B, as in the examples given 
in 247 and 248 ; 2) A may have the quality in a less degree than B, as : Xara 
is less important than Kyoto ; or 3) A and B may be equal. 

257. In the second case the beginner had better turn the sentence into one 
of the first class, and say : ' Kyoto is more important than Nara '. Or a con- 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 59 

struction with hodo may be used thus : Nara tea Kyoto hodo oki na tokoro de wa 
nai ; Nara is not as big as Kyoto. 

258. Comparisons of equality are often rendered by the words onaji gurai 
or hodo as shown in the following examples : 

Kiku San wa O Yuki San to onaji gurai kirei desu ; Miss Kiku is as pretty 
as Miss Yuki. 

Yumoto wa Ashinoyu to onaji gurai takai tokoro desu ka ? is Yumoto as high 
as Ashinoyu ? 

Watakushi wa anata to onaji gurai kanega aru ; I have as much money as you. 

Anata tea watakushi to onaji gurai sei ga takai ; you are as tall as I. 

Tatte iru no mo kakete iru no mo nedan zva onaji ; it is as cheap sitting as 
standing. 

In the first four examples to onaji gurai may be replaced by hodo. 

259. 'The the ', may be rendered by hodo, thus : 
Hayai hodo ii ; the sooner the better. 

Okiku naru hodo waruku naru ; the older he grows the worse he becomes. 
Omoeba omou hodo kanashii ; the more I think of it the more sorry I feel. 

SUPERLATIVE. 

260. The simple adjective in Japanese often means implicitly the superlative : 
Dore ga ii ? which is the best ? 

Kore ga ii ; this is the best. 

261 . The superlative may be rendered explicit in various ways : 

1) Ichiban 'number one' is often placed before adjectives: 

Koko de wa nan to iu yado-ya ga ichiban yd gozaimasu ka ? which is the best 

inn here ? 

2) By means of the words ichi, -ju de or de, after a noun of place : 
Nippon ichi no yama ; the highest (most famous) mountain in Japan. 
Tokyo ichi no hoteru ; the best (largest, finest) hotel in Tokyo. 
Kyoto(-ju] de no isha ; the cleverest (most skilful, famous) doctor in Kyoto 
It will be seen that the adjectival idea is vague unless made clear by the con- 
text ; it can however be clearly stated : 

Nippon ichi no takai yama ; the highest mountain in Japan. 

3) By means of uchi : 

Kono uchi de no omoshiroi hon ; the most amusing book from among 

262. 'The most' meaning 'the greatest of several quantil 
by yokei, sometimes takusan : 

Which box holds the most ? dono hako ga yokei hairu daro ? 
283. 'Very' when translated, may generally be rendered by taihe 
zuibun, taiso, naka-naka, yohodo or goku. Sometimes any one of these may 1

used, sometimes only one suits the case and it is not easy fco know which one to 
select. 

TaiJien ii ; it is very good. 

Naka-naka muzukashii ; it is very difficult. 

Goku chiisai kodomo ; very small children. 

264. The gerund of an adjective or verb followed by shiyo ga nai or sMkata 
ga nai which means literally, ' there is nothing to be done' 'there is no help 
for it' is a very common Japanese idiom and corresponds to 'exceedingly' 
'awfully': 

Atsukute shiyo ga nai ; it is awfully hot. 

Kutdbirete sliikata ga nai ; ' I am awfully tired ' or ' I am so tired I don 't 
know, what to do '. 

265. When other negative verbal expressions follow the gerund we often 
have sentences with a superlative meaning which may be translated by 'so' 
or 'too to'. 

Ano liito wa byoki de arukemasen ; he is so ill he cannot walk. 
Kurakute mie-nai ; it is too dark to see. 

266. 'Too', followed by an adjective, after which an infinitive is not found 
(as it is in the last example), is translated by : a) amari followed by the adjec- 
tive ; or b) the stem of the adjective and the verb sugi'ru. 

This bottle is too big ; kono bin tea amari okii, or kono bin wa oki-sugimasu. 

'Too much' is translated by yokei, sugi'ru, or ammari : 

This is too much ; kore wa yokei da. 

You drink too much tea ; anata wa o cha wo nomi-sugimasu. 

Don't drink too much tea ; ammari o cha wo nonde wa ikemasen. 

267. 'As as possible' is translated by dekiru dake or naru-take : 

Run to the house as fast as you can ; dekiru dake hayaku uchi e kakete lite o 
Jcure. 

268. Other expressions with a superlative meaning are to be found in the 
Vocabulary, Part III, under the words, konna, sonna, anna, donna, makoto, 
jitsu, baka, domo, zutto. 

269. 'Not very' ' not so very' may be rendered by amari, sonna ni or so with 
a negative verb : 

It isn 't very interesting ; amari omoshiroku nai. 

He is not so very old ; sonna ni toshiyori de wa arimasen. 

270. 'Fairly' 'moderately' 'rather', etc. are translated by daibu or kanari. 
It is pretty cold this morning ; kesa wa daibu samui.

272. S/ii four, is often avoided on account of its being homonymous with 
shi death. The combination fthi-nin is particularly objectionable and is never 
used hi the sense of four persons ;* see 281. 

The following nouns are also preceded by yo instead of shi : ban number, 



*However if any other numeral intervenes between shi and nin, shi may be used ; e.g.: 
ehi-go-nin, four or five persons. 



62 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



dai auxiliary numeral for carriages, do times or degrees, ji o'clock, nen 
year, ri Japanese mile. The word rin 1/10 sen, takes either yo or yon; and 
the word sen 1/100 yen, generally takes yon. 

273. On account of the great similarity of the sounds shi four and shichi 
seven, yo (or yon) is often used instead of shi, (see 272), and nana instead 
of shichi in order to avoid the possibility of a mistake : this is especially the 
case when speaking of money. In like circumstances, ku is often replaced by 
kyu, perhaps on account of its similarity with rokn. 

274. Remnants of the second set of numerals above ten are to be found in 
the words, hatachi twenty years, hatsuka the twentieth day, and misoka the 
last day of the month (lit. the thirtieth day). 

275. The third set of numerals is used in counting over things, e.g. linen to 
be sent to the wash : one, two, three hii,fu. mil. . . . 

276. In other cases the set to be used depends on the noun to which the 
numeral refers : 

1) A few nouns take the first set without any auxiliary numeral ; in this 
case the numeral precedes the noun : e.g. two yen ni-yen ; fifty sen go-jis-sen ; 
three o 'clock san-ji : six hours roku-jikan. These nouns are all units of time, 
money, weight, or measure ; the commonest are : nen year ; shukan week ; 
jikan hour ; ji o'clock ; fun minute ; byo second ; yen ; sen ; rin 1/10 of a sen ; 
ri Japanese mile ; shaku foot ; sun inch ; bu 1 /10 of sun or other units ; kin 
pound (Ib.) ; wari 10 per cent ; lien, do, tdbi a time ; kai storey ; gyo row. 

2) Most nouns take the first set with an auxiliary numeral ; in this case the 
usual order is : noun, numeral, auxiliary numeral : e.g. six men Into roku-nin ; 
eight plates sara hachi-mai ; three books hon san-satsu. You may also say : 
roku-nin no Into, etc. ; in complete sentences the no may be dropped, Ano heya 
ni roku-nin hito ga iru there are six men in that room. 

3) A good many nouns take the second set ; the numeral is generally placed 
after the noun : e.g. two eggs tamago futatm ; three chairs isu mittsu ; four 
boxes hako yottsu. You may also say : futatsu no tamago, etc. 

4) A few nouns take the second set after suppressing the final tsu ; 1 Into, 
2 fitta, 3 mi, 4 yo, 5 itsu, 6 mu, 7 nana, 8 ya, 9 kokono, 10 to : the numeral comes 
before the noun : e.g. two nights futa-ban; three boxfuls mi -hako ; eight months 
ya-tsuki. The commonest nouns used in this way are : tsuki month : ban 
night ; ma room ; fukuro bagful ; hako boxful ; yama heap : soroi set ; suji line ; 
kumi set ; kire slice ; sara plateful ; saji spoonful : a shi step ; tsutsumi packet ; 
hari stitch ; shina article ; iro kind; tokoro place; bin bottleful ; tabi time. 
Certain nouns, used figuratively like anshin, kuchi, kuro, me, etc. may take 
htto-, but never futa-, mi-, etc. 

277. Questions relating to number are asked in different ways according 
to how the numerals are used in the simple affirmative (276). In general when 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 



the first set of numerals is used in the affirmative, it may be replaced by either 
iku or nan in the interrogation ; the second set is replaced by ikutsu ; the ab- 
breviated second set by iku. Taking the same examples as above, we have - 
1) iku-yen ? how many yen ? nan-sen ? how many sen ? iku-ji ? what o'clock ? 
nan-jikan ? how many hours ? 2) Into iku-nin ? how many men ? sara nam- 
mai ? how many plates ? hon iku-satsu ? how many books ? 3) tamago ikutsu ? 
how many eggs ? isu ikutsu ? how many chairs ? hako ikutsu ? how many 
boxes ? 4) iku-ban ? how many nights ? iku-hako ? how many boxfuls ? iku- 
tsuki ? how many months ? 

278. Some nouns may be used in more than one way ; thus : we have hako 
hitotsu, and hito-hako. There is, however, a slight difference in the meanings 
of these two expressions ; the first means 'one box', the second 'one boxful'. 

279. When a postposition is used, it comes immediately after the noun : 
isu wo futatsu katta ; I bought two chairs. 

280. When a numeral of the first set is followed by a noun or an auxiliary 
numeral (276, 1, 2), the end sound of the numeral and the first sound of the 
noun (or auxiliary numeral) may either or both suffer modifications as shown 
in the following table :

For the purposes of these letter changes, w is sometimes treated like an h 
as in ichi-ica or ip-pa, sam-ba, rap-pa, jip-pa, hyap-pa and sem-ba, from :ra the 
auxiliary numeral for birds, and bundles of things tied together. 

The interrogative pronoun nan and the word ban half, are treated for the 
purposes of these letter changes like son. 

AUXILIARY NUMERALS. 

281. The following are the commonest auxiliary numerals. In each case 
the irregularities or special euphonic changes are noted : 

NIN for men : 1 hltori, 2/utari, 3 san-nin, 4 yottari or yo-nin, 5 go-nin, 6 roku- 
nin, etc., ikutari ? iku-nin ? nan-nin ? 

HON for long cylindrical things, such as sticks, trees, pens, bottles, etc.,

8 sam-ba, 6 roku-zca or rop-pa, 10 j ip-pa, 100 hyap-pa, 1000 sem-ba, nam-ba ? 

DAI for jinrikishas, carriages, etc.: 4 yo-dai.

cho, 10 j it-cho. 

HAI for glassfuls, cupfuls, etc.: 1 ip-pai, 3 sam-bai, 6 rop-pai, 10 jip-pai, 100

FUKU for scrolls, sips of tea, whiffs of tobacco, etc.: 1 ip-puku, 3 sam-buku, 
6 rop-puku, 10 jip-puku, 100 hyap-puku, 1000 sem-buku, nam-buku ?

numeral, as bundles, parcels, etc.: 1 ik-ko, 3 san-ko, 6 rok-ko, lOjik-ko, 100 
hyak-ko, 1000 sen-ko, nan-ko ? 1 ik-ka, 3 san-ka, 6 rok-ka, 10 jik-ka, 100 hyak- 
ka, 1000 sen-ka, nan-ka ? 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 65 

282. The construction with the noun is usually as follows : noun, (post- 
position ga, mo, wa, or zco, if used), numeral, auxiliary numeral, (postposition 
ka or yori, if used) ;* e.g.: six postcards hagaki roku-mai ; please give me two 
postcards, hagaki wo ni-mai kudasai ; I'll give him two pencils or two note- 
books, empitsu ni-hon ka chomen (wo) ni-satsu ageyu. 

283. When you don't know which is the proper auxiliary numeral to use, you 
had better employ the second set of numerals. It may not be correct Japanese, 
but you will be understood ; whereas if you use an incorrect auxiliary numeral 
you may not be understood at all. For instance, if instead of sara ni-mai (two 
plates) you say sarafutatsu, it is not usual, but it is intelligible : sara ni-hon 
would be unintelligible. 

ORDINAL NUMBERS. 

284. Ordinal numbers are not much used in Japanese : the cardinals are 
often used instead. 

285. Ordinal numbers are formed by adding bam-me to the first set of nu- 
merals or me to the second : sam-bam-me the third ; nanatsH-me the seventh. 

286. These ordinals may both be followed by postpositions : sam-bam-me 
kara shichi-bam-me made or mittsu-me kara nanatsu-me made, from the third 
to the seventh. 

287. When the ordinal number is used before a noun, we may again classify 
the cases as in 276. 

In the case of the nouns that belong to classes 1) and 4), me is added to the 
noun : roku-jikam-me the sixth hour ; mi-hako-me the third boxful. 

In classes 2) and 3), the ordinal number derived from the first set of numerals 
is put first, then the postposition no, and after that comes the noun : e.g. roku- 
bam-me no hlto the sixth man ; hachi-bam-me no sara the eighth plate ; sam- 
bam-me no isu the third chair. In the case of class 2) the auxiliary numeral is 
often used instead of ban, thus : roku-nim-me no hito the sixth man ; ni-kem-me 
no uchi the second house. Sometimes, especially in the case of class 3), instead 
of using the ordinal number derived from the first set of numerals, the ordina! 
derived from the second set is used and followed as above by no and the noun ; 
e.g. mittsu-me no isu the third chair. 

288. Ichi-bam-me no, ni-bam-me no, etc., hitotsu-me no, futatm-me no, etc. 
when not followed by a noun, mean ' the first one ' ' the second one ' etc. (1 88). 

289. The following expressions are related to this subject : hajime no the 
first one ; ichi-ban shimai no the last one ; tsugi no the next one ; ato no the one 
after ; mae no the one before. 

*When the postposition is de, e, made, or n the construction is as follows : two dogs 
barked at me ni-hlki no inu ni hoerareta.

ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



DATES. 

290. Dates are expressed in Japanese by naming first the year, then the 
month and then the day. E.g.: 26th of July, 1917 ; Taisho roku-nen, shlcJii- 
gatsu. ni-ju-roku-nichi. 

291. The Japanese count their years by eras which correspond to the reign 
of each sovereign. The present era is called Taisho and began on the 31st 
July, 1912. To pass from the Christian era to the era of Taisho and vice versa, 
subtract or add 1911. Before the Taisho era was the era of Meiji, which 
began in 1868 and ended at the death of the late Emperor on the 30th July, 
1912. To pass from the Christian era to the era of Meiji or vice versa, sub- 
tract or add 1867. The year is expressed by naming first the era, then the 
cardinal number of the year and then the word nen year ; thus A.D. 1917 is 
Taisho roku-nen. 

292. In a cardinal sense we may say either ichi-nen or ik-ka-nen one year, 
ni-nen or ni-ka-nen two years, etc. 

293. The months of the year (excepting January) have no proper names in 
Japanese : they are distinguished merely by a number. We give below the 
numerals combined with month (tstiki, getsu or gatsu) in both a cardinal and 
an ordinal sense.

The last day of the month (whether 30th or 31st) is called misoka and the 
last day of the year o-misoka. 

295. The numerals for the days of the month are used also in a cardinal 
sense : thus ichi-nichi means 'one day'; futsuka 'two days'; etc. Nan-nichi? 
iku-nichi ? or ikka ? 'how many days ?' or 'what day of the month ?' 

Note : you cannot say tsuitachi for 'one day'. 

296. When speaking of years, months or days in an ordinal sense but without 
reference to date, the suffix -me is used ; thus : the second year ni-nem-me ; 
the third month mi-isuki-me or san-ka-getsu-me ; the fourth day yokka-me, 
' The first ' may be translated by hajime no. 

297. The week has not as much importance in Japan as it has in Europe ; 
the names of the davs of the week are :

TIME. 

298. The time of day is rendered by means of the words ji, fun, byd, hour, 
minute, second. 

Ichi-ji ju-go-fun (sugi) ; fifteen minutes past one, i.e. a quarter past one. 
Ni-ji san-ju-go-fun ; two thirty-five, i.e. twenty-five minutes to three. 

299. The word sugi past, is used more frequently when the number of minutes 
is small, rarely when the number of minutes is large. 



68 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



When only a few minutes are wanting to the hour we may also use a construc- 
tion with mae before, thus : ichi-ji go-jip-pun or ni-ji jip-pun mae ; 'one fifty' 
or ' ten minutes to two '. 

The following expression is also worthy of note : jip-pun de ni-ji ten minutes 
to two. The idea here seems to be that 'only ten minutes are wanting'. 

300. When the time is so many minutes past twelve, the Japanese often say 
zero o'clock (rei-ji) instead of twelve o'clock (ju-ni-ji). Ten past twelve; 
rei-ji jip-pun or ju-ni-ji jip-pun. 

301 . Ante meridian and post meridian are expressed respectively by gozeti, 
and gogo. Asa morning, him middle of the day, ban evening and yom night. 
are also used. All these words, often followed by the postposition no. are 
placed before the number of hours. 

Gogo no shichi-ji ni-ju-go-fun or ban no shichi-ji ni-ju-go-fun ; 7.25 P.M. 
The expressions, him mae forenoon, and him kara or him sugi afternoon, are 
often used to express the time of day, but rarely when specifying the hour. 

302. The word fun preceded by a numeral has the following irregularities ; 
1 ip-pun, 3 sam-pun, 6 rop-pun, 10 jip-pun. (See 280). 

303. Except when speaking of a railway time-table, or such like things. 
instead of 'thirty minutes' you say 'half in Japanese just as in English : 
san-ji han, 'half past three'. A 'quarter', however, is always 'fifteen minutes* 
ju-go-fun, in Japanese. 

304. When speaking of duration, the word kan must be added to ji, fun, 
byd : san-ji-kan three hours ;jip-pun-kan ten minutes. Kan may also be added 
to other units of time when used in this sense : mi-tsuki, mi-tsuki-kan, san-ka- 
getsii and san-ka-getsu-kan all mean 'three months'. 



VARIOUS XI MKRICAL EXPRESSIONS. 

305. Fractional numbers. The way to express fractional numbers will be 
understood from the following examples : 

1/3 sam-bun no ichi 

3/4 ski-bun no son 
A/B B-bun no A 

306. The word 'half is han, or ham-bun when used substantively. The 
following examples will illustrate how these words are used : 

han-gin, half a pound (lb.). 
han-nichi, half a day. 
han-jikan, half an hour. 
icjii-jikan han, an hour and a half. 
ichi-ji han, half past one. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 69 

hambun de takusan ; half will be enough. 

bin ni mizu ga hambun arimasu ; the bottle is half full of water. 
ano nashi wo hambun tabete. hambun tomodachi ni yarimashita ; I ate half 
that pear and I gave half to my friend. 

307. The word bu, when not otherwise qualified, means the tenth part of 
another unit. 

308. Per centage. The Japanese unit zcari is not a ' per cent ' but a ' per 
ten'. Thus ichi-wari, ni-wari, etc. mean 'one per ten' 'two per ten', etc. i.e. 
'ten per cent' 'twenty per cent', etc. The tenth part of the vcari is a bu which 
therefore corresponds to our 'per cent'; ichi-bu, ni-bu, etc. is 'one per cent' 
'two per cent', etc. 

309. Multiples are expressed by the word bai, thus: bai double; sam-bai 
three times as much ; shi-bai four times as much ; etc. 

310. Age. The second set of numerals is used in speaking of ages ; excep- 
tionally : 'tw r enty (years of age)' is hatachi. 

ikutsu desu ka ? yattsu (ni-ju-ichi) de gozaimasti ; how old are you ? I am 
eight (twenty-one). 

311. The Japanese count their ages by adding 1 on the first of January. A 
baby is 1 from birth until the New Year ; it becomes 2 then, even if only one 
day old.* 

312. This is the usual way of reckoning one 's age ; it is called kazoe-doshi 
\kazoe'ru to count, toshi year]. If you wish to refer to complete years, in the 
European style, you prefix maru : mam ju-roku, sixteen (complete) years of 

age. 

313. House numbers. The first set of numerals is used ; they are followed 
by ban if referring to the European part of the town, or by ban-chi if referring 
to the Japanese part. 

314. House storeys. The storeys or floors of a house are named by means 
of the first set of numerals and the word kai ; ni-kait\vo floors, means in English 
'the first floor' i.e. the floor above the ground floor; san-gai is 'the second 

floor', etc. 

315. Vagueness is often expressed in Japanese as in English by means o 
two numerals. In English these are joined by the conjunction 'or', in Japan- 
ese, as a rule, no conjunction is used. This construction is found in both the 
first and second set of numerals. E.g. two or three ni-san or futatsu mitts* ; 
thirty-four or thirty-five san-ju-shi-go. 

316. The words 'several' and 'few' may often be translated 
e g. bring me a few pears nashi wo mittsu yottsti motte kite kure. 

317. When two numerals are thus combined to indicate vaguen 

*** *"* 



*The apanese generally include the first and 
hatsuka made from the tenth to the twentieth of the month ,s 11 day*, not 



70 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



ordinary numerals often take the place of special words ; thus, although you 
never say ni-nichi for futsuka two days, and never san-nichi for mikka three 
days, you may say either ni-san-nichi or futsuka mikka for 'two or three days', 
etc. 

318. 'About' before a numeral, is usually translated by kurai, hodo or bakari 
when it means approximate quantity ; by goro when it means approximate 
moment or date. E.g. about ten yenju-yen gurai ; about three o'clock san-ji 
goro ; about the second of next month raigetsu no futsuka goro. 



CHAPTER VI. 



PRONOUNS. 



PERSONAL, POSSESSIVE AND REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS. 

319. Personal and possessive pronouns are very little used in Japanese. 
The use of honorific or humble words, or the context shows what person is 
meant. 

320. In isolated sentences such as those found in dictionaries, grammars, 
etc., personal pronouns are used more freely than they are in real life. 

321 . When necessary, the personal pronouns may be translated as follows : 
I : zcatakushi (polite), frequently contracted to watashi, or even (by women) 

to atashi ; boku (used by young men and boys). 

WE : (others and I) watakushi-domo ; (you and I) anata to wataktishi (to). 

YOU : (singular) anata (polite) ; kimi (corresponding to boku) ; omae son ; 
oniae (used only to one's inferiors). 

YOU : (plural) anata-gata, omae-tachi, omae-san-tachi. 

HE, SHE : ano (o) kata (polite) that person ; ano Into that person ; ano otoko 
that man ; ano onna that woman ; are that man (or woman). 

IT : are, kore, sore. 

THEY : (persons) ano hito-tachi ; (things) are, kore, sore. 

In the 3rd person kono 'this' or so-no 'that' (near) may be substituted for 
ano 'that' (far). 

322. 'They say' is rendered by so da or to iu hanashi da. See 166, 4. 

323. Personal pronouns are nouns and may be followed by any of the post- 
positions. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 71 

324. Possessive pronouns are formed by adding no to the personal pronouns : 
they become quasi-adjectives. Thus: anata no means 'your'; it may also 
mean 'yours'. See 188. 

325. 'My 'and 'our' are often translated by uchi no (lit. of the house) : 
uchi no inu our dog. 

326. The word 'self is often not translated into Japanese (149). When 
necessary it may be rendered by jibun or hltori used as adverbs, and usually 
followed by de. In speaking respectfully to or of. a person, we say go jibun 
or o hltori. 'Of itself meaning 'spontaneously' may be translated by shizen 
ni : 

Shizen ni kusa ga haemashita ; the grass grew of itself, (I didn't sow any 
seed). 

327. Reciprocity may be expressed when necessary by (o) tagai : 

O tagai ni naka yoku shimasho ; let us be on good terms with each other. 



RELATIVE PRONOUNS AND ADVERBS. 

328. There are no relative pronouns in Japanese. 

Sentences with relative pronouns are generally translated as follows : the 
relative pronoun is omitted, and the relative clause is placed before the noun 
to which the pronoun refers. It thus becomes a verbal phrase used attribu- 
tively (233). The subject of the relative clause, if expressed, is followed by 
the postposition no or ga. 

Ano yama no ue ni haete iru oki na matsu ; the large pine-tree which grows 
on the top of that mountain. 

Shi-nakereba nara-nai koto desu ; it is a thing which must be done. 

Watakushi no mita hito wa, or watakushi ga mita hlto wa ; the person that I 
saw. 

329. The following examples will serve to show how to translate a relative 
clause preceded by a preposition : 

That is the company for which I am working ; are ga zcatakushi no hataraite 
iru kaisha desu. 

That is the town to which I am going ; sore ga watakushi no iku machi desu. 

I have read the book in which that tale occurs ; sono hanashi no kaite aru hon 
wo yomimashita. 

The steamer by which he sailed is the biggest of the company ; ano hito no 
nottafune zva sono kaisha no ichiban okiifune desu. 

330. In the relative clause only verbs in the present and past tenses are 
used ; and of these tenses, the polite forms, i.e. those ending in masu, are not 
often met with. 



72 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



331 . The passive is not often used in Japanese in this kind of construction ; 
when a passive verb is found in English in a relative clause, the sentence is 
generally changed to avoid this construction in Japanese : 

1) The passive may be changed into the active : 

The tree (that was) planted by my father ; chichi ga ueta ki, i.e. the tree that 
my father planted. 

2) Especially worthy of notice is the translation of 'called' or 'named' by 
to iu : 

Suzuki to iu hlto ;'a man called Suzuki, (more lit. a man they call Suzuki). 

3) The passive is, however, occasionally used : 

Inu wo korosareta hUo tea ano hlto desu ; that is the man whose dog was killed. 
Taro ni kowasareta koppu tea kind katta bakari no desu ; the tumbler 
which Taro broke was the one I had only just bought yesterday. 

332. Relative clauses are often translated in other ways, some of which are 
shown in the following examples : 

Mune no icaruku naru hanashi ; a story which it makes one feel sick to listen 
to. 

Sono meishi no kata ; the gentleman who left that card. 

Musume ga hitori atte Haru to moshimasu ; he has one daughter whose 
name is O Hani. 

333. The relative pronoun 'what', which is equivalent to 'the thing which', 
is translated by koto or mono (sometimes contracted to no) .* 

Kino mita koto ; what I saw yesterday. 

Anaia no ossharu no rca honto desu ; what you say is quite true. 

334. ' Where ' as a relative is often translated by tokoro : 

Is this where we take the boat ? koko gafune ni noru tokoro desu ka ? 

335. 'When' as a relative is translated in various ways : 

1 ) In the sense of ' at the time ', by toki (ni) orjibun (ni) : 
When I lived in Yokohama ; Yokohama ni ita toki (ni). 

2) In the sense of ' by the time ', by made ni : 

It will be done when you come ; o-ide nasaru made ni kitto dekite imasu. 

3) In the sense of 'after' or 'as soon as'. 

a) In general statements first form of the present and to. 
When the bell rings the train starts ; kane ga naru to kisha ga deru. 

b) Referring to the future past conditional. 

When you have finished come to my room ; sundara icatashi no heya ni o-ide. 

c) Referring to the past generally by first form of the present and to ; 
Sometimes by the past conditional. 

When he arrived it started to rain ; ano hUo ga kuru to ame ga furi-dashita. 
When I told him what you said he got very angry ; oshatta koto wo itlara 
taihen okorimashita.

74 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



337. The English translations given in the above tables only show very 
imperfectly how these pronouns are used in Japanese. The numerous exam- 
ples found in the Vocabulary, (Part III), and in Exercises 74, 75, 76 and 77 
(Part I), should be carefully studied. In the Vocabulary under the word dare, 
for instance, examples of the other expressions in that line, dare ka, dare mo 
and dare de mo will be found ; in Exercise 75, for instance, examples of dare ka, 
donata ka, and the other expressions in that column are grouped together so as 
to show clearly the force of ka in these combinations. 

338. Kochi, sochi, achi, and dochi are generally pronounced kotchi, sotchi, 
atchi, and dotchi. 

339. Asoko is very often corrupted to asuko, and nani is frequently contracted 
to nan. 

340. The nouns dore and dotchi both correspond to the interrogative ' which ? * 
but dore is used when referring to more than two, and dotchi when speaking of 
two things only. Dono is an adjective, it also means 'which?' and refers to 
more than two things. 

Nihon de dore ga ichiban takai yama desti, ka ? which is the highest mountain 
in Japan ? 

O cha to kohii to dotchi ga o stiki desu ? which would you like, tea or coffee ? 
Dono hon wo yondara ii desho ? which book would you advise me to read ? 

341 . Interrogatives in connection with numerals are explained in 277. 

342. Interrogative pronouns, when used as subject, takega, never wa : dare 
ga kimashita (ka) ? who has coane ? 

343. Kore, kono, etc. refer to things near the speaker ; sore, sono, etc. to 
things at some little distance or things connected with the 2nd person ; are, 
ano, etc. to things still farther away. Sore is used when referring to something 
just said or done by the 2nd person. 

344. Kore, sore and are may be followed by any postposition. 

345. Kore, sore and are may denote time : kore is the present moment, so 
kore kara 'from now on' means 'in future' ; sore kara 'after that' may refer to 
past or future ; are kara ' after that ' refers always to the past. 

346. Kono, sono, ano and dono are often equivalent to kore no, etc. 

347. Kono denotes time in the common expressions : kono aida (or konaida) 
'a short time ago', (something recent, but past) ; kono-goro ' of late ' (some- 
thing recent which still continues). 

348. Kono gurai 'about this much', kore dake 'this much', kore hodo 'so 
much as this', and the corresponding expressions in sono, sore, ano, are, dono, 
dore are often met with. 

349. Konna, sonna, etc. used attributively, are often contemptuous. 
The meaning of the adverbiat*forms, konna ni, etc. is similar to a superlative 
and may be inferred from the following examples : 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 75 

Konna ni muzukashii skigoto tea deki-nai ; I cannot do such difficult work 
as this. 

Sonna ni muzukashii no desu ka ? is it as difficult as all that ? 
Sonna ni muzukaslnku nai ; it is not so very difficult. 

350. Ko generally refers to something which is going to be said or done ; so 
to something which has just been said or done. 

Watakushi wa ko kangaemasu . . . . ; this is what I think .... 

Dare ga so iimashUa ? who said so ? 

So shite wa ikemasen ; don 't do it like that. 

351 . Do as an interrogative, can generally be, and often is, replaced by ikaga 
which is more polite. 

Ika hodo is a polite substitute for ikura. 

352. When inquiring about a place, doko no is generally used instead of 
dono : 

Doko no gakko e ikimasu ka ? to what school are you going ? 

353. To ask the name of a thing we use nan to : 

Kono kudamono wa nan to iimasu ka ? what do you call this fruit ? 



CHAPTER VII. 



HONORIFICS AND POLITE PHRASES. 

354. The Japanese have the habit of distinguishing in their speech the ac- 
tions and things of the 1st person (or related to the 1st person) to which they 
apply humble words, from the actions and things of the 2nd person (or related 
to the 2nd person) and to these they apply honorifics. They also take into 
account whether the act of the 1st person is related or not to the 2nd person, 
and whether the act of the 2nd person is related or not to the 1st. 
Patois 'I eat (something you have given me)'; but you would 

gohan wo taberu to dekakemashita I went out this morning immediately a 
eating my breakfast. 

Even the relation of superiority or inferiority between the 2nd and < 
persons is sometimes taken into consideration. Thus : o to-san mo me 
kudasai please show it to your father ; but vmsuko san ni misete kuc 
show it to your son. , . 

355. We may divide all verbs and nouns roughly into three classi 

words, honorifics, and humble words. 

t 



76 



ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



The difference may exist in the words themselves which are depreciatory or 
exaltative, or in certain adjuncts which modify the meaning of the principal 
word. 

356. Speaking broadly, humble words are used for the 1st person, honorific* 
are applied to the 2nd person and plain words are employed for the 3rd 
person. 

Each case, however, must be judged on its merits. Thus, if a man is speaking 
to his own servant, he would probably use plain words for both the 1st and 2nd 
persons. On the other hand we often apply honorifics to the 3rd person if we 
want to show special respect, or if that 3rd person is present. 

357. In this way, humble and honorific words in a great measure take the 
place of our personal and possessive pronouns, which, as before mentioned 
(319), are not much used in Japanese. 

358. The following lists will give an idea of the more common humble and 
honorific verbs :

*Kure"fU is used only when speaking of the giving of an inferior, and in this sense it

In the above table nasaru where it occurs may be replaced by ni naru, de 
gozaru, or, somewhat less politely, by de aru. The combination goran de gozaru. 
however, is not in ujse. . , 

The above verbs in nasaru are polite but the plain imperative in nasai as 
o-ide nasai, o yari nasai, goran nasai, etc. is decidedly familiar. Say kudasai 
instead of nasai. 

359. A plain verb may be made honorific by replacing the ordinary inflexions 
by the following periphrases : 1) o, 2) the stem of the verb, 3) nasaru, ni naru 
or de gozaru ; e.g. mo o kaeri nasaimashlta ka ? mo o kaeri ni narimaslnta ka ? 
or mo o kaeri de gozaimasu ka ? have you already returned ? 

Instead of de gozaru, de aru may be used, but the sentence is then appreciably 
less polite. O dekake desu ka ? 'are you going out ?' is, so far as politeness is 
concerned, about midway between dekakemasu ka ? and o dekake de gozaimasu 
ka ?* 

360. In the negative, the constructions in de gozaru and de aru are not much 
used ; when employed it is usual to put zva after the de. 

Between the verbal stem and de gozaru or de aru you sometimes find no liazu 
or no yd : o deki no hazu de gozaimasu he ought to be able to (I expect he can) 
do it. 

361 . Verbal inflexions containing i'ru may be made honorific by changing 
i'ru to irassharu. Yoku hon zco yonde imasu ne 'you do read a lot, don 't you ? ' 
may be said more politely thus, yoku honwo yonde irasshaimasu ne.^ 

Verbal constructions in which suru occurs can be made honorific by replacing 
sum by nasaru ; if itasii is put instead of sum they are made humble. Benkyo 
stmi, benkijo nasaru (polite), to study ; o hanashi suru uchi ni, o hatiaxhi ituxfi 
uchi ni (humble), while I was speaking. 

362. When the action of the 2nd (or 3rd) person is performed in favour of 
the 1st person you use the honorific o, the stem of the verb, and the verb kuda- 

*A polite construction of gozaru after the gerund was noted in 100 

fDe irasaharu sometimes takes the place of de gozaru after a verbal stem or noun : hon wo o 

yomi de gozaimasu ka ? (or de irassltaimasu ka ?) ; go benkyo de gozaimasu (or de irasslaimat*). 

The polite construction of iraslam after the adjectival gonmd was noted in 200, 9. 



78 



ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



saru ;* or else, the gerund followed by kudasaru. Kono tegami wo o yom i 
kudasaimasen ka ? or kono tf garni IKO yonde kudasaimasen ka ? would you please 
read this letter for me ? 

However, if the performer of the act is one's inferior (e.g. one's servant) use 
the gerund followed by kure'ru. Jochu go, yonde kureta ; the servant read it 
forme. (Compare 109). 

363. The verb age'ru placed after the gerund has the result of making the 
verb humble ; occasionally also mosu is placed after o and the stem of a verb 
for this same purpose : 

Yonde agemasho ka ? shall I read it to you ? 
tanomi moshimasu ; I request you. 

364. The following are some of the more common 
nouns :

365. Plain nouns may be made honorific by prefixing the words o or go : 
O tegami tco uke-torimashita ; I have received your letter. 

366. Custom has tacked the honorific prefixes on to certain nouns in such a 
way that the exaltative idea has become very vague : thus o cha tea, o yu hot 
water, etc. are generally though not always used with an honorific, whosesoever 
the tea or the hot water may be : expressions like o-jo-san daughter ; o-shaberi 
chatterbox, are hardly ever heard without the honorific. (See 18). 

367. Sometimes indeed the honorific has entirely lost its meaning as in onaka 
the belly (lit. honourable inside) ; omae (lit. honourable in front), is an im- 
polite way of saying ' you '. 

368. The honorific o is sometimes placed before an adjective. O isoganhlii 
gozaimasu ka ? are you busy ? 



*Kudasaru may only be used after the stem of a verb, if the stem has two or more syllables.- 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 79 

369. We may also make some nouns honorific by adding the word Mr san 
(or sama which is more polite). Thus: imoto means 'my (or his) younger 
sister', imdto san will be 'your younger sister'. 

370. In Japanese you put the surname before the personal name when calling 
a person by his full namo. 

371 . The equivalent in Japanese of our Mr, Mrs, Master, or Miss is Sama 
generally abbreviated to San. It is put after the name. 

372. -Periphrases like : Tanaka San no oku-san Mr Tanaka's wife, Tanaka 
San no musuko san Mr Tanaka's son, are employed when the simple use of san 
might be the cause of ambiguity. 

373. When calling a woman by her personal name o is generally prefixed 
when we wish to be polite. However the o must not be used if the name has 
more than two (Japanese) syllables : Yuki San Miss Snow. Take San 
Miss Bamboo. You cannot say : Sonoe San, nor Kin-ko San (Ki-n-ko). 

374. Besides this use of humble words and honorifics, which serves to dis- 
tinguish my things which are inferior from yours (or his) which are superior, 
there are certain polite inflexions of the verb which must be used when speaking 
to anyone to whom AVC owe courtesy, irrespective of the person who performs 
the action of the verb. If you wish to be polite always use the inflexions of 
the verb in masu, mashita, masho, instead of those without ; and what is the 
same, use desu, deshlta, and desho instead of da, datta and daro. By frequently 
replacing the verb aru by the verb gozaru, a thing which women especially are 
very fond of doing, we can make our conversation still more markedly polite 
and respectful. 

375. The honorifics are often used in ways which at first strike the foreigner 
as strange. Here are a few of the more common polite phrases in which honori- 
fics are to be found : 

Gomen kudasai ; excuse me, (lit. august pardon grant). 

O-kage sama de ; by your kind influence, (lit. by Mr honourable shade). 

seica sama deshlta ; thanks for your kind assistance, (lit. it was Mr honour- 
able help). 

O kinodoku sama ; I am very sorry for your sake, (lit. Mr honourable regret). 

sasshi moshimasu ; I deeply sympathize with you, (lit. I say honourable 
sympathy). 

Go-kuro sama deshlta ; thanks for your trouble, (lit. it was Mr august trouble). 

O machidd sama ; excuse me for keeping you waiting so long, (lit. Mr honour- 
able long-waiting). 

Go taikutsu de gozaimashltaro ; you must have felt bored, (lit. it probably 
was august tedium). 

jama itashimashita ; excuse me for having interrupted you, (lit. I have 
done honourable obstacle). 



80 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Go busata itashimashita ; I have been sadly remiss about calling upon you. 
(lit. I have done august remissness). 

376. In regard to honorifics, there are two things to be carefully avoided : 

1) Never apply San or any .other honorific to yourself. 

2) Do not mix up polite and impolite turns of phrase in one sentence. In- 
stead of ikimashlta ga dame datta, say ikimashlta ga dame deshita, or ittaga dame 
datta. 

377. The question of speaking with the proper degree of politeness is_ of the 
utmost importance in Japanese, so to help the foreigner to form his judgment 
a letter, A, B, C, or D, has been placed after each sentence in the Exercises, 
Part I, and also in the Vocabulary, Part III. A means that the tone of the 
sentence is one of authority or anger, B familiarity, C ordinary politeness. 7> 
respect. 

378. This classification must not be taken too literally ; however, it gives a 
rough idea of the subject and so may be of some help. In speaking to an 
ordinary acquaintance do not use style B and still less A ; in speaking to your 
servant, C would probably be too polite and D would be ridiculous. In case 
of doubt it is better to be too polite than not polite enough. 



CHAPTER VIII. 



POSTPOSITIONS PREPOSITIONS. 

379. The words that in Japanese serve to mark the relation of one word to 
another are placed after the word to which they refer and not before as our 
prepositions. The Japanese equivalents of our prepositions are, therefore, 
called postpositions. 

380. The principal postpositions are: de, e, ga, ka, kara, made, mo, na, ni, 
no, shi, to, wa, wo, ya, yori. For the way each one is used, consult the Vocabu- 
lary, Part III. 

381 . Postpositions generally are placed after nouns or words equivalent to 
nouns ; they sometimes follow adverbs. 

382. Two or even three postpositions may follow tach other in Japanese. 
The principal of these combinations may be found in the Vocabulary, in their 
respective places ; see the words de, made, ni, no, to, yori, etc. As examples 
of three postpositions following each other, these may serve : 

Watashi no de iva arimasen ; it is not mine. 
Dare ni de mo o kiki nasai ; ask anybody. 



01' THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 81 

383. Quasi-postpositions. Certain nouns preceded by the postposition no 
are used very much like postpositions and may therefore be called quasi-post- 
positions. The principal nouns used in this way are the following : aida, ato, 
hoka, kage, kami, kau-ari, mae, maivari, muko, naka, oinole. saki, shimo, shita, 
soba, soto, tame, tsuide, win, ue, lira, ushiro. 

384. These words drop the postposition no after a verb or adjective. They 
also follow kono, sono, and ano without the no ; (remember that kono, etc. are 
equivalent to kore no, etc. as stated in 346). 

So sum hoka (or sono hoka) shikata ga nai ; there is nothing else one can do : 
(not no hoka). 

Kino furimashita kawari ni kyo wa ii o lenki de gozaimasu ; it rained yesterday 
but the weather is fine today ; (not no kazcari). 

Ano uchi wo, semai hoka ni kitanai ; that house is small and besides it is 
dirty. 

Sometimes the noun to which the quasi-postposition refers and the no are 
both omitted. 

(Hako ho) naka ico goran nasai ; look inside (the box). 

Omae ga (watashi no} kawari ni ayamari ni itte o kure ; go and apologize (for 
me). 

385. Here are a few examples of nouns followed by quasi-postpositions : 

tsukue no ue, on the table ; 

mon no soto, outside the gate ; 

hashi no shlta, under the bridge ; 

hako no naka, inside the box. 

386. Phrases like these, i.e. a noun followed by a quasi-postposition, behave 
very much like the nouns (e.g. atarimae, asoko, etc.) from which qtiasi-adjec- 
tives in no are formed (212 et seqq.). 

1) When they come before a noun they take no : 
ATARIMAE no kami ; ordinary paper ; 

HAKO NO NAKA no kami ; the paper inside the box. 

2) As predicates they take de : 
ATARIMAE desu (de arimosu) ; it is usual ; 
HAKO NO NAKA dcsH ; it is in the box. 

3) As predicates in a negative sentence they are followed by de wa : 
ATARIMAE de wa nai ; it is not usual : 

HAKO NO NAKA de rcfl nai ; it is not in the box. 

4) If the verb aru has the meaning of 'there are', they take ni : 
ASOKO ni aru ; there are some there ; 

HAKO NO NAKA ni aru ; there are some in the box. 

5) Before other verbs they take ni or any other postposition ace 
the sense : 



82 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



ASOKO ni mieru ; I can see it there ; 

HAKO xo XAKA ni niieru ; I can see it in the box. 

ASOKO wo miinashlta ; I looked there ; 

HAKO NO NAKA wo mimashita ; I looked in the box. 

ASOKO kara deta ; it came out from there ; 

HAKO NO NAKA kara deta ; it came out from inside the box. 

387. As mentioned in 58, 8, the gerunds of verbs sometimes correspond to 
our prepositions. 

388. Likewise, in 151 we showed that English prepositional verbs may often 
be translated by Japanese compound verbs. 

389. Wa and Ga may both be used after the subject of the verb and the 
problem of determining which is the correct one to use in each particular case 
is an ever-recurring puzzle to the foreigner. 

It is doubtful whether it is worth while learning a lot of more or less com- 
plicated rules on the subject, or whether it is not better to learn a few easy rules 
and trust to your luck, and later on to your instinct, in the cases not determin- 
ed by these rules. 

The beginner may derive some consolation from the fact that there is a good 
deal of variety among the Japanese themselves in the use of wa and ga. 

Some of the following rules or observations may prove useful.* 

390. Wa is used : 1) when it is a question of selecting a predicate i.e.the sub- 
ject is known and we wish to find out or wish to inform somebody what pred- 
icate should be applied to it. The state of mind may be represented by 'A is 
X '. For instance, if I am taking a friend round Tokyo to see the sights, and 
we come across a big building ; the subject is there before his eyes, but he does 
not know whether it is the Foreign Office, the Post Office or what it is. He 
asks : 

Kore wa nan desu ka ? what is this ? 

Kore wa Nippon-Ginko desu ; this is the Bank of Japan. 

2) Similar to the above is the rule that wa is used when the Japanese con- 
struction requires the subject to be placed by itself first, and then followed 
by a question in regard to it, beginning with an interrogative pronoun or 
adverb : 

Ano hito wa dare desu ka ? who is that man ? 

Shio u'ff dono gurai mazatte imasa ka ? how much salt is there (in this) ? 

3) Wa has the effect of separating from the rest of the sentence what comes 
before it and calling especial attention to what follows. It is as if we said : 
'I am speaking of. A, and what I want to say (or ask) is this'. 

Nashi wa mono-oki ni arimasu ka ? He, shokudo ni arimasu. Are the pears 

*For further information see Imbrie's Wa and Ga. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 83 

in the pantry ? no, they are in the dining-room. (I am speaking of the pears, 
are they in the pantry ?) 

As a consequence of this, wa is not used after the subject in a subordinate 
clause. 

4) Wa is generally used when there is a contrast, at least an implied one : 
Watakushi wa mairimasu ; I shall go, (others may go or not as they please). 

5) Wa is specially common in negative sentences. 

6) Wa is used in elliptical interrogative sentences with only a noun, (414, 5) : 
Inu zva ? how about the dog ? or, what of the dog ? 

391 . Ga is used : 1 ) when it is a question of selecting the subject ; i.e. the pred- 
icate is known and we wish to find out, or wish to inform somebody, to which 
subject that predicate should be applied. The state of mind may be represent- 
ed by 'X is B '. For instance, a friend may ask me to take him to the bank ; 
on coming to an imposing-looking building he might ask : 

Kore ga ginko desu ka ? is this the bank ? 

He does not mean ' if this is not the bank, please tell me what it is ' ; but 
* if this is not the bank, please tell me which is the bank'. 
Are ga ginko desu ; that is the bank. 

a) We may consider as a particular case of the above that interrogative 
pronouns, (dare, donata, dotchi, dochira, dore, dono and nani, who ? which ? 
what ?) are all followed by ga : 

Dare ga so ilia ka ? who said so ? 

b) Another application of the above rule is, that in sentences containing a 
formal comparison, the subject takes ga, and the thing with which the subject 
is compared, is generally separated off by wa : 

Kore yori wa are ga ii ; that is better than this. 

2) Except in the case of contrast, ga is used with the subject of aru when it 
has the meaning of, 'there is' ' have (got)' : 

Kane ga arimasu ka ? have you got any money ? 

3) Except in the case of contrast, ga is used before deki'ru (in the sense of 
' can '), iru (to need), and hoshii. 

Nihon-go ga deki-nai ; I cannot speak Japanese. 

4) Ga (or no) is used with the subject of a subordinate clause ; see 328. 

392. In the following examples wa and ga are contrasted. 

Ano kata wa Yamada San desu ka ? is that gentleman Mr Yamada ? (if not, 
who is he ?). The answer might be : lie, ano kata wa Suzuki San desu ; no, he 
is Mr Suzuki. 

Ano kata ga Yamada San desu ka ? is that gentleman Mr Yamada ? (if not, 
which is Mr Yamada ?). The answer might be : He, ano ki no shlta ni tatte iru 
kata ga Yamada San desti ; no, Mr Yamada is the gentleman standing under 
that tree. 



84 ELEMEN'TAKY GKAMMAK 



Kore ti'a ginko desu ka ? is this a bank ? (if not, what is it ?). 

Kore tea ginko desu ; this is a bank (and not a post office). 

Kore ga ginko desu ka ? is this the bank (for which I am looking ; if not, 
which is the bank ?). 

Kore ga ginko desu ; this (and not that building over there) is the bank. 

Kore wa ii no desu ka ? is this a good one ? (or a bad one ?). 

Kore tea ii ; this is a good one (not a bad one) ; this one is good. 

Kore ga ii no desu ka ? is this the good one ? (or is the other the good 
one ?). 

Kore ga ii ; this (not that) is the good one ; this one is the best. 

Some of these examples show that the difference between tea and ga may 
sometimes be rendered by the proper use of ' a ' and ' the '. 

393. De and H\ may both be translated by : at. in, by, of, for. 

1) In the sense of 'at' or 'in', de refers to the place where an action is per- 
formed ; ni to the place where a thing exists. 

Tokyo de kaimashlta ; I bought it in Tokyo. 

Tokyo ni takusan arimasu ; there are a great many in Tokyo. 

2) In the sense of 'by', de is used when speaking of the instrument, ni when 
speaking of the agent : 

Kisha de iku ; to go by train. 

Daiku ni kosJi iraesasemashita ; I had it made by a carpenter. 

3) In the partitive sense of 'of ', either de or ni may be used : 

Nihon no fujin ni (or de) yofiiku wo kiru Into mo gozaimasu ; some of the 
Japanese ladies wear foreign clothes. 

4) When speaking of price, 'for' is translated by de when buying is spoken 
of ; by ni or de when we are talking of selling. 

Ni-yen de katte san-yen ni urimasliita ; I bought it for two yen and sold it 
for three. 

5) When a noun is used as a predicate or in constructions imitating a gerund, 
it takes the postposition de. (Compare 217; 219). 

Inaka defuben da ; it is such a country place that it is not convenient. 

Ame de mo iku tsumori desti ; I intend to go even if it rains. 

This de is often used after the no which serves to substantivize verbs and 
adjectives : 

Kono kami iva Nihon de dekita no de 'oto desu ; this paper was made in Japan, 
it is very good. 

Kyaku ga kita no de ikare-nakatta ; a visitor came to see me so I wasn 't able 
to go. 

(J) When a noun is used adverbially it is followed by the postposition ni.. 
(Compare 218). 

Kin ni mieru ; it looks like gold. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKKN LANGUAGE 85 



CHAPTER. IX. 



THE OTHER PARTS OF SPEECH. 



ADVERBS. 

3S4. Words which in Japanese do duty as adverbs are generally derived from 
other parts of speech. The principal are the following : 

1) True adjectives in their ku terminations. (190, 4 ; 192). 

2) Nouns which serve to form quasi-adjectives in na or no become adverbs 
when they change the na or no into ni. (218). 

3) In some cases the adverbial form in ni is in use but there is no correspond- 
ing adjective : sugu (ni) immediately. 

4) Occasionally a noun followed by de is equivalent to an adverb : maru de 
quite. 

5) Nouns without any postposition : konnichi today ; asuko that place, i.e. 
there. Like ordinary nouns, these adverb-nouns may take any postposition ; 
konnichi made until today. 

0) A few ordinary nouns may be converted into adverbs by reduplication : 
hobo everywhere, from ho side ; tabi-tabi often, from tabi time ; etc. 

7) Stems of verbs : amari too, from amaru to be in excess ; kiri only, from 
kiru to cut. 

8) Gerunds of verbs : hajimete for the first time, from hajime'ru to begin ; 
hokora-zu all without exception, from nokoru to be left over. 

395. There is a large class of adverbs to which to is sometimes added ; as : 
bonyari (to) dimly, iiakkiri (to) distinctly. 

356. The to which is found at the end of other adverbs and which forms now 
an integral part of the word itself, is perhaps often of the same origin : chanto, 
chitto, chotto, jitto, kitto, motto, sotto, zutto. 

397. Onomatopes form a very important class of adverbs in Japanese. They 
are extremely numerous, several hundreds in fact, and each one has its own 
special use. The beginner will not find it worth his while to learn many of 
them at first. They are often formed by reduplication as may be seen by the 
following few examples : 

don-don, in rapid succession ; 

guzu-guzu, (of loitering, or grumbling) ; 

mago-mago, (of being bewildered) ; 

mecha-mccha, (of confusion) ; 

niko-niko, (of smiling) ; 

.< oro-soro, slowlv. 



86 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



398. Adverbs in Japanese as in English may modify verbs, adjectives or 
other adverbs. 

Hayaku aruku, to wajk quickly. 
Osoroshlku warui, dreadfully bad. 
Zuibun zcarui, very bad. 
Zuibun hayaku aruku, to walk very fast. 

399. There is no word in Japanese which corresponds to 'yes'. The usual 
way of replying in the affirmative is to say, hai, e or he and to repeat the verb, 
using the humble verb when necessary : 

Go hon Tea arimasktia ka ? did you find your book ? E, arimashlta ; yes, I 
found it. 

E ico goran nasaimashlta ka ? have you seen my picture ? Hai, hai ken 
shimashlta ; I have seen it. 

It can hardly be said that hai, e or lie by itself means ' yes'. We get 
a nearer approach to ' yes ' in the expression so desu (or more politely, say 5 
de gozaimasu) which means ' that is so ' ; and which sometimes takes the place 
of our ' yes '. 

400. ' No ' may be translated by He ; but it is better to repeat the verb in 
the corresponding negative inflexion. 

401 . It must be borne in mind that the Japanese ' yes ' or ' no ' refers not to 
the objective fact nor to what you have said, but to what they think is in your 
mind. You may often hear things like this : Doko de katia no desu ka ? lie 
jibun de koshiraeia no desu. Where did you buy it ? No, I made it myself ; 
i.e. your question supposes that I bought it somewhere, that is not so, I made 
it myself. 

The result of this custom is, that when answering a negative question tlu-y 
often, but not always, say 'yes' say 6 de gozaimasu, where we would say ' no ', 
and ' no ' He, where we say ' yes ' . Supposing you ask somebody : Kyo ikimasen 
ka ? ' aren't you going today ?' If he does not intend to go he will say : Saijo 
de gozaimasu, and his meaning will be : 'The suggestion implied in your negative 
question is correct ; I am not going '. If on the other hand he does intend to 
go, he will answer : lie, and he means : ' It is not as you suggest ; I am going'. 
However, if the question is: Tetsudatte kudasalmasen ka? won't you kindly help 
me ? he will think you are counting on his help, and his answer may be- : />'. 
tetsudatte agemasu to mo yes, of course I will ; or lie, tetsudaimasen no, I won't. 

Besides the case mentioned, of answering to what is in the mind rather than 
to the words themselves, it is well to notice that the Japanese, especially those 
of the lower class, say ' yes ' : (a) when they think you expect the answer yes ; 
(b) when they think it impolite or inconvenient to contradict what you say or 
what they believe is in your mind : (c) when they haven't understood what 
you said and they think ' yes ' is practically the safest answer to give. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 87 

402. When answering a question, therefore, the best plan is to repeat the 
verb in the affirmative or negative as the case may be. When asking a ques- 
tion the beginner should prefer the affirmative form ; and, when he really wants 
to get a true answer, avoid showing in the question what his own opinion is. 
However, should he use the negative form and be in doubt as to the meaning 
of the reply, he must try to obtain an explicit answer and not merely a sayo 
de gozaimasu or an He. 

Kyo kimasen ka ? aren't you coming today ? 

lie yes (?), no (?). 

Kimasu ka ? kimasen ka ? are you coming or are you not ? 

This last question will probably produce the desired result. 

403. The interrogative adverb, ' why ' is translated by naze or do shite. 
Some other adverbs were mentioned in the chapter on Pronouns ; see 334 
et seqq. 

CONJUNCTIONS. 

404. The conjunction ' and ' between nouns is translated : 

1) By placing to after each noun ; the last to is generally omitted : 

Sato to, pan to, niku wo kaimashita ; I bought some sugar, bread and meat. 

2) Ya placed after each noun except the last, is often used especially when 
the list is not given as a complete one : 

Inu ya neko ga suki ; I am fond of dogs and cats (and other animals). 

3) Da no or to ka may also be placed after each noun, including the last. 
Inu da no neko da no ga suki or Inu to ka neko to ka ga suki ; I am fond of 

dogs and cats (and other animals). 

4) Mo is placed after each noun when the idea is ' both and ' : 
Sakana mo niku mo kaimasho ; I will buy both fish and meat. 
Tokyo ni mo Yokohama ni mo ; both in Tokyo and in Yokohama. 

5) Ni may be used in enumerations after each noun except the last ; it 
has the meaning of ' and also ' : 

Pan ni, sakana ni, niku -wo matte ikimasho ; I will take bread, fish and also 
meat. 

6) Between nouns which are habitually coupled together ' and ' is often not 
expressed in Japanese : oya-ko parent and child ; asa-ban morning and evening. 

405. The joining of verbs or clauses is effected as follows : 

1) The verb or adjective at the end of each clause, except the last, is put in 
the gerundial form : remember that a noun followed by de is construed like a 
gerund (393, 5) : 

Hon wo katte tomodachi ni agemashlta ; I bought a book and gave it to my 
friend. 



88 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Shina ga yoroshlkute, nedan ga yasui ; the quality is good and the price is 
cheap. 

2) The stem of the verb may be used at the end of each clause, except the 
last (82, 9). 

3) Shi is used after verbs, and after adjectives ; the last verb or adjective 
does not take shi. This shi is generally used in conjunction with mo mo, 
thus : 

Ano hito wa Nihon-go mo hanasu shi, ji mo kakimasu ; that man can speak 
Japanese and he can also write the characters. 

Shina mo ii shi nedan mo yasui ; the quality is good and the price cheap. 

4) The conditional is used as shown in these examples : 
Kiki mo sureba mi mo shita ; I both heard and saw. 

Shina mo yoroshikereba nedan mo yasui ; the quality is good and the price 
is cheap. 

5) The frequentative : 

Shabettari warattari shite ita de wa arimasen ka ? weren't you talking and 
laughing ? 

6) After verbs like ' go ' and ' come ', when ' and ' means purpose or object. 
it is translated by the stem of the verb and ni : 

Tori ni o-ide nasai ; please go and fetch it. 

7) Sentences may sometimes be joined by such phrases as so shite (soshlte), 
1 having done so ', sore ni, sono ue, ' besides that '. These expressions are 
also used occasionally after clauses ending in a noun or ni or to. 

S) Sometimes no conjunctival word nor special construction is used : 

Doko no, nan to iu o kata da ? where is he from, and what is his name ? 

Natsu wa suzushii, fuyu wa attakai, jitsu ni ii tokoro da ; it is really a very 
nice place, cool in summer and warm in winter. 

Kane wa nakusu, shigoto wa namakeru, to iu wake de Chobe San sukkari bimbo 
ni natta ; what with losing money and doing no work, Chobe became quite a 
poor man. 

406. 'And' between adjectives is treated as follows : 

1) The gerundial form (200, 1 ; 219) is used for all the adjectives except the 
last. 

Shirokute kirei ; white and pretty. 
Kirei de shiroi ; pretty and white. 

2) It is sometimes necessary to employ two clauses in Japanese where in 
English we only use two adjectives coupled by 'and' : 

The article is good and cheap ; shina ga yoroshlkute nedan ga yasui, (lit. 
the quality is good, and price cheap). 

3) When an adjective is at the end of a clause which is not the end of a com- 
plete sentence it may be treated as above, 405. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 89 

4) Iii Japanese as in English adjectives are sometimes put one after another 
without any conjunctive word : 

Kirei na wakai hlto ; a handsome young man. 

407. ' Or ' is translated : 

1) generally by ka repeated after each noun : what is one sentence in English 
often becomes two or three in Japanese : 

Kore ka are ka ; this or that. 

O taku ni neko ka inu ka ga imasu ka ? have you a cat or a dog in your house? 

Atsui no ga o suki desu ka ? tsumetai no ga yd gozaimasu ka ? do you like it 
hot or cold ? 

Dotchi wo goran nasatta no desu ka ? okii no desu ka ? chiisai no desu ka f 
which did you see, the big one or the small one ? 

2) To ka is sometimes put after each noun : 

Pen to ka fade to ka dotchi ka de o kaki nasai ; write with a pen or a brush 
(but don't use a pencil). 

3) When equivalent to ' if not ', by the negative conditional, or by the nega- 
tive present followed by to : 

Isoga-nakereba o'soku narimasu or isoga-nai to osoku narimasu ; hurry up or 
you will be late. 

4) When 'or' refers to an approximate number it is generally not translated 
(315; 317): 

Go-roku-nen ; five or six years. 

5) 'Either or' 'whether or' in the sense of 'no matter which' is translated 
by mo mo after a gerund or construction equivalent to a gerund : 

Fune de mo kisha de mo ikaremasu ; you can go either by boat or by train. 
O tenki ga yokute mo warukute mo ikimasu ; I will go whether the weather is 
good or bad. 

INTERJECTIONS. 

408. As in most languages, the meaning of Japanese interjections varies con- 
siderably according to circumstances, tone of the voice, expression of face, etc. 
This is especially noticeable in elementary exclamations such as a, e : he. 

409. The principal interjections may be roughly classified as follows : 
Surprise, wonder, admiration : ma, naruhodo, nani, are (corrupted to ara), 

so desu ka, koto (after a verb or adjective). 
Perplexity, hesitation : domo, e to, so desu ne. 
Assent : hai, sayo, so desu, mattaku, nanihodo. 
Dissent : He (sometimes corrupted to iiya), uso, nani. 
Reprimand : kore, sore (often corrupted to kora, sora). 
Calling attention : moshi, moshi moshi, ano ne. 



90 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Joy, exultation : banzai. 

Protest, complaint : masaka, mono (generally after desu). 
Emphasis : domo, koso, ne, sa, wa. 
Final emphasis : ne, sa, to mo, wa, yo, zo (for threats). 

41 0. Interjections like a, e, ne, he, etc. are pronounced sometimes long and 
sometimes short. 



CHAPTER X. 



SYNTAX. 

411. Construction of the sentence. In Japanese, qualifying words come 
before the word they qualify*. Postpositions, of course, come after the word 
or clause to which they belong. 

Akai hon ; the red book. 

Akai hon no ; of the red book. 

Akai hon no nedan ; the price of the red book. 

Kind mita hito ; the man I saw yesterday. 

412. The order of a Japanese sentence is generally as follows : adverbs of 
time or place, or any word on which emphasis is laid ; subject, when expressed ; 
clauses ; dative ; accusative ; adverb : verb : l Komban ( -watakushi ica) 3 hima 
dattara 4 o kd-san ni & tegami zvo e kitto ^kakimasho; Hhis evening, 3 if I am 
free, 2 I 6 certainly 7 will write 5 a letter *to my mother. 

When one clause depends logically on another, the dependent clause is put 
first and the principal verb last. You do not say ' I cannot go because I am 
busy' but 'as I am busy I cannot go' ; isogashii kara ikaremasen. The regular 
order is, however, often inverted and then the dependent clause partakes of the 
nature of an afterthought : ikaremasen, . . . isogashii kara ; I can 't go, ... I 'm 
busy. 

413. The Japanese subject takes the postposition ga or wa, (389-392), oc- 
casionally de. Sometimes, however, these words are not used ; this is particular- 
ly the case when the subject is qualified by a word like mo also, dake only, etc. 

Sore de takusan ; that is enough. 
Ginko de katta ; the bank bought it. 

* Adjectives are sometimes placed in an order which sounds strange to Western ears ; 
thus you may hear both kono onaji liako and onaji konp hako this same box ; likewise, anata 
no daiji na o-jo-aan and daiji na anata no o-ju-san your daughter, of whom you take such 
great care. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN* LANGUAGE 91 

Takusan arimasu ; there is plenty. 

Futari kimashita ; two persons came. 

Watashi mo ikimasho ; I'll go also. 

Watashi dake ikimashita ; only I went. 

In verbal phrases used attributively, the subject takes ga or no (328). Ganku 
no (or ga) kalta e a picture painted by Ganku. 

The object in Japanese takes the postposition wo, in cases of contrast 
occasionally wa ; these however, are omitted if the object is qualified by such 
words as mo also, dake only, etc. 

Tamago wa kaimashita ga, niku wa arimasen deshita ; I bought some eggs but 
there was no meat to be had. 

The English objective case often becomes the subject in Japanese. The 
following are the principal cases in which this happens : 

1 ) The accusative of a potential verb. See 1 29 ; 1 33. 

2) The accusative of a desiderative form often, but not always, becomes the 
subject in Japanese. 

Kamakura ga mitaku wa arimasen ka ? don 't you wish to see Kamakura ? 

3) The verbs wakaru to understand, iru to need ; and the words hoshii desi- 
rous, suki fondness for anything, and kirai dislike. 

Ei-go ga wakaru ; I understand English. 

Kane ga irimasu ; it takes money ; I need money. 

Taro iva nashi ga hoshii ; Taro wants a pear. 

Kudamono ga suki ; I like fruit. 

Tabako ga kirai ; I dislike tobacco. 

4) See also suru used independently, 161. 

In the above cases the English subject, when expressed, takes wa, ni, or ni 
tea in Japanese. 

Kimi nifune ga dekiru ? can you make a boat ? 

Watashi ni wa Ei-go ga wakarimasen ; I don't understand English. 

414. Elipses are very frequently met with in Japanese. 

1) Personal and possessive pronouns, whether as subject or otherwise, are 
very often omitted in Japanese. 

So iimashita ; he said so. 

Kanai ga bydki da ; my wife is ill. 

2) In answering a question, the words of the question are often not repeated. 
Kore wa dare no hon desu ?Watakushi no ; whose book is this ? mine. 

3) The suppression of the final verb. 
Sore wo goran (nasai) ; look at that. 
Ika-nakute wa (narimasen) ; I must go. 

Shibaraku (o me ni kakarimasen deshita} ; (it is) a long time (since we met). 
Watashi no boshi zva doko (ni arimasu ka) ? where is my hat ? 



92 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



Sonna baka na koto ga (dekiru mono ka) ? I 'm not going to do such a silly 
thing as that. 

Nani ! ano Into ga shinda to (iu no desu ka) ? what ! is that man dead ? 

Makoto ni o kinodoku sama de (gozaimashlta) ; I am very sorry for your sake. 

Dozo O Kin San ni yoroshiku (moshi-agete kudasai) ; please remember me 
kindly to Miss Kin. 

Moshi, nc-san chotto (o-ide nasai) ; I say, waitress, just come here a 
moment. 

Kimi no tokoro wa doko (desti ka) ? where do you live ? 

Achira e (o iki nasai) ; go away. 

The following construction is also worthy of note : 

Ano kata ga ikeba watashi wa ika-nakatia no desu ; if I had know r n that man 
was going, I wouldn't have gone ; (ikeba iku to wakareba). 

4) Japanese sentences often break off after keredomo, ga. no ni, ni, or mono 
zvo. which is the same as if we finished an English sentence with a word like 
'but' or 'nevertheless' etc. (See 75; 166, 1 ; 170, 4 ; 171, 2 ; 172, 2, b). 

Sore wa so desu keredomo . . . ; what you say is true no doubt, but (there is a 
great deal to be said against it). 

Areba yd gozaimasu ga. . . ; I wish there were some but (I hardly think there 
are). 

Ko sureba dekiru no ni or ko sureba dekiru mono wo ; you could do it in this 
way if you tried but (you haven 't tried, although you ought to have done so). 

Tenki ga yokereba iku no deshlta ga ; I would have gone if the weather had 
been fine but (it was raining). 

5) A noun followed by wa may be used elliptically in an interrogative sense. 
Inu wa ? how about the dog ? what of the dog ? 

This may mean : ' where is the dog ? ' ' has the dog recovered ? ' ' will you 
bring the dog along with you ? ' or almost anything according to circumstances. 

6) Desu ka ? is used elliptically after a noun (followed or not by a postposi- 
tion), an adverb, the adverbial form of an adjective, or a gerund. The difference 
between this construction and the one just mentioned in 5) is, that the con- 
struction in wa serves to introduce a new subject of conversation about which 
we want information, whereas desu ka ? serves to supplement or complete our 
knowledge which is imperfect. 

If you meet a child on the road you might ask : Gakkd desu ka? I see you are 
going somewhere ; is it to school ? 

Somebody might say to me : So shttara iya desho ? if I do such and such a 
thing, it would probably be disagreeable. I might answer : Watashi desu ka ? 
are you referring to me ? 

Sono nimotsu wo izeaite kure tie up that parcel. Kitsuku desu ka ? do you 
want it tied up tightly ? 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 93 

Ashlta Ueno e iku I am going to Ueno tomorrow. Aruite desu ka ? Are you 
going to walk there ? 

The reader will notice that these questions have an Irish flavour about them : 
Is it to school (that you're going) ? Is it myself (you're speaking of) ? Is it 
tightly (that you want it tied) ? Is it on foot (that you're going) ? 

7) The gerund is often used elliptically ; see 58, 18 : 200, 8. Remember 
that a noun followed by de is often equivalent to a gerund ; 393, 5. 

Sore wa ammari yoku nai koto de. . .(arimasu) ; I don't think you ought to 
have done that. 

8) It is worthy of m>te that when the Japanese say certain polite set phrases, 
they begin by pronouncing clearly, but finish with an unintelligible mumble 
entirely lost in the profundity of the bow with which they accompany the 
words. The result cannot be represented properly in print : 

Senjitsti wa domo arigato gozaimashita ; thanks very much for your kindness the 
other day. 

415. Negatives. There are no negative pronouns in Japanese : instead, the 
verb is put in the negative and the pronoun in the positive : 

Nanni mo shira-nai ; I know nothing, (lit. I don't know anything, or I ignore 
everything). 

The negative of combinations like motte kuru to bring, is always obtained by 
putting the second verb in the negative and leaving the first one as it is. Thus 
'he did not bring it' is motte ko-nakatta (lit. carrying it, he did not come), 
though logically we often might expect mota-nai de kita (lit. not carrying it, he 
came). The result is that these negative sentences are sometimes ambiguous. 
The above example may mean, according to circumstances, (a) he did not come 
at all, or (b) he came but did not bring it. 

416. In Japanese as in English two negatives destroy one another or are 
equivalent to an affirmative. 

Deki-nal koto iva nai ; I can do it (but it is difficult), (lit. it is not a fact that 
I cannot do it). 

417. Double negatives are employed very frequently. The commonest con- 
struction of all is a verb in the negative present conditional followed by ike-nai 
or nara-nai. This conveys a meaning of obligation and may generally be 
translated by 'must'. 

Ko shi-nakereba narimasen ; it must be done in this way, (lit. it won't do not 
to do thus). 

418. You may even find three negatives in Japanese : 

Shi-nakereba nara-nai koto de zva nai ; it is not an obligatory thing, (lit. it is 
not a fact that it is a thing which it won 't do not to do). 

419. An English affirmative sentence is sometimes translated by the negative 
in Japanese : Ko-nai uchi ni ; before he comes, (lit. during his not coming). 



94 ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR 



420. Interrogations are formed by adding A-a at the end of the sentence. 
However if the sentence contains an interrogative pronoun or adverb, ka is not 
necessary at the end : 

Samui desu ka ? is it cold ? 

Dare ga kita ? who came ? 

In familiar speech Am or kae is sometimes used instead of ka. 

421. Various interrogative pronouns and adverbs are mentioned in 336 et 
seqq. ; 403. Questions regarding numbers are explained in 277. 

422. In Japanese as in English, a request is often made in the form of a 
question. 

Hon wo kashite kudasaimasen ka ? would you be kind enough to lend rne your 
book? 

423. What is one question in English may become two or three in Japanese. 
407, 1). 

424. Negative interrogations which in English expect for answer 'yes' are 
sometimes made, in familiar Japanese, by putting the principal verb in the 
affirmative and adding ja nai ka ? isn't that so ? (165, 11 ; 63). 

425. Ne which is often heard at the end of a sentence, especially in the speech 
of women, frequently has a quasi-interrogative force and may often be trans- 

ated by 'isn't that so ?' 

426. Women sometimes ask questions by finishing the sentence with a gerund 
pronounced with a rising inflexion of the voice. (58, 18 ; 200, 8). 

427. Quotations. The repetition of another's words or the expression of one's 
own thoughts is generally done in Japanese in the form of a direct quotation. 

A direct quotation is expressed by to, ko, or so, and a verb like iu, hanasu, 
kiku, omou, etc. To is used always after, ko generally before, and so generally 
after, the words quoted.* 

' Nichiyo made ni kaeru ' to iimashita ; he said : ' I shall be back on Sunday '. 

O tenki daro to omoimasu ; I think it will be fine. 

Yamada San ni, ' sugu nio-ide kudasai' to itle kite o kure ; go and ask Mr 
Yamada to come immediately. 

Yokohama no densha ni ko kaite arimasu : ' Mado kara kao ya te wo dasa-nai 
yd ni negaimasti* ; the Yokohama tram-cars have this notice : 'You are request- 
ed not to put your head or your hands out of the window '. 

''Jibuti no nimotsu zca minna jibun de motte iku ho ga ii ' ; watashi wa so 
omoimasu ; 'Everyone had better take his own parcel' ; that's what I think. 

The words quoted, however, are not necessarily the very words of the 
original speaker. The person who is quoting will change, if needs be, the 

^Sometimes none of these words are used : ' Fune ga tsukimashita ka .*" kiite goran nasai, 
go and ask if the boat has arrived. On the other hand a pleonastic construction with both 
to ar.d ~) is sometimes employed : Suzuki San wa, 'doyo-bi ni kaeru ' to so iimashita, Mr Suzuki 
aid he would return on Saturday. 



OF THE JAPANESE SPOKEX LANGUAGE 95 

honorifics and humble words into plain words or vice versa, and pronouns may 
be used instead of a proper name, etc. 

A servant will say to her mistress : Danna sama wa 'Tokyo e irrassharu' to 
osshaimashita the master said 'I am going to Tokyo'; although the actual 
words were Tokyo e iku. 

Yamada San ga ' anata ni o hanaslii ga am' to itte kimashlta Mr Yamada 
came and said he wished to speak to you, (lit. Mr Yamada came and said * I 
wish to speak to you'). Mr Yamada 's actual words were perhaps Danna sama 
ni o hanashi shltai koto ga gozaimasu I wish to speak to your husband. 

The colloquial ''tie which is often equivalent to to iimasii or to iimashtta, is 
used frequently after a quotation. 

Kirei desu 'tte ; he says ' it 's pretty '. 

428. An indirect quotation is sometimes rendered by means of yd ni 'so 
that' : 

Ashita kuru yd ni (so) itte kure ; tell him to come tomorrow, (lit. tell him in 
such a way so that he will come tomorrow). 

429. Although indirect quotations are occasionally employed, the Japanese 
generally prefer not to use them, and turn the sentence in such a way as to 
avoid them : 

Tell O Haru to come here=call O Haru ; O Haru wo yonde kure. 
Tell Shige to call a rikisha=cause Shige to call a rikisha ; Shige ni kuruma 
zvo yobashUe kure.

Taro and Haruo were brothers. 

4) De wa arimasen ka ? is often used at tin-

of a clause which is not the end of a sen- 
tence : it is often translated by 'and',

nai.

cessive force which may be often transla- 
ted by 'even'; b) qualified satisfaction, a

thing as' or not translated at all. (Com- 
pare 58, 9--11).

meaning. Sometimes however they have 
a meaning of their own. Desu, etc. may 
usually, but not always, be changed to

0. An honorific prefix. It is used before 
ordinary nouns ; before the names of 
women of less than three syllables (373); 
before the stems of verbs (359 ; 363) ; 
sometimes before adjectives. In certain 
compounds like : onaka ; omae ; oashi ; 
the honorific meaning has entirely disap- 
peared, (367). There are many words 
that are practically never heard without 
the honorific o, at least in one of their 
meanings : the following may be men- 
tioned : o-hayo ; o-ide ; o-hiya ; o-kage ; 
o-itoma ; o-jigi ; o-medeto ; o-ehaberi ; 
o-share ; o-hlto-yoahi ; o-jii-san ; o-jd-san ; 
o-kami ; o-kami-san ; o-negai ; o-bd-aan. 
Other words again, though generally 
preceded by the honorific o are sometimes 
used without, thus : (o) bon ; (o) cha ; 
(o) rei; (o) seji ; (o) kashi ; (o) kome ; 
(o) kure ; (o) miya ; (o) aewa ; (o) tagai ni ; 
(o) tenki; (o) tera ; (o) tsuri ; (o) yu ; 
(o) miyage ; (o) machido ; (o) tsukai-mono ; 
(o) kd-san ; (o) td-san. In all the above 
cases the honorific idea is very vague ; 
but before ordinary nouns, o has the force 
of an honorific, and is used, therefore, to 
show that the noun refers to the second 
person : it thus often takes the place of 
our possessive pronouns. 
o tegami wo uke-torimaahUa (C) : 

received your letter. 
O Hana San : Miss Hana (Flower). 
o ieogashiu gozaimashd (D) : 1 suppose you

6i. (Too) many ; (too) much ; numerous. 
Oi is not used attributively except when 
forming part of an adj. phrase as ishi 
no oi yama, ' a stony mountain', and 
even in this case oi may be considered 
as the predicate of ishi, ' a stones - 
are-many mountain ' : oku no is some- 
times used attributively instead of oi. 
The polite form of the predicate used 
before the verb gozar-u is logically do or 
oo ; but it is gen. pron. o. The adv. 
form is oku and refers to number or 
quantity ; the form oi ni refers to degree: 
on account of its form, oi ni is mentioned 
here but it probably is a corr. of oki ni ; 
see okii, oki na.

oi-dasu, [ou to pursue ; dasu to take out]. To 

drive away. 
o-ide, [o honorific ; ide~ru original form of 

de-ru to go out]. O-ide behaves like a 

verbal stem, (therefore a noun), preceded 

by an honorific, (359). 

1) O-ide nasaru, o-ide ni naru, and o-ide dc 
gozaru, are polite substitutes for rrl to 
be ; and used, therefore, of the being of 
the 2nd (or 3rd) person. 

ltd San wa o-ide nasaimasu ka ? (D) : is Mr 

Ito at home ? 
sukkari naoru made ok>,-nai de o-ide nasai 

(C) : don't get up till you have completely

(D) : what newspaper do you take ? 

2) O-ide nasaru, o-ide ni naru, o-ide de go- 
zaru, and o-ide kudasaru are polite sub- 
stitutes for kuru and iku ; and used, 
therefore, of the coming and going of the 
2nd (or 3rd) person : o-ide kudasaru sup- 
poses that the act is performed in favour 
of the 1st person. 

mata o-ide nasai (B) : please come again. 
Tanaka San mo issho ni o-ide kudasaimasu 
ka ? (D) : is Mr Tanaka also going with us ? 

3) O-ide is sometimes foil, by the contr. 
verb desu, etc.: it may have the meaning 
of being, coming or going, but is less polite 
than the expressions given in 1) and 2). 
O-ide by itself, as an imperative, is 
impolite. 

ltd San wa o-ide desu ka ? (C) : is Mr Ito 

at home ? 
Tanaka .Son mo issJio ni o-ide desu ka ? (C) : 

is Mr Tanaka also going with us ? 
chotto matte o-ide (A) : wait a moment. 
o-ide (A) : come here. 

4) O-ide nasaru is used after the gerundial 
form of true adj. although in this case vru 
to be, cannot be used, (200, 9). 

atama ga itakute o-ide nasaimasu (D) : he 

has a headache. 
anata wa sei ga takakutte o-ide nasaimasu 

(D) : you are tall. 
-')) The fact that o-ide is a noun is clearly 

seen in the foil, example : 
anata ga kura wo tateyo to shite o-ide no 

jimen wa doko desu ? (C) : where is the 

plot of land on which you are thinking of 

building a godown ? 



We might say ahlte iru jimen or shite o-ide 
nasaru jimen, as a verbal adj. used at- 
tributively is placed directly before the 
noun (233) ; but a quasi-adj., i.e. a noun 
used as an adj., is always connected with 
the noun by the ppn. na or no, (212). 
6) Various. 

konaida o-ide no toki ni niwa wo goran 
deshita ka ? (C) : when you were here a 
few days ago did you see my garden ?

oki na koe : a loud voice. 
okiku naru : to grow. 
okiku auru : to make bigger. 
Note. The polite form of the predicate of

bles ki-ft, but is a diphthong and pron. as 
if written kyu. The q. adj. oki no is never 
used predicatively ; it is, however, some- 
times, found in the adverbial form oki ni, 
especially in certain really polite or iron- 
ically polite expressions. Oi ni (see oi) is 
probably a corruption of oki ni.

wal. A ppn. that generally has an emphatic 
or contrasting effect ; it often seems to 
separate the words which precede it from 
the rest of the sentence. Though not in 
itself a sign of the nominative case, it is 
used more frequently after the subject than 
after the object. See 389-392 for a <-mn- 
parison of the use of wa and ga after UIH 
subject of a sentence,. 
1) After the subject. 
kore wa ginko desu (C) : this is a bank. 
tomodachi wa kind Tdkyd ni ikimashUa (C) : 

my friend went to Tokyo yesterday. 
anata wa gakko ni iku no de*u ka t (C) an- 

you going to school ? 
Note. As regards sentences like anata 
nakko desfi ka .' the author cannot K r<> " 
with the opinion of Prof. Chambertoui 
(Handbook of Colloquial Japan.-*.-. \>. > 
and Ballet (Grammairo JaponaiM da M 
langue parlee. p. W; !'" *'>' ' 
surd to call anata wa (you) th.- subject 
this sentence. If anata wa is not th.- rob- 
ject, what is the subject ? Th- tn.nsl.i- 
tion suggested at the result of this hypo- 
thesis, viz. 'are you a school ? 
course nonsense ; but if th.- fault 
; the subject, it ought to lx- NnaedttJ l-y 



wa 



148 



wa 



putting instead of 'you' the proper sub- 
ject : this cannot be done. It seems, 
therefore, that the subject is anata wa 
(you), but the predicate is elliptical : the 
full sentence is anata wa gakko ni iku no 
desu ka ? are you going to school ? The 
present writer is of opinion that, though 
wa is by no means of necessity the sign of 
the nominative case, in this particular 
instance it certainly is used after the 
subject of the sentence. 

2) After the object. 

tabako wa nomu ga sake wa noma-nai (B) : 
I smoke but I do not drink sake. 

sonna kitanai mono wa o sute nasai (B) : 
throw away a dirty thing like that. 

sara wa sara, chawan wa chawan to betsu na 
hako ni o ire nasai (B) : put the plates 
and the tea-cups in separate boxes. 

3) After nouns or adverbs denoting time or 
place. 

kyo wa o tenki desit (C) : it is fine weather 

today. 
Tokyo wa kono-goro atsui so de#u (C) : they 

say it has been hot in Tokyo lately. 

4) The separating effect is very noticeable 
in sentences like the following. 

shio wa, dono gurai mazatte imasu ka ? (C) : 
how much salt is there in this ? (I'm talk- 
ing of salt, how much is there in it ?). 

nashi wa. mono-oki ni arimasu ka ? (C) : 
are the pears in the pantry ? (I 'm talking 
of the pears, are they in the pantry ?). 

5) Contrast, expressed or implied. 

kore tea takai, are wa yasui (B) : this one is 

dear, that one cheap. 
watakushi wa mairimasu (D) : I shall go 

(others may go or not as they please). 
C) After the stem of a verb and followed by 

sum it is emphatic. When sum is in a 

neg. inflexion as it gen. is, wa may be 

corrupted to ya ; (see 47-49). 
iki wa (or ya) shi-nai (B) : I shall not go. 

7) After the stem of a verb followed by 
another inflexion of the same verb, it is 
also emphatic. 

yomi wa yomimashlta ga wakarimasen de- 
shlta (C) : oh yes, I did read it, but I did 
not understand it. 

8) In the above, the infinitive followed by 
koto or ni may take the place of the stem. 

yomu koto (or yomu ni) wa yomimashlia ga 
wakarimasen deshlta. 

9) There are three distinct uses of wa after a 
gerund : a) when the gerund is the first 
component of a verbal phrase, the wa has 
an emphatic force ; b) when the gerund 
(or adjective in gerundial form) is at the 
end of a clause, wa refers to a condition 
which may be put or has been put ; c) it 
sometimes means repetition. 

nete u-a i-nai (B) : oh no, he in not asleep. 



kotowatte wa okimashlta ga kitru ka mo shi- 
ronasen (C) : I certainly refused but he 
may come in spite of that. 

Yokohama e hikkoshite wa fuben de gozaf- 
masu (D) : it would be inconvenient for 
me to move to Yokohama, (if I were to 
move to Yokohama). 

benkyo shi-nakuie wa ike-nai (A) : you must 
study ; (if you don't study it won't do). 

omokute wa ikemasen (C) : it mustn't In- 
heavy. 

takakute wa kaema#en (C) : as it is dear, I 
can't buy it. 

so itte wa komaru (B) : if you say that you 
put me in a difficult position. 

ame ga futte wa komaru (B) : (a) if it rains 
I will be in a difficult position ; (b) as it is 
raining I find myself in a difficult position. 

itazura wo shite wa shikarareru (B) : (a) 
if you get up to mischief you '11 be scolded ; 
(b) he is often scolded as he is always up 
to mischief. 

For contr. of wa after a gerund, see below 
14). 

10) Wa is used in neg. sentences even more 
freely than in aff.; (crmp. 94). In neg. 
sentences it may be used after the adver- 
bial form of an adj. 

takaku wa nai (B) : it is not dear. 

11) Wa may be added to almost all the 
postpositions except ga. 

Tokyo ni wa arimasen (C) : there are none 

to be had in Tokyo. 
ano hlto no hanashi de wa : according to 

what that man says. 
See no 11), 12), 13) ; and to2 18). 

12) Wa is used in elliptical interrogative 
sentences with only a noun. 

inu wa ? (B) : how r about the dog ? what of 
the dog ? (This may mean : where is the 
dog ? has the dog recovered ? will you 
bring the dog with you ? or almost any- 
thing according to context and circum- 
stances). 

13) Observe the following examples in which 
wa has not merely an emphatic force l>ut 

changes the meaning considerably. 
minna miemasen (C) : I can't see any cf 

them. 

minna wa miemasen (C): I can 't see them all. 
omokute ikemasen (C) : it is too heavy. 
omokute wa ikemasen (C) : it mustn't be 

heavy. 

14) Contractions and corruptions. 

We have seen above in 6) that wa is some- 
times corrupted to ya. 

The final te of a gerund and wa are con- 
tracted to cha. Itte wa = itcha. 

The final de of a gerund and wa are con- 
tracted to /a. Yonde wa = yonia. 

Note also the following, which are riot given 
as a complete list, but rather as samples. 



wa

wake 



dewa = ja (very common). 
ni wa = nya. 
no wa~na. 
kondo wa = konda. 
son- wa = 8orya.

Comp.: fufu-wakarc : divorce. 
wakaru, [wake-ru to distinguish]. To under- 
stand ; know. 

Note. Wakaru is riot a transitive verb like 
the English 'to understand' : the object 
of the English verb becomes the subject 
of wakaru and takes the ppn. ga or wa ; 
the English subject, when expressed in 
Japanese, occasionally takes the ppn. ni, 
more frequently ni wa or simply wa ; but 
even in this latter case it is not the sub- 
ject of the Japanese verb. All this will be 
bettor understood when it is remembered 
that wakaru is probably a corruption of 
wakerare-ru to be distinguished, be classi- 
fied, be understood, pass, of wake-ru to 
distinguish. 

I'li-ijo ga wakarirnatten (C) : I (he, she, we,

omae wa itsii de tno ii-wake bakkari shite iru

she had put the starch ; 10 the starch 
itself was gone. 

" Oh ! what does this mean ? ;< 

J Thus (she spoke) ; 2 and while she 
was looking around, 3 she happened 
to see the sparrow that was in its cage 
over there. 

" Do you know anything about the 
starch that was here ?" 

" J Do you mean the starch that was 
in the bowl ? 2 If that (is what you 
are referring to), I ate it up."
