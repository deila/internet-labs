INTRODUCTION. 



I. REVOLUTIONARY RECORDS OF THE STATE. 

IN the compilation of the following Military and Naval record of Connecticut in the War of the 
Revolution, as called for by Act of the General Assembly approved April 13, 1887, various sources 
of information have been sought and examined. The original and official manuscripts bearing 
upon the history of that interesting period are, and long have been, in a more or less dispersed con 
ditiona fact true of the records of all the Thirteen States and in some instances the greater 
part has been either lost or destroyed. In the case of Connecticut, while certain gaps occur at 
intervals in the continuity of her Revolutionary Papers, the more valuable portions have fortunately 
been preserved and are deposited in permanent and accessible archives. Of this material, the State 
herself retains a considerable proportion, the Departments of the General Government at Washing 
ton contain much, and the remainder has passed by gift and purchase into the keeping of indi 
viduals, Societies, and Libraries throughout the country. For convenient reference the documents 
may be classified as follows : 

1. The original minutes of the proceedings of the General Assembly of Connecticut, covering 

the period of the war, on file in the office of the Secretary of State, Hartford. 

2. The original minutes of the proceedings of the Governor and Council, or Committee of 

War, covering the period of the war, on file in the State Library, Hartford. 

3. Pay-Rolls of the Connecticut Regiments in the Continental "Line" for certain years, and 

scattering pay -table accounts of State troops and militia, together with individual 
accounts, bound in twelve volumes, on file in the office of the State Comptroller, 
Hartford. 

4. Thirty-eight bound folio volumes, marked " Revolutionary War," covering a period of 

ten years or more from 1774, and containing numerous original rolls, letters, 
accounts, resolutions, petitions, town-lists, and similar material, unbound, on file in 
the State Library. 

5. Rolls, letters, and various documents bearing on the service of Connecticut troops, on file 

among the papers of General Washington in the Department of State, Washington, 
D. C. 

0. Forty-seven bound folio volumes, containing company and regimental muster and pay rolls 
of the regiments of the Connecticut "Line," together with numerous militia rolls and 
miscellaneous papers, and the large mass of applications for pensions, on file in the 
Pension Bureau, Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C. 

7. The "Trumbull Papers," consisting of twenty -two bound volumes, containing the official 
correspondence of Governor Jonathan Trumbull of Connecticut during the entire 
period of the war, inclusive also of many rolls and miscellaneous documents, in pos 
session of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston. 
2 (i) 



x CONNECTICUT IN THE REVOLUTION. 

8. Various Revolutionary papers, military and naval, in possession of the Connecticut 

Historical Society, Hartford. 

9. Forty or more Orderly Books, kept by Connecticut officers during the war, containing 

general, division, brigade, and regimental orders issued in camp and on the march, 
in the possession for the most part of individuals and Societies. 

10. Miscellaneous letters, rolls, maps, diaries, and other papers in the hands of descendants 
of Revolutionary soldiers, individuals, and collectors, or deposited in Libraries and 
State and Town archives. 

Supplementing these documents, and included among the authorities on which this work is 
based, must be mentioned the mass of original letters and papers which have found their way 
into print in such publications as Force s American Arch ires, the volumes issued by Historical 
Societies, magazines, genealogies, monographs, and Town histories. 



II. ARRANGEMENT OF THE ROLLS. 

The several rolls and lists in the following pages, compiled from the foregoing records, 
have been arranged chronologically according to the description of the service in which the 
troops engaged. Thus, after the first alarm, the Continental soldiers are classified in the order in 
which they were called out, then the State troops, and finally the Militia, with special lists following. 

The Lexington Alarm. The first lists in the record, grouped under the head of the "Out 
break of the War," include the names of the men who, under the provocation of the moment, 
marched to the relief of their Massachusetts neighbors in the Lexington Alarm. Some explanation 
of the nature of this service appears in the introductory text on pages 3 and 4. It will be observed 
that the forty-eight towns from which the companies set out represent, with three exceptions, the 
eastern and central counties, which were then the thickly settled sections of the State, the nearest 
to the point of danger, the best prepared for an emergency, and the most accessible in case of 
alarm. It may also be noticed that the four thousand townsmen who responded to the Lexington 
call were a representative body, largely descendants of original settlers, including all elements in 
the different communities, judges, pastors, lawyers, physicians, farmers, mechanics, sailors, labor 
ers, and that as a list of a respectable number of the male inhabitants of the State in 1775, which 
may be utilized in historical and genealogical researches, a peculiar interest attaches to it. Follow 
ing in their proper place are the names of the men engaged in the Ticonderoga enterprise. 

Continental Troops. Next in order have been arranged the rolls of the Connecticut quota of 
that part of the Revolutionary forces known as the " Continental " troops, which constituted the 
body of Washington s army in the field throughout the war. They stand first in importance, as 
explained on page IU, and as appears from their military history in the text introductory to the 
subdivisions A, B, C, and D, under which they have been classified. After the Lexington Alarm 
the State raised eight regiments, which were adopted as Continental, to serve to the close of the 
year 1775. She furnished eight for the year 1770, and eight, with a large additional quota, for the 
three years term from 1777 to 1781. Thereafter, from 17X1 to 1783, the numbers were reduced by 
consolidations. The rosters of these troops form a large portion of the record (pages 33 to 370), 
and with the exception of some of the rolls for 1775 and the greater part of those for 177G, are 
believed to be substantially complete. In view of the importance of the campaign of 1776, it is to 
be regretted that the rolls of seven of the Continental regiments for that year are missing. The 
names of very many of the men, however, appear on the rolls of 1775, when they served their first 
term, or on the rolls of 1777, when they re-enlisted for three years or the war, or again on the 
rolls of State troops and militia in subsequent years. In the absence of these lists the number of 
officers and soldiers that entered the Continental service from Connecticut during the war can only 
be approximately estimated; but it may be placed at about fifteen thousand. 



INTRODUCTION. Xl 

State Troops. tinder this heading appear a certain number of regiments which were neither 
Continental nor militia, but were raised mainly in the .early part of the war, to act as reinforce 
ments for the army in the field, for limited terms. Organized by authority of the State or the 
Governor, with the officers commissions signed by the Governor, they were designated as State 
troops, and at different periods rendered considerable service. 

The Militia. The third distinctive class of troops was the standing Militia of the State, 
whose rolls, so far as preserved, are arranged, like the preceding, in chronological order. Here 
again several serious gaps occur in the list, which is a special misfortune from a historical point 
of view, inasmuch as the militia represented the greater part of the male population of the State. 
The rolls here published, however, represent a fair proportion of the regiments and men that were 
called into active service. From the return, as given on page 447, for the year 1782, it may be 
inferred that the number of effective militia varied during the years of the war from twenty-two 
to twenty-five thousand. 

Miscellaneous Rolls. The closing pages of the work contain such portions of the Naval 
record of Connecticut as have been preserved among the documents, also unclassified lists of 
minutemen, volunteers, independent companies, and individual officers and soldiers, and copies 
of the Pension lists as published in Congressional and Government documents at various periods 
since the war. 

In compiling and arranging the rolls, as grouped above, a limited amount of explanatory 
text has been inserted, showing where and for what terms the troops served. It has been possible 
to do this with a satisfactory degree of accuracy in the case of the regiments of the Continental 
" Line," and on pages 125-140 and 301-311 may be found an outline of their organization and serv 
ice generally battles, encampments, itinerary, and formations which has been prepared from 
original letters and Order-books. An introductory note also appears before each regimental roster. 
In the case of many of the militia regiments and detachments, no record of service has been found. 

The publication of this work will doubtless lead to the production or discovery of missing 
documents, including rolls of entire regiments, companies, or the record of individuals, which it 
may be desirable to issue in supplementary form in the future. It is especially requested that the 
originals or copies of these may be forwarded to the Adjutant-General of Connecticut at Hartford. 

III. RELATION OF THE STATE TO THE WAR. 

The number of separate names in the following lists, as arranged in the Index, reaches a 
total of twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and twenty -three. In a few cases, probably, through 
different spelling of names, the same individual has been entered more than once. On the other 
hand, it is to be observed that in numerous cases the same name represents different individuals. 
Thus, in the Lexington Alarm list, the William Lyon, of New Haven, could not have been the 
William Lyon of Woodstock, nor Lieut. William Adams, of the Fourth "Connecticut Line" for 
1777-81, be either of the privates of the same name in his regiment. In the Index, however, these 
five individuals count only as two William Lyon and William Adams. The identity of others, 
owing to the absence of a "residence" column in many of the rolls, cannot always be distin 
guished. From these circumstances it is evidently impossible to give the exact number of different 
individuals of whom some record has been entered. A total of thirty thousand may be 
accepted as a reasonable estimate. Of this number some ten thousand represent Continental 
soldiers men who had enlisted for long terms and served in the field outside of the State 
under Washington s immediate command. A complete record, as already indicated, would em 
brace several thousand additional names, especially of the militia. From expressions used 
by Governor Trumbull in his correspondence, the wording of the calls for temporary service, 
and the make-up of town militia lists, it is apparent that, barring a small loyalist element 
in the western part of the State, nearly every able-bodied man in Connecticut rendered, or 



Ill 



CONNECTICUT IN THE REVOLUTION. 



was enrolled as notified and prepared to render, some kind of service during the Revolutionary 
War. The exposed situation of the State, with her entire coast subject to incursions and ravages 
by the enemy and her proximity to the several fields of operations in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
and New York, required her to remain in a constant state of preparation. On this account, and 
because of the size of her population, then relatively large, she was regarded as one of the four 
strong States supporting the cause, ranking in capacity next after Massachusetts, Virginia, and 
Pennsylvania. How far the State was represented with her neighbors in the fortunes of the war, 
sharing with them both success and defeat, is a matter of general history, confirmed by the record 
in the following pages, from which it appears that after the Lexington Alarm, Connecticut troops 
participated in all the principal battles, with the exception of those fought in the extreme Southern 
field. They were present and engaged at the

A. THE LEXINGTON ALARM. 




r HE Revolutionary record of Connecticut opens with her response to the historic Lexington 
alarm of April 19, 1775, and closes eight years and a half later with the disbandment, 
after the Peace, of her last regiment in the field, in November, 1783. 

The attitude assumed by the colonists at the beginning of the struggle was that of vigilance 
and self-defense. Alarmed by the determination of the home government, openly declared within 
recent years, to establish its authority more firmly in America, they entered vigorous protests against 
the new policy as tending to endanger certain privileges of their own, assured to them by charter or 
long enjoyment. While differing somewhat from each other, either in creed, temperament, descent, or 
manners, the people in the several colonies, or the great majority of them, stood politically, in 1775, 
on the common platform of non-interference in their local affairs. They advocated home-rule com 
bined with loyalty to the general interests of the British Empire, which, in effect, represents the 
relations existing between England and her larger dependencies at the present day. In this sense the 
cause of any one of the American colonies was the cause of all. An attempt upon the privileges 
of one was a threat against all. An alarm sounded in one locality was bound to spread by common 
sympathy to every other. 

In Connecticut, especially in her eastern section, this colonial spirit took deep root, and when 
Massachusetts, in 1774, was made the subject of restrictive measures by the home ministry, general 
indignation was aroused. As the possibility of a collision became apparent town meetings were held, 
contributions of money and provisions were voted for the distressed inhabitants of Boston, whose 
port had been closed by act of Parliament, non-intercourse with British merchants advised, a gen 
eral congress representing all the colonies proposed, and Committees of Correspondence appointed 
to circulate all news of importance. A convention of delegates from the two counties of New 
London and Windham, held at Norwich, September 8, 1774, went further and recommended their 
towns to keep up their stock of ammunition and attend to the exercise of the train-bands. In the 
Assembly of the Colony, which in May, 1774, adopted resolutions protesting against the recent acts 
of Parliament touching America, the drift of events was so far recognized, that, in October, it 
required the selectmen of the towns to provide a double quantity of "powder, balls, and flint," and 
in January, 1775, ordered the entire militia to muster and drill once a week during the three months 
following. The situation was characterized as " an alarming crisis." 

The crisis culminated on April 10, 1775. A detachment of British troops marching out from 
Boston to seize military stores alleged to have been collected at Concord for hostile purposes, was 
met upon the road by the Provincials and a bloody encounter took place. The since famous skir 
mishes of Lexington and Concord were fought, which precipitated the Revolutionary War. An 
"alarm" was immediately spread in every direction, so that on the 27th of April it had reached the 
principal points as far as Baltimore, and by the llth of May was posted at Charleston, S. C. 
Throughout New England the news was rapidly carried by horse "expresses" from town to town. 
It was dispatched to Connecticut by the Massachusetts Committee of Safety at Watertown during 
the progress of the fighting, or "near ten o clock" of Wednesday morning, April 19th: "The bearer, 
Israel Bessel, is charged to alarm the country quite to Connecticut, and all persons are desired to 
furnish him with fresh horses as they may be needed." During Thursday, the 20th, the news was 
circulating through the eastern part of the Colony. The people of Windham County received it

generally by noon. It reached Governor Trurnbull at Lebanon not long after. It was doubtless at 
Hartford before night ; at New Haven on the following evening, Friday, the 21st, and forwarded 
from there through Fairfield and Stamford to New York. 

Prepared to a certain extent for such an alarm, a large number of able-bodied men in Con 
necticut hurried off to Massachusetts. The wording used in the records of the day, " marched for the 
relief of Boston," expresses alike the extent of their sympathies and the nature of the service 
intended. The response to the alarm was not the official action of the Colony, nor, on the other 
hand, an impromptu movement ?f individuals without previous organization. An "uprising" of 
armed men might have partaken of a mob character, and the militia regiments as such could only 
be called out by the governor or legislature. It was rather a movement of the townsmen marching 
under their militia organizations. The gathering thus became orderly as well as spontaneous, 
and represented the town spirit shown previously in protests and resolutions. It appears from 
the records that in some cases the companies or train-bands collected and marched off under their 
officers without further orders : in other cases, the colonels taking the lead, called out a certain 
number of their men and directed them to march forthwith to the point of danger ; in a few cases 
volunteer companies were organized for the special service ; in addition, many individuals, not be 
longing to the militia, joined in the march, either providing for themselves or going with the com 
panies. Colonel Williams of the llth Regiment, sends out word on the 20th, "that it will be 
expedient for every man to go who is fit and willing." A letter dated Wethersfield, April 2.3d, de 
scribes the scene there as follows : " We are all in motion here, and equipt from the Town yester 
day, one hundred young men. who cheerfully offered their service, twenty-days provision and 
sixty -four rounds per man. They are all well armed and in high spirits. My brother has gone with 
them and others of the first property. Our neighboring towns are all arming and moving. Men of 
the first character shoulder their arms and march off for the field of action. We shall by night 

have several thousands from this Colony on their march We fix on our Standards and 

Drnms the Colony arms, with the motto qui transtulit sustinet, round it in letters of gold, which 
we construe thus : God, who transplanted us hither, will support us. Writing from Wallingford, 
April 24th, Mr. James Lockwood says : "Col. Wadsworth was over at this place most of yesterday 
and has ordered twenty men out of each Company of his Regiment, some of which had .already set 
off and others go this morning. . . . The Country beyond here are all gone." Nor were the 
Colony officials inactive. Upon receiving "the tragical narrative" from Massachusetts, Gov. 
Trumbull issued writs for a special meeting of the Assembly on the 20th, and the general Committee 
of Correspondence sent prompt assurance of assistance to President Hancock of the Massachusetts 
Provincial Congress. Writing from Lebanon on the 21st, the Committee say: "Every preparation 
is making to support your Province. . . . The ardour of our people is such that they can t be 
kept back. The Colonels are to forward part of the best men and the most ready, as fast as possi 
ble, the remainder to be ready at a moment s warning. These are the present movements with us." 

The number of men who are reported in the records to have marched in the Lexington alarm 
was about four thousand. The duty was necessarily temporary and brief. Some of the companies 
returned home before reaching Boston, as their presence was not needed. Upon the organization of 
regiments for service during the year, many of the same men enlisted and continued for different 
terms during the war. At the May session of the Legislature their service was recognized and the 
men paid for the time as given on the following lists, the originals of which are on file in the State 
Library, Rev. War, Vol. If.
