The Practice of Optimism 53 



t 




aOULD we choose our envi- 
ronment, and were desire in 
human undertakings synon- 
ymous with endowment, all men 
would, I suppose, be optimists. Cer- 
tainly most of us regard happiness 
as the proper end of all earthly en- 
terprise. The will to be happy ani- 
mates alike the philosopher, the 
prince and the chimney-sweep. No 
matter how dull, or how mean, or 
how wise a man is, he feels that hap- 
piness is his indisputable right. 
It is curious to observe what differ- 

ii 



>ptimf$m 



ent ideals of happiness people cher- 
ish, and in what singular places they 
look for this well-spring of their life. 
Many look for it in the hoarding of 
riches, some in the pride of power, 
and others in the achievements of 
art and literature ; a few seek it in 
the exploration of their own minds, 
or in the search for knowledge. 

Most people measure their happi- 
ness in terms of physical pleasure 
and material possession. Could they 
win some visible goal which they 
have set on the horizon, how happy 
they would be ! Lacking this gift or 
that circumstance, they would be 
miserable. If happiness is to be so 
measured, I who cannot hear or see 
have every reason to sit in a corner 
with folded hands and weep. If I am 
happy in spite of my deprivations, if 
my happiness is so deep that it is a 
faith, so thoughtful that it becomes 
a philosophy of life, -if, in short, I 
12 



am an optimist, my testimony to the 
creed of optimism is worth hearing. 
As sinners stand up in meeting and 
testify to the goodness of God, so one 
who is called afflicted may rise up in 
gladness of conviction and testify to 
the goodness of life. 

Once I knew the depth where no 
hope was, and darkness lay on the 
face of all things. Then love came 
and set my soul free. Once I knew 
only darkness and stillness. Now I 
know hope and joy. Once I fretted 
and beat myself against the wall that 
shut me in. Now I rejoice in the con- 
sciousness that I can think, act and 
attain heaven. My life was without 
past or future ; death, the pessimist 
would say, "a consummation de- 
voutly to be wished." But a little 
word from the fingers of another fell 
into my hand that clutched at empti- 
ness, and my heart leaped to the rap- 
ture of living. Night fled before the 

13 



day of thought, and love and joy and 
hope came up in a passion of obedi- 
ence to knowledge. Can any one who 
has escaped such captivity, who has 
felt the thrill and glory of freedom, 
be a pessimist? 

My early experience was thus a 
leap from bad to good. If I tried, I 
could not check the momentum of 
my first leap out of the dark ; to move 
breast forward is a habit learned sud- 
denly at that first moment of release 
and rush into the light. With the first 
word I used intelligently, I learned 
to live, to think, to hope. Darkness 
cannot shut me in again. I have had 
a glimpse of the shore, and can now 
live by the hope of reaching it. 

So my optimism is no mild and un- 
reasoning satisfaction. A poet once 
said I must be happy because I did 
not see the bare, cold present, but 
lived in a beautiful dream. I do live 
in a beautiful dream ; but that dream 
14 



is the actual, the present, not cold, 
but warm; not bare, but furnished 
with a thousand blessings. The very 
evil which the poet supposed would 
be a cruel disillusionment is neces- 
sary to the fullest knowledge of joy. 
Only by contact with evil could I 
have learned to feel by contrast the 
beauty of truth and love and good- 
ness. 

It is a mistake always to contem- 
plate the good and ignore the evil, 
because by making people neglect- 
ful it lets in disaster. There is a dan- 
gerous optimism of ignorance and 
indifference. It is not enough to say 
that the twentieth century is the 
best age in the history of mankind, 
and to take refuge from the evils of 
the world in skyey dreams of good. 
How many good men, prosperous 
and contented, looked around and 
saw naught but good, while millions 
of their fell owmen were bartered and 

15 



>pttmtem 



sold like cattle! No doubt, there were 
comfortable optimists who thought 
Wilberforce a meddlesome fanatic 
when he was working with might 
and main to free the slaves. I dis- 
trust the rash optimism in this coun- 
try that cries, " Hurrah, we're all 
right ! This is the greatest nation on 
earth," when there are grievances 
that call loudly for redress. That is 
false optimism. Optimism that does 
not count the cost is like a house 
builded on sand. A man must under- 
stand evil and be acquainted with 
sorrow before he can write himself 
an optimist and expect others to be- 
lieve that he has reason for the faith 
that is in him. 

I know what evil is. Once or twice 
I have wrestled with it, and for a time 
felt its chilling touch on my life ; so 
I speak with knowledge when I say 
that evil is of no consequence, ex- 
cept as a sort of mental gymnastic. 
16 



For the very reason that I have come 
in contact with it, I am more truly an 
optimist. I can say with conviction 
that the struggle which evil neces- 
sitates is one of the greatest bless- 
ings. It makes us strong, patient, 
helpful men and women. It lets us 
into the soul of things and teaches 
us that although the world is full of 
suffering, it is full also of the over- 
coming of it. My optimism, then, does 
not rest on the absence of evil, but 
on a glad belief in the preponderance 
of good and a willing effort always 
to cooperate with the good, that it 
may prevail. I try to increase the 
power God has given me to see the 
best in everything and every one, 
and make that Best a part of my life. 
The world is sown with good; but 
unless I turn my glad thoughts into 
practical living and till my own field, 
I cannot reap a kernel of the good. 
Thus my optimism is grounded in 

17 



two worlds, myself and what is about 
me. I demand that the world be good, 
and lo, it obeys. I proclaim the world 
good, and facts range themselves to 
prove my proclamation overwhelm- 
ingly true. To what is good I open 
the doors of my being, and jealously 
shut them against what is bad. Such 
is the force of this beautiful and wil- 
ful conviction, it carries itself in the 
face of all opposition. I am never dis- 
couraged by absence of good. I never 
can be argued into hopelessness. 
Doubt and mistrust are the mere 
panic of timid imagination, which 
the steadfast heart will conquer, and 
the large mind transcend. 

As my college days draw to a close, 
I find myself looking forward with 
beating heart and bright anticipa- 
tions to what the future holds of ac- 
tivity for me. My share in the work 
of the world may be limited ; but the 
fact that it is work makes it precious. 
18 



Nay, the desire and will to work is 
optimism itself. 

Two generations ago Carlyle flung 
forth his gospel of work. To the 
dreamers of the Revolution, who 
built cloud-castles of happiness, and, 
when the inevitable winds rent the 
castles asunder, turned pessimists 
to those ineffectual Endymions, 
Alastors and Werthers, this Scots 
peasant, man of dreams in the hard, 
practical world, cried aloud his creed 
of labor. "Be no longer a Chaos, but 
a World. Produce ! produce ! Were it 
but the pitifullest infinitesimal frac- 
tion of a product, produce it, in God's 
name! 'Tis the utmost thou hast in 
thee ; out with it, then. Up, up ! what- 
soever thy hand findeth to do, do it 
with thy whole might. Work while 
itiscalledTo-day;forthe Night com- 
eth wherein no man may work." 

Some have said Carlyle was tak- 
ing refuge from a hard world by bid- 

19 



ding men grind and toil, eyes to the 
earth, and so forget their misery. 
This is not Carlyle's thought. ' ' Fool ! " 
he cries, "the Ideal is in thyself; the 
Impediment is also in thyself. Work 
out the Ideal in the poor, miserable 
Actual; live, think, believe, and be 
free!" It is plain what he says, that 
work, production, brings life out of 
chaos, makes the individual a world, 
an order; and order is optimism. 

I, too, can work, and because I love 
to labor with my head and my hands, 
I am an optimist in spite of all. I used 
to think I should be thwarted in my 
desire to do something useful. But 
I have found out that though the 
ways in which I can make myself 
useful are few, yet the work open to 
me is endless. The gladdest laborer 
in the vineyard may be a cripple. 
Even should the others outstrip him, 
yet the vineyard ripens in the sun 
each year, and the full clusters weigh 
20 



into his hand. Darwin could work 
only half an hour at a time ; yet in 
many diligent half-hours he laid 
anew the foundations of philosophy. 
I long to accomplish a great and no- 
ble task; but it is my chief duty and 
joy to accomplish humble tasks as 
though they were great and noble. 
It is my service to think how I can 
best fulfil the demands that each day 
makes upon me, and to rejoice that 
others can do what I cannot. Green, 
the historian, 1 tells us that the world 
is moved along, not only by the 
mighty shoves of its heroes, but also 
by the aggregate of the tiny pushes 
of each honest worker; and that 
thought alone suffices to guide me in 
this dark world and wide. I love the 
good that others do ; for their activity 
is an assurance that whether I can 
help or not, the true and the good

will stand sure. 

I trust, and nothing that happens 
disturbs my trust. I recognize the 
beneficence of the power which we 
all worship as supreme Order, Fate, 
the Great Spirit, Nature, God. I re- 
cognize this power in the sun that 
makes all things grow and keeps life 
afoot. I make a friend of this inde- 
finable force, and straightway I feel 
glad, brave and ready for any lot 
Heaven may decree for me. This is 
my religion of optimism.

OPTIMISM, then, is a fact 
within my own heart. But as 
I look out upon life, my heart 
meets no contradiction. The out- 
ward world justifies my inward uni- 
verse of good. All through the years 
I have spent in college, my reading 
has been a continuous discovery of 
good. In literature, philosophy, reli- 
gion and history I find the mighty 
witnesses to my faith. 

Philosophy is the history of a deaf- 
blind person writ large. From the 
talks of Socrates up through Plato, 

25 



Berkeley and Kant, philosophy re- 
cords the efforts of human intelli- 
gence to be free of the clogging 
material world and fly forth into a 
universe of pure idea. A deaf-blind 
person ought to find special mean- 
ing in Plato's Ideal World. These 
things which you see and hear and 
touch are not the reality of realities, 
but imperfect manifestations of the 
Idea, the Principle, the Spiritual ;the 
Idea is the truth, the rest is delusion. 
If this be so, my brethren who 
enjoy the fullest use of the senses 
are not aware of any reality which 
may not equally well be in reach of 
my mind. Philosophy gives to the 
mind the prerogative of seeing truth, 
and bears us into a realm where I, 
who am blind, am not different from 
you who see. When I learned from 
Berkeley that your eyes receive an 
inverted image of things which your 
brain unconsciously corrects, I be- 
26 



gan to suspect that the eye is not a 
very reliable instrument after all, and 
I felt as one who had been restored 
to equality with others, glad, not be- 
cause the senses avail them so little, 
but because in God's eternal world, 
mind and spirit avail so much. It 
seemed to me that philosophy had 
been written for my special conso- 
lation, whereby I get even with some 
modern philosophers who appar- 
ently think that I was intended as 
an experimental case for their spe- 
cial instruction ! But in a little mea- 
sure my small voice of individual ex- 
perience does join in the declaration 
of philosophy that the good is the 
only world, and that world is a world 
of spirit. It is also a universe where 
order is All, where an unbroken logic 
holds the parts together, where dis- 
order defines itself as non-existence, 
where evil, as St. Augustine held, is 
delusion, and therefore is not. 

27

The meaning of philosophy to me 
is not only in its principles, but also 
in the happy isolation of its great 
expounders. They were seldom of 
the world, even when like Plato and 
Leibnitz they moved in its courts 
and drawing-rooms. To the tumult 
of life they were deaf, and they were 
blind to its distraction and perplex- 
ing diversities. Sitting alone, but not 
in darkness, they learned to find 
everything in themselves, and fail- 
ing to find it even there, they still 
trusted in meeting the truth face to 
face when they should leave the earth 
behind and become partakers in the 
wisdom of God. The great mystics 
lived alone, deaf and blind, but dwell- 
ing with God. 

I understand how it was possible 
for Spinoza to find deep and sus- 
tained happiness when he was ex- 
communicated, poor, despised and 
suspected alike by Jew and Chris- 
28 



tian; not that the kind world of men 
ever treated me so, but that his iso- 
lation from the universe of sensuous 
joys is somewhat analogous to mine. 
He loved the good for its own sake. 
Like many great spirits he accepted 
his place in the world, and confided 
himself childlike to a higher power, 
believing that it worked through his 
hands and predominated in his be- 
ing. He trusted implicitly, and that 
is what I do. Deep, solemn optimism, 
it seems to me, should spring from 
this firm belief in the presence of 
God in the individual ; not a remote, 
unapproachable governor of the uni- 
verse, but a God who is very near 
every one of us, who is present not 
only in earth, sea and sky, but also in 
every pure and noble impulse of our 
hearts, "the source and centre of all 
minds, their only point of rest." 

Thus from philosophy I learn that 
we see only shadows and know only 

29 



in part, and that all things change ; 
but the mind, the unconquerable 
mind, compasses all truth, embraces 
the universe as it is, converts the 
shadows to realities and makes tu- 
multuous changes seem but mo- 
ments in an eternal silence, or short 
lines in the infinite theme of perfec- 
tion, and the evil but "a halt on the 
way to good. "Though with my hand 
I grasp only a small part of the uni- 
verse, with my spirit I see the whole, 
and in my thought I can compass 
the beneficent laws by which it is 
governed. The confidence and trust 
which these conceptions inspire 
teach me to rest safe in my life as in 
a fate, and protect me from spectral 
doubts and fears. Verily, blessed are 
ye that have not seen, and yet have 
believed. 

All the world's great philosophers 
have been lovers of God and believers 
in man's inner goodness. To know 
30 



the history of philosophy is to know 
that the highest thinkers of the ages, 
the seers of the tribes and the na- 
tions, have been optimists. 

The growth of philosophy is the 
story of man's spiritual life. Outside 
lies that great mass of events which 
we call History. As I look on this 
mass, I see it take form and shape 
itself in the ways of God. The history 
of man is an epic of progress. In the 
world within and the world without 
I see a wonderful correspondence, 
a glorious symbolism which reveals 
the human and the divine commun- 
ing together, the lesson of philoso- 
phy repeated in fact. In all the parts 
that compose the history of mankind 
hides the spirit of good, and gives 
meaning to the whole. 

Far back in the twilight of his- 
tory I see the savage fleeing from 
the forces of nature which he has 
not learned to control, and seeking 

31 



to propitiate supernatural beings 
which are but the creation of his 
superstitious fear. With a shift of 
imagination I see the savage eman- 
cipated, civilized. He no longer wor- 
ships the grim deities of ignorance. 
Through suffering he has learned to 
build a roof over his head, to defend 
his life and his home, and over his 
state he has erected a temple in 
which he worships the joyous gods 
of light and song. From suffering he 
has learned justice; from the strug- 
gle with his fellows he has learned 
the distinction between right and 
wrong which makes him a moral be- 
ing. He is gifted with the genius of 
Greece. 

But Greece was not perfect. Her 
poetical and religious ideals were 
far above her practice ; therefore she 
died, that her ideals might survive 
to ennoble coming ages. 

Rome, too, left the world a rich in- 
32 



heritance. Through the vicissitudes 
of history her laws and ordered gov- 
ernment have stood a majestic ob- 
ject-lesson for the ages. But when 
the stern, frugal character of herpeo- 
ple ceased to be the bone and sinew 
of her civilization, Rome fell. 

Then came the new nations of the 
North and founded a more permanent 
society. The base of Greek and Ro- 
man society was the slave, crushed 
into the condition of the wretches 
who "labored, foredone, in the field 
and at the workshop, like haltered 
horses, if blind, so much the quieter." 
The base of the new society was the 
freeman who fought, tilled, judged 
and grew from more to more. He 
wrought a state out of tribal kinship 
and fostered an independence and 
self-reliance which no oppression 
could destroy. The story of man's 
slow ascent from savagery through 
barbarism and self-mastery to civi- 

33 



lization is the embodiment of the 
spirit of optimism. From the first 
hour of the new nations each cen- 
tury has seen a better Europe, until 
the development of the world de- 
manded America. 

Tolstoi said the other day that 
America, once the hope of the world, 
was in bondage to Mammon. Tolstoi 
and other Europeans have still much 
to learn about this great, free coun- 
try of ours before they understand 
the unique civic struggle which 
America is undergoing. She is con- 
fronted with the mighty task of as- 
similating all the foreigners that are 
drawn together from every country, 
and welding them into one people 
with one national spirit. We have 
the right to demand the forbearance 
of critics until the United States has 
demonstrated whether she can make 
one people out of all the nations of 
the earth. London economists are 
34 



alarmed at less than five hundred 
thousand foreign-born in a popula- 
tion of six million, and discuss earn- 
estly the danger of too many aliens. 
But what is their problem in compar- 
ison with that of New York, which 
counts nearly one million five hun- 
dred thousand foreigners among its 
three and a half million citizens? 
Think of it! Every third person in 
our American metropolis is an alien. 
By these figures alone America's 
greatness can be measured. 

It is true, America has devoted her- 
self largely to the solution of mate- 
rial problems -breaking the fields, 
opening mines, irrigating deserts, 
spanning the continent with rail- 
roads ; but she is doing these things 
in a new way, by educating her peo- 
ple, by placing at the service of every 
man's need every resource of human 
skill. She is transmuting her indus- 
trial wealth into the education of her 

35 



flHitljout 



workmen, so that unskilled people 
shall have no place in American life, 
so that all men shall bring mind and 
soul to the control of matter. Her 
children are not drudges and slaves. 
The Constitution has declared it, and 
the spirit of our institutions has con- 
firmed it.The best the land can teach 
them they shall know. They shall 
learn that there is no upper class 
in their country, and no lower, and 
they shall understand how it is that 
God and His world are for everybody. 
America might do all this, and still 
be selfish, still be a worshipper of 
Mammon. But Americais the home of 
charity as well as of commerce. In the 
midst of roaring traffic, side by side 
with noisy factory and sky-reach- 
ing warehouse, one sees the school, 
the library, the hospital, the park- 
works of public benevolence which 
represent wealth wrought into ideas 
that shall endure forever. Behold 
36 



what America has already done to 
alleviate suffering and restore the 
afflicted to society -given sight to 
the fingers of the blind, language to 
the dumb lip, and mind to the idiot 
clay, and tell me if indeed she wor- 
ships Mammon only. Who shall mea- 
sure the sympathy, skill and intelli- 
gence with which she ministers to 
all who come to her, and lessens the 
ever-swelling tide of poverty, misery 
and degradation which every year 
rolls against her gates from all the 
nations? 

When I reflect on all these facts, 
I cannot but think that, Tolstoi and 
other theorists to the contrary, it is 
a splendid thing to be an American. 
In America the optimist finds abun- 
dant reason for confidence in the 
present and hope for the future, and 
this hope, this confidence, may well 
extend over all the great nations of 
the earth. 

37 



If we compare our own time with 
the past, we find in modern statistics 
a solid foundation for a confident and 
buoyant world-optimism. Beneath 
the doubt, the unrest, the material- 
ism, which surround us still glows 
and burns at the world's best life a 
steadfast faith. To hear the pessi- 
mist, one would think civilization 
had bivouacked in the Middle Ages, 
and had not had marching orders 
since. He does not realize that the 
progress of evolution is not an unin- 
terrupted march. 

"Now touching goal, now backward hurl'd, 
Toils the indomitable world." 

I have recently read an address by 
one whose knowledge it would be 
presumptuous to challenge. 1 In it I 
find abundant evidence of progress. 

During the past fifty years crime 
has decreased. True, the records of 

1 Address by the Hon. Carroll D. Wright before the 
Unitarian Conference, September, 1903. 

38 



to-day contain a longer list of crime. 
But our statistics are more complete 
and accurate than the statistics of 
times past. Besides, there are many 
offences on the list which half a 
century ago would not have been 
thought of as crimes. This shows 
that the public conscience is more 
sensitive than it ever was. 

Our definition of crime has grown 
stricter, our punishment of it more 
lenient and intelligent. The old feel- 
ing of revenge has largely disap- 
peared. It is no longer an eye for an 
eye, a tooth for a tooth. The criminal 
is treated as one who is diseased. He 
is confined not merely for punish- 
ment, but because he is a menace to 
society. While he is under restraint, 
he is treated with humane care and 
disciplined so that his mind shall be 
cured of its disease, and he shall be 
restored to society able to do his part 
of its work. 

39

Another sign of awakened and en- 
lightened public conscience is the 
effort to provide the working-class 
with better houses. Did it occur to 
any one a hundred years ago to think 
whether the dwellings of the poor 
were sanitary, convenient or sunny? 
Do not forget that in the "good old 
times" cholera and typhus devas- 
tated whole counties, and that pesti- 
lence walked abroad in the capitals 
of Europe. 

Not only have our laboring-classes 
better houses and better places to 
work in; but employers recognize 
the right of the employed to seek 
more than the bare wage of exis- 
tence. In the darkness and turmoil 
of our modern industrial strifes we 
discern but dimly the principles that 
underlie the struggle. The recogni- 
tion of the right of all men to life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness, 
a spirit of conciliation such as Burke 
40 



dreamed of, the willingness on the 
part of the strong to make conces- 
sions to the weak, the realization 
that the rights of the employer are 
bound up in the rights of the em- 
ployed -in these the optimist be- 
holds the signs of our times. 

Another right which the State 
has recognized as belonging to each 
man is the right to an education. In 
the enlightened parts of Europe and 
in America every city, every town, 
every village, has its school ; and it 
is no longer a class who have access 
to knowledge, for to the children of 
the poorest laborer the school-door 
stands open. From the civilized na- 
tions universal education is driving 
the dull host of illiteracy. 

Education broadens to include all 
men, and deepens to reach all truths. 
Scholars are no longer confined to 
Greek, Latin and mathematics, but 
they also study science ; and science 

41 



mtt^out 



converts the dreams of the poet, the 
theory of the mathematician and the 
fiction of the economist into ships, 
hospitals and instruments that en- 
able one skilled hand to perform the 
work of a thousand. The student of 
to-day is not asked if he has learned 
his grammar. Is he a mere grammar- 
machine, adry catalogue of scientific 
facts, or has he acquired the quali- 
ties of manliness? His supreme les- 
son is to grapple with great public 
questions, to keep his mind hospi- 
table to new ideas and new views of 
truth, to restore the finer ideals that 
are lost sight of in the struggle for 
wealth and to promote justice be- 
tween man and man. He learns that 
there may be substitutes for human 
labor horse-power and machinery 
and books ; but "there are no substi- 
tutes for common sense, patience, 
integrity, courage." 
Who can doubt the vastness of the 
42 



achievements of education when one 
considers how different the condi- 
tion of the blind and the deaf is from 
what it was a century ago? They 
were then objects of superstitious 
pity, and shared the lowest beg- 
gar's lot. Everybody looked upon 
their case as hopeless, and this view 
plunged them deeper in despair. The 
blind themselves laughed in the face 
of Haiiy when he offered to teach 
them to read. How pitiable is the 
cramped sense of imprisonment in 
circumstances which teaches men to 
expect no good and to treat any at- 
tempt to relieve them as the vagary 
of a disordered mind ! But now, be- 
hold the transformation ; see how in- 
stitutions and industrial establish- 
ments for the blind have sprung up 
as if by magic ; see how many of the 
deaf have learned not only to read 
and write, but to speak ; and remem- 
ber that the faith and patience of Dr. 

43 



Howe have borne fruit in the efforts 
that are being made everywhere to 
educate the deaf-blind and equip 
them for the struggle. Do you won- 
der that I am full of hope and lifted 
up? 

The highest result of education is 
tolerance. Long ago men fought and 
died for their faith ; but it took ages 
to teach them the other kind of cour- 
age, the courage to recognize the 
faiths of their brethren and their 
rights of conscience. Tolerance is 
the first principle of community; it 
is the spirit which conserves the best 
that all men think. No loss by flood 
and lightning, no destruction of cit- 
ies and temples by the hostile forces 
of nature, has deprived man of so 
many noble lives and impulses as 
those which his intolerance has de- 
stroyed. 

With wonder and sorrow I go back 
in thought to the ages of intolerance 
44

and bigotry. I see Jesus received with 
scorn and nailed on the cross. I see 
his followers hounded and tortured 
and burned. I am present where the 
finer spirits that revolt from the su- 
perstition of the Middle Ages are ac- 
cused of impiety and stricken down. 
I behold the children of Israel re- 
viled and persecuted unto death by 
those who pretend Christianity with 
the tongue ; I see them driven from 
land to land, hunted from refuge 
to refuge, summoned to the felon's 
place, exposed to the whip, mocked 
as they utter amid the pain of mar- 
tyrdom a confession of the faith 
which they have kept with such 
splendid constancy. The same bigo- 
try that oppresses the Jews falls 
tiger-like upon Christian noncon- 
formists of purest lives and wipes 
out the Albigenses and the peaceful 
Vaudois, "whose bones lie on the 
mountains cold." I see the clouds 

45 



part slowly, and I hear a cry of pro- 
test against the bigot. The restrain- 
ing hand of tolerance is laid upon the 
inquisitor, and the humanist utters a 
message of peace to the persecuted. 
Instead of the cry, "Burn the here- 
tic ! " men study the human soul with 
sympathy, and there enters into their 
hearts a new reverence for that 
which is unseen. 

The idea of brotherhood redawns 
upon the world with a broader sig- 
nificance than the narrow associa- 
tion of members in a sect or creed ; 
and thinkers of great soul like Les- 
sing challenge the world to say 
which is more godlike, the hatred 
and tooth-and-nail grapple of con- 
flicting religions, or sweet accord 
and mutual helpfulness. Ancient pre- 
judice of man against his brother- 
man wavers and retreats before the 
radiance of a more generous senti- 
ment, which will not sacrifice men to 
46 



forms, or rob them of the comfort and 
strength they find in their own be- 
liefs. The heresy of one age becomes 
the orthodoxy of the next. Mere tol- 
erance has given place to a senti- 
ment of brotherhood between sin- 
cere men of all denominations. The 
optimist rejoices in the affectionate 
sympathy between Catholic heart 
and Protestant heart which finds a 
gratifying expression in the univer- 
sal respect and warm admiration for 
Leo XIII on the part of good men 
the world over. The centenary cele- 
brations of the births of Emerson 
and Channing are beautiful exam- 
ples of the tribute which men of all 
creeds pay to the memory of a pure 
soul. 

Thus in my outlook upon our times 
I find that I am glad to be a citizen 
of the world, and as I regard my 
country, I find that to be an Ameri- 
can is to be an optimist. I know the 

47 



unhappy and unrighteous story of 
what has been done in the Philip- 
pines beneath our flag; but I believe 
that in the accidents of statecraft the 
best intelligence of the people some- 
times fails to express itself. I read in 
the history of Julius Caesar that dur- 
ing the civil wars there were mil- 
lions of peaceful herdsmen and la- 
borers who worked as long as they 
could, and fled before the advance 
of the armies that were led by the 
few, then waited until the danger 
was past, and returned to repair 
damages with patient hands. So the 
people are patient and honest, while 
their rulers stumble. I rejoice to see 
in the world and in this country a 
new and better patriotism than that 
which seeks the life of an enemy. It 
is a patriotism higher than that of 
the battle-field. It moves thousands 
to lay down their lives in social ser- 
vice, and every life so laid down 
48 



brings us a step nearer the time 
when corn-fields shall no more be 
fields of battle. So when I heard of 
the cruel fighting in the Philippines, 
I did not despair, because I knew 
that the hearts of our people were 
not in that fight, and that sometime 
the hand of the destroyer must be 
stayed.

a HE test of all beliefs is their 
practical effect in life. If it be 
true that optimism compels 
the world forward, and pessimism 
retards it, then it is dangerous to 
propagate a pessimistic philosophy. 
One who believes that the pain in 
the world outweighs the joy, and 
expresses that unhappy conviction, 
only adds to the pain. Schopenhauer 
is an enemy to the race. Even if he 
earnestly believed that this is the 
most wretched of possible worlds, 
he should not promulgate a doctrine 

53

which robs men of the incentive to 
fight with circumstance. If Life gave 
him ashes for bread, it was his fault. 
Life is a fair field, and the right will 
prosper if we stand by our guns. 

Let pessimism once take hold of 
the mind, and life is all topsy-turvy, all 
vanity and vexation of spirit. There 
is no cure for individual or social dis- 
order, except in forgetfulness and 
annihilation. "Let us eat, drink and 
be merry," says the pessimist, "for 
to-morrow we die." If I regarded my 
life from the point of view of the pes- 
simist, I should be undone. I should 
seek in vain for the light that does 
not visit my eyes and the music that 
does not ring in my ears. I should beg 
night and day and never be satisfied. 
I should sit apart in awful solitude, a 
prey to fear and despair. But since I 
consider it a duty to myself and to 
others to be happy, I escape a misery 
worse than any physical deprivation. 
54 



Who shall dare let his incapacity 
for hope or goodness cast a shadow 
upon the courage of those who bear 
their burdens as if they were privi- 
leges ?The optimist cannot fall back, 
cannot falter ; for he knows his neigh- 
bor will be hindered by his failure to 
keep in line. He will therefore hold 
his place fearlessly and remember 
the duty of silence. Sufficient unto 
each heart is its own sorrow. He 
will take the iron claws of circum- 
stance in his hand and use them as 
tools to break away the obstacles 
that block his path. He will work as 
if upon him alone depended the es- 
tablishment of heaven on earth. 

We have seen that the world's phi- 
losophers -the Sayers of the Word 
were optimists; so also are the 
men of action and achievement the 
Doers of the Word. Dr. Howe found 
his way to Laura Bridgman's soul 
because he began with the belief 

55 



l)e practice 



that he could reach it. English jurists 
had said that the deaf-blind were 
idiots in the eyes of the law. Behold 
what the optimist does. He contro- 
verts a hard legal axiom ; he looks 
behind the dull impassive clay and 
sees a human soul in bondage, and 
quietly, resolutely sets about its de- 
liverance. His efforts are victorious. 
He creates intelligence out of idiocy 
and proves to the law that the deaf- 
blind man is a responsible being. 

When Haiiy offered to teach the 
blind to read, he was met by pessi- 
mism that laughed at his folly. Had 
he not believed that the soul of man 
is mightier than the ignorance that 
fetters it, had he not been an opti- 
mist, he would not have turned the 
fingers of the blind into new instru- 
ments. No pessimist ever discovered 
the secrets of the stars, or sailed to 
an uncharted land, or opened a new 
heaven to the human spirit. St. Ber- 
56

nard was so deeply an optimist that 
he believed two hundred and fifty en- 
lightened men could illuminate the 
darkness which overwhelmed the 
period of the Crusades ; and the light 
of his faith broke like a new day up- 
on western Europe. John Bosco, the 
benefactor of the poor and the friend- 
less of Italian cities, was another 
optimist, another prophet who, per- 
ceiving a Divine Idea while it was 
yet afar, proclaimed it to his coun- 
trymen. Although they laughed at 
his vision and called him a madman, 
yet he worked on patiently, and with 
the labor of his hands he maintained 
a home for little street waifs. In the 
fervor of enthusiasm he predicted the 
wonderful movement which should 
result from his work. Even in the 
days before he had money or patron- 
age, he drew glowing pictures of the 
splendid system of schools and hos- 
pitals which should spread from one 

57 



practice of >ptimf$m 

end of Italy to the other, and he lived 
to see the organization of the San 
Salvador Society, which was the 
embodiment of his prophetic opti- 
mism. When Dr. Seguin declared his 
opinion that the feeble-minded could 
be taught, again people laughed, 
and in their complacent wisdom said 
he was no better than an idiot him- 
self. But the noble optimist perse- 
vered, and by and by the reluctant 
pessimists saw that he whom they 
ridiculed had become one of the 
world's philanthropists.Thus the op- 
timist believes, attempts, achieves. 
He stands always in the sunlight. 
Some day the wonderful, the inex- 
pressible, arrives and shines upon 
him, and he is there to welcome it. 
His soul meets his own and beats a 
glad march to every new discovery, 
every fresh victory over difficulties, 
every addition to human knowledge 
and happiness.

We have found that our great phi- 
losophers and our great men of ac- 
tion are optimists. So, too, our most 
potent men of letters have been op- 
timists in their books and in their 
lives. No pessimist ever won an au- 
dience commensurately wide with 
his genius, and many optimistic writ- 
ers have been read and admired out 
of all measure to their talents, sim- 
ply because they wrote of the sun- 
lit side of life. Dickens, Lamb, Gold- 
smith, Irving, all the well-beloved 
and gentle humorists, were opti- 
mists. Swift, the pessimist, has never 
had as many readers as his tower- 
ing genius should command, and in^ 
deed, when he comes down into our 
century and meets Thackeray, that 
generous optimist can hardly do him 
justice. In spite of the latter-day no- 
toriety of the "Rubaiyat" of Omar 
Khayyam, we may set it down as a 
rule that he who would be heard 

59 



$tmtfce of >ptimf$m 



must be a believer, must have a fun- 
damental optimism in his philoso- 
phy. He may bluster and disagree 
and lament as Carlyle and Ruskin 
do sometimes; but a basic confi- 
dence in the good destiny of life and 
of the world must underlie his work. 

Shakespeare is the prince of opti- 
mists. His tragedies are a revelation 
of moral order. In " Lear " and " Ham- 
let" there is a looking forward to 
something better, some one is left at 
the end of the play to right wrong, 
restore society and build the state 
anew. The later plays, "The Tem- 
pesf'and "Cymbeline," show a beau- 
tiful, placid optimism which delights 
in reconciliations and reunions and 
which plans for the triumph of ex- 
ternal as well as internal good. 

If Browning were less difficult to 
read, he would surely be the domi- 
nant poet in this century. I feel the 
ecstasy with which he exclaims, 
60 



practice of 



"Oh, good gigantic smile o' the 
brown old earth this autumn morn- 
ing!" And how he sets my brain go- 
ing when he says, because there is 
imperfection, there must be perfec- 
tion ; completeness must come of in- 
completeness ; failure is an evidence 
of triumph for the fulness of the days. 
Yes, discord is, that harmony may 
be; pain destroys, that health may 
renew; perhaps I am deaf and blind 
that others likewise afflicted may 
see and hear with a more perfect 
sense ! From Browning I learn that 
there is no lost good, and that makes 
it easier for me to go at life, right or 
wrong, do the best I know, and fear 
not. My heart responds proudly to 
his exhortation to pay gladly life's 
debt of pain, darkness and cold. Lift 
up your burden, it is God's gift, bear 
it nobly. 

The man of letters whose voice is 
to prevail must be an optimist, and 

61 



C^e practice of 



his voice often learns its message 
from his life. Stevenson's life has be- 
come a tradition only ten years af- 
ter his death ; he has taken his place 
among the heroes, the bravest man 
of letters since Johnson and Lamb. 
I remember an hour when I was dis- 
couraged and ready to falter. For 
days I had been pegging away at a 
task which refused to get itself ac- 
complished. In the midst of my per- 
plexity I read an essay of Stevenson 
which made me feel as if I had been 
"outing" in the sunshine, instead of 
losing heart over a difficult task. I 
tried again with new courage and 
succeeded almost before I knew it 
I have failed many times since ; but I 
have never felt so disheartened as I 
did before that sturdy preacher gave 
me my lesson in the "fashion of the 
smiling face." 

Read Schopenhauer and Omar, 
and you will grow to find the world as 
62 



$ractfce 



hollow as they find it. Read Green's 
history of England, and the world is 
peopled with heroes. I never knew 
why Green's history thrilled me with 
the vigor of romance until I read his 
biography. Then I learned how his 
quick imagination transfigured the 
hard, bare facts of life into new and 
living dreams. When he and his wife 
were too poor to have a fire, he would 
sit before the unlit hearth and pre- 
tend that it was ablaze. "Drill your 
thoughts," he said; "shut out the 
gloomy and call in the bright. There 
is more wisdom in shutting one's 
eyes than your copybook philoso- 
phers will allow." 

Every optimist moves along with 
progress and hastens it, while every 
pessimist would keep the world at 
a standstill. The consequence of 
pessimism in the life of a nation is 
the same as in the life of the indi- 
vidual. Pessimism kills the instinct 

63 



practice 



that urges men to struggle against 
poverty, ignorance and crime, and 
dries up all the fountains of joy in 
the world. In imagination I leave 
the country which lifts up the man- 
hood of the poor and I visit India, 
the underworld of fatalism where 
three hundred million human beings, 
scarcely men, submerged in igno- 
rance and misery, precipitate them- 
selves still deeper into the pit. Why 
are they thus ? Because they have for 
thousands of years been the victims 
of their philosophy, which teaches 
them that men are as grass, and 
the grass fadeth, and there is no 
more greenness upon the earth.They 
sit in the shadow and let the cir- 
cumstances they should master grip 
them, until they cease to be Men, and 
are made to dance and salaam like 
puppets in a play. After a little hour 
death comes and hurries them off to 
the grave, and other puppets with 
64 



other "pasteboard passions and de- 
sires" take their place, and the show 
goes on for centuries. 

Go to India and see what sort 
of civilization is developed when a 
nation lacks faith in progress and 
bows to the gods of darkness. Under 
the influence of Brahminism genius 
and ambition have been suppressed. 
There is no one to befriend the poor 
or to protect the fatherless and the 
widow. The sick lie untended. The 
blind know not how to see, nor the 
deaf to hear, and they are left by the 
roadside to die. In India it is a sin to 
teach the blind and the deaf because 
their affliction is regarded as a pun- 
ishment for offences in a previous 
state of existence. If I had been born 
in the midst of these fatalistic doc- 
trines, I should still be in darkness, 
my life a desert-land where no cara- 
van of thought might pass between 
my spirit and the world beyond.

The Hindoos believe in endurance, 
but not in resistance ; therefore they 
have been subdued by strangers. 
Their history is a repetition of that 
of Babylon. A nation from afar came 
with speed swiftly, and none stum- 
bled, or slept, or slumbered, but they 
brought desolation upon the land, 
and took the stay and the staff from 
the people, the whole stay of bread, 
and the whole stay of water, the 
mighty man, and the man of war, 
the judge, and the prophet, and the 
prudent, and the ancient, and none 
delivered them. Woe, indeed, is the 
heritage of those who walk sad- 
thoughted and downcast through 
this radiant, soul-delighting earth, 
blind to its beauty and deaf to its 
music, and of those who call evil 
good, and good evil, and put dark- 
ness for light, and light for darkness.

from the plains of Dakota, for the 
Omars and the Brahmins? They 
would say to the Hindoos, "Blot out 
your philosophy, dead for a thousand

ity and Life, put away your Brah- 
mins and your crooked gods, and

Optimism is the faith that leads to 
achievement ; nothing can be done 
without hope. When our forefathers 
laid the foundation of the American 
commonwealths, what nerved them 
to their task but a vision of a free 
community ? Against the cold, inhos- 
pitable sky, across the wilderness 
white with snow, where lurked the 
hidden savage, gleamed the bow of 
promise, toward which they set their 
faces with the faith that levels moun- 
tains, fills up valleys, bridges rivers 
and carries civilization to the utter- 
most parts of the earth. Although 

67 



practice of Dpt(mf$m 

the pioneers could not build accord- 
ing to the Hebraic ideal they saw, 
yet they gave the pattern of all that 
is most enduring in our country to- 
day. They brought to the wilderness 
the thinking mind, the printed book, 
the deep-rooted desire for self-gov- 
ernment and the English common 
law that judges alike the king and 
the subject, the law on which rests 
the whole structure of our society. 
It is significant that the foun- 
dation of that law is optimistic. In 
Latin countries the court proceeds 
with a pessimistic bias.The prisoner 
is held guilty until he is proved in- 
nocent. In England and the United 
States there is an optimistic pre- 
sumption that the accused is inno- 
cent until it is no longer possible to 
deny his guilt. Under our system, it 
is said, many criminals are acquitted ; 
but it is surely better so than that 
many innocent persons should suf- 
68 



practice of >ptfmf m 

fer.The pessimist cries, "There is no 
enduring good in man ! The tendency 
of all things is through perpetual loss 
to chaos in the end. If there was ever 
an idea of good in things evil, it was 
impotent, and the world rushes on 
to ruin." But behold, the law of the 
two most sober-minded, practical 
and law-abiding nations on earth 
assumes the good in man and de- 
mands a proof of the bad. 

Optimism is the faith that leads 
to achievement. The prophets of the 
world have been of good heart, or 
their standards would have stood 
naked in the field without a defender. 
Tolstoi's strictures lose power be- 
cause they are pessimistic. If he had 
seen clearly the faults of America, 
and still believed in her capacity to 
overcome them, our people might 
have felt the stimulation of his cen- 
sure. But the world turns its back 
on a hopeless prophet and listens to 

69 



Clje $tmtfce of >ptfm$m 

Emerson who takes into account 
the best qualities of the nation and 
attacks only the vices which no one 
can defend or deny. It listens to the 
strong man, Lincoln, who in times 
of doubt, trouble and need does not 
falter. He sees success afar, and by 
strenuous hope, by hoping against 
hope, inspires a nation. Through the 
night of despair he says, "All is well," 
and thousands rest in his confidence. 
When such a man censures, and 
points to a fault, the nation obeys, 
and his words sink into the ears of 
men ; but to the lamentations of the 
habitual Jeremiah the ear grows dull. 
Our newspapers should remember 
this. The press is the pulpit of the 
modern world, and on the preachers 
who fill it much depends. If the pro- 
test of the press against unrighteous 
measures is to avail, then for ninety- 
nine days the word of the preacher 
should be buoyant and of good cheer, 
70 



$ractfce 



so that on the hundredth day the 
voice of censure may be a hundred 
times strong. This was Lincoln's 
way. He knew the people; he be- 
lieved in them and rested his faith on 
the justice and wisdom of the great 
majority. When in his rough and 
ready way he said, "You can't fool 
all the people all the time," he ex- 
pressed a great principle, the doc- 
trine of faith in human nature. 

The prophet is not without honor, 
save he be a pessimist. The ecstatic 
prophecies of Isaiah did far more to 
restore the exiles of Israel to their 
homes than the lamentations of Jer- 
emiah did to deliver them from the 
hands of evil-doers. 

Even on Christmas Day do men 
remember that Christ came as a pro- 
phet of good? His joyous optimism 
is like water to feverish lips, and has 
for its highest expression the eight 
beatitudes. It is because Christ is 



Clje $ractfce 

an optimist that for ages he has 
dominated the Western world. For 
nineteen centuries Christendom has 
gazed into his shining face and felt 
that all things work together for 
good. St. Paul, too, taught the faith 
which looks beyond the hardest 
things into the infinite horizon of 
heaven, where all limitations are lost 
in the light of perfect understand- 
ing. If you are born blind, search the 
treasures of darkness.They are more 
precious than the gold of Ophir. They 
are love and goodness and truth and 
hope, and their price is above rubies 
and sapphires. 

Jesus utters and Paul proclaims a 
message of peace and a message of 
reason, a belief in the Idea, not in 
things, in love, not in conquest. The 
optimist is he who sees that men's 
actions are directed not by squad- 
rons and armies, but by moral power, 
that the conquests of Alexander and 
72 



I)e practice of >ptfmf$m 



Napoleon are less abidingthan New- 
ton's and Galileo's and St. Augus- 
tine's silent mastery of the world. 
Ideas are mightier than fire and 
sword. Noiselessly they propagate 
themselves from land to land, and 
mankind goes out and reaps the 
rich harvest and thanks God; but 
the achievements of the warrior are 
like his canvas city, "to-day a camp, 
to-morrow all struck and vanished, 
a few pit-holes and heaps of straw." 
This was the gospel of Jesus two 
thousand years ago. Christmas Day 
is the festival of optimism. 

Although there are still great evils 
which have not been subdued, and 
the optimist is not blind to them, yet 
he is full of hope. Despondency has 
no place in his creed, for he believes 
in the imperishable righteousness of 
God and the dignity of man. History 
records man's triumphant ascent. 
Each halt in his progress has been 

73 



practice 



but a pause before a mighty leap for- 
ward. The time is not out of joint. If 
indeed some of the temples we wor- 
shipped in have fallen, we have built 
new ones on the sacred sites loftier 
and holier than those which have 
crumbled. If we have lost some of 
the heroic physical qualities of our 
ancestors, we have replaced them 
with a spiritual nobleness that turns 
aside wrath and binds up the wounds 
of the vanquished. All the past at- 
tainments of man are ours ; and more, 
his day-dreams have become our 
clear realities. Therein lies our hope 
and sure faith. 

As I stand in the sunshine of a sin- 
cere and earnest optimism, my ima- 
gination " paints yet more glorious 
triumphs on the cloud-curtain of the 
future." Out of the fierce struggle 
and turmoil of contending systems 
and powers I see a brighter spiritual 
era slowly emerge an era in which 
74 



practice of Dptfmi$m 

there shall be no England, no France, 
no Germany, no America, no this 
people or that, but one family, the 
human race; one law, peace; one 
need, harmony; one means, labor; 
one taskmaster, God. 

If I should try to say anew the 
creed of the optimist, I should say 
something like this: "I believe in 
God, I believe in man, I believe in the 
power of the spirit. I believe it is a 
sacred duty to encourage ourselves 
and others ; to hold the tongue from 
any unhappy word against God's 
world, because no man has any right 
to complain of a universe which God 
made good, and which thousands of 
men have striven to keep good. I be- 
lieve we should so act that we may 
draw nearer and more near the age 
when no man shall live at his ease 
while another suffers." These are 
the articles of my faith, and there 
is yet another on which all depends 

75 



practice of Dptftttf$m 

to bear this faith above every tem- 
pest which o verfloods it, and to make 
it a principle in disaster and through 
affliction. Optimism is the harmony 
between man's spirit and the spirit of 
God pronouncing His works good.
