THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN 
AND HELL 

THE ARGUMENT 

RINTRAH roars and shakes his 
fires in the burdenM air, 
Hungry clouds swag on the deep. 

Once meek, and in a perilous path 

The just man kept his course along 

The Vale of Death. 

Roses are planted where thorns grow, 

And on the barren heath 

Sing the honey bees. 

Then the perilous path was planted, 
And a river and a spring 
On every cliff and tomb; 

5 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

And on the bleached bones 
Red clay brought forth: 
Till the villain left the paths of ease 
To walk in perilous paths, and drive 
The just man into barren climes. 

Now the sneaking serpent walks 
In mild humility ; 

And the just man rages in the wilds 
Where Uons roam. 

Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in 

the burdened air, 
Hungry clouds swag on the deep. 

As a new heaven is begun, and it is 
now thirty-three years since its advent, 
the Eternal Hell revives. And lo! 
Swedenborg is the angel sitting at 
the tomb: his writings are the Unen 
clothes folded up. Now is the domin- 
ion of Edom, and the return of Adam 
into Paradise. — See Isaiah xxxiv. and 
XXXV. chap.

HEAVEN AND HELL 

Without contraries is no progres- 
sion. Attraction and repulsion, rea- 
son and energy, love and hate, are 
necessary to human existence. 

From these contraries spring what 
the religious call Good and Evil. 
Good is the passive that obeys reason; 
Evil is the active springing from 
Energy. 

Good is heaven. Evil is hell. 



THE MARRIAGE OF 



THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL 

All Bibles or sacred codes have been 
the cause of the following errors : — 

1. That man has two real existing 
principles, viz., a Body and a Soul. 

2. That Energy, called Evil, is alone 
from the Body ; and that Reason, called 
Good, is alone from the Soul. 

3. That God will torment man in 
Eternity for following his Energies. 

But the following contraries to 
these are true : — 

1 . Man has no Body distinct from his 
Soul. For that called Body is a por- 
tion of Soul discerned by the five senses, 
the chief inlets of Soul in this age. 

2 . Energy is the only life , and is from 
the Body; and Reason is the bound 
or outward circumference of Energy. 

8 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

3. Energy is Eternal Delight. 

Those who restrain desire, do so 
because theirs is weak enough to be 
restrained; and the restrainer or 
reason usurps its place and governs 
the unwilling. 

And being restrained, it by degrees 
becomes passive, till it is only the 
shadow of desire. 

The history of this is written in 
Paradise Lost, and the Governor or 
Reason is called Messiah. 

And the original Archangel or pos- 
sessor of the command of the heavenly 
host is called the Devil, or Satan, and 
his children are called Sin and Death. 

But in the book of Job, Milton's 
Messiah is called Satan. 

For this history has been adopted by 
both parties. 

It indeed appeared to Reason as if 

9 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

desire was cast out, but the Devil's 
account is, that the Messiah fell, and 
formed a heaven of what he stole from 
the abyss. 

This is shown in the Gospel, where 
he prays to the Father to send the 
Comforter or desire that Reason may 
have ideas to build on, the Jehovah 
of the Bible being no other than he 
who dwells in flaming fire. Know 
that after Christ's death he became 
Jehovah. 

But in Milton, the Father is Destiny, 
the Son a ratio of the five senses, and 
the Holy Ghost vacuum ! 

Note. — The reason Milton wrote 
in fetters when he wrote of Angels 
and God, and at Uberty when of 
Devils and Hell, is because he was 
a true poet, and of the Devil's party 
without knowing it.

HEAVEN AND HELL 



A MEMORABLE FANCY 

As I was walking among the fires 
of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments 
of Genius, which to Angels look like 
torment and insanity, I collected some 
of their proverbs, thinking that as the 
sayings used in a nation mark its 
character, so the proverbs of Hell show 
the nature of infernal wisdom better 
than any description of buildings or 
garments. 

When I came home, on the abyss 
of the five senses, where a flat-sided 
steep frowns over the present world, I 
saw a mighty Devil folded in black 
clouds hovering on the sides of the 
rock; with corroding fires he wrote 
the following sentence now perceived 
by the minds of men, and read by 
them on earth : — 

II 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

"How do you know but every bird 
that cuts the airy way 
Is an immense world of delight, 
closed by your senses five?" 



12 



HEAVEN AND HELL 



PROVERBS OF HELL 

In seed-time learn, in harvest teach, 
in winter enjoy. 

Drive your cart and your plough 
over the bones of the dead. 

The road of excess leads to the 
palace of wisdom. 

Prudence is a rich ugly old maid 
courted by Incapacity. 

He who desires, but acts not, breeds 
pestilence. 

The cut worm forgives the plough. 

Dip him in the river who loves 
water. 

A fool sees not the same tree that a 
wise man sees. 

He whose face gives no light shall 
never become a star. 

13 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

Eternity is in love with the produc- 
tions of time. 

The busy bee has no time for sor- 
row. 

The hours of folly are measured by 
the clock, but of wisdom no clock can 
measure. 

All wholesome food is caught with- 
out a net or a trap. 

Bring out number, weight, and 
measure in a year of dearth. 

No bird soars too high if he soars 
with his own wings. 

A dead body revenges not injuries. 

The most sublime act is to set an- 
other before you. 

If the fool would persist in his folly 
he would become wise. 

Folly is the cloak of knavery. 

Shame is Pride's cloak. 

14 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

Prisons are built with stones of law, 
brothels with bricks of religion. 

The pride of the peacock is the 
glory of God. 

The lust of the goat is the bounty 
of God. 

The wrath of the lion is the wisdom 
of God. 

The nakedness of woman is the 
work of God. 

Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of 
joy weeps. 

The roaring of lions, the howling of 
wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, 
and the destructive sword, are por- 
tions of Eternity too great for the eye 
of man. 

The fox condemns the trap, not 
himself. 

Joys impregnate, sorrows bring 
forth. 

15 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

Let man wear the fell of the lion, 
woman the fleece of the sheep. 

The bird a nest, the spider a web, 
man friendship. 

The selfish smiling fool and the 
sullen frowning fool shall be both 
thought wise that they may be a rod. 

What is now proved was once only 
imagined. 

The rat, the mouse, the fox, the 
rabbit watch the roots; the Hon, the 
tiger, the horse, the elephant watch 
the fruits. 

The cistern contains, the fountain 
overflows. 

One thought fills immensity. 

Always be ready to speak your 
mind, and a base man will avoid you. 

Everything possible to be believed 
is an image of truth. 

The eagle never lost so much time 

z6 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

as when he submitted to learn of the 
crow. 

The fox provides for himself, but 
God provides for the lion. 

Think in the morning, act in the 
noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the 
night. 

He who has suffered you to impose 
on him knows you. 

As the plough follows words, so 
God rewards prayers. 

The tigers of wrath are wiser than 
the horses of instruction. 

Expect poison from the standing 
water. 

You never know what is enough 
unless you know what is more than 
enough. 

Listen to the fool's reproach; it is a 
kingly title. 

The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, 

17 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

the mouth of water, the beard of 
earth. 

The weak in courage is strong in 
cunning. 

The apple tree never asks the beech 
how he shall grow, nor the lion the 
horse how he shall take his prey. 

The thankful receiver bears a plenti- 
ful harvest. 

If others had not been foolish we 
should have been so. 

The soul of sweet delight can never 
be defiled. 

When thou seest an eagle, thou 
seest a portion of Genius. Lift up thy 
head! 

As the caterpillar chooses the fairest 
leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest 
lays his curse on the fairest joys. 

To create a little flower is the labour 
of ages. 

i8 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

Damn braces; bless relaxes. 

The best wine is the oldest, the best 
water the newest. 

Prayers plough not; praises reap 
not; joys laugh not; sorrows weep 
not. 

The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, 
the genitals Beauty, the hands and 
feet Proportion. 

As the air to a bird, or the sea 
to a fish, so is contempt to the con- 
temptible. 

The crow wished everything was 
black; the owl that everything was 
white. 

Exuberance is Beauty. 

If the lion was advised by the fox, 
he would be cunning. 

Improvement makes straight roads, 
but the crooked roads without Improve- 
ment are roads of Genius. 

19 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

Sooner murder an infant in its 
cradle than nurse unacted desires. 

Where man is not, nature is barren. 

Truth can never be told so as to be 
understood and not to be believed. 

Enough! or Too much. 

The ancient poets animated all sen- 
sible objects with Gods or Geniuses, 
calling them by the names and adorn- 
ing them with properties of woods, 
rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, na- 
tions, and whatever their enlarged 
and numerous senses could perceive. 
And particularly they studied the 
Genius of each city and country, 
placing it under its mental deity. Till 
a system was formed, which some 
took advantage of and enslaved the 
vulgar by attempting to realize or 
abstract the mental deities from their 
objects. Thus began Priesthood. 

20 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

Choosing forms of worship from 
poetic tales. And at length they pro- 
nounced that the Gods had ordered 
such things. Thus men forgot that 
all deities reside in the human breast. 



21 



THE MARRIAGE OF 



A MEMORABLE FANCY 

The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel 
dined with me, and I asked them how 
they dared so roundly to assert that 
God spoke to them, and whether they 
did not think at the time that they 
would be misunderstood, and so be 
the cause of imposition. 

Isaiah answered: "I saw no God, 
nor heard any, in a finite organical 
perception: but my senses discovered 
the infinite in everything; and as I 
was then persuaded, and remained 
confirmed, that the voice of honest 
indignation is the voice of God, I cared 
not for consequences, but wrote.'* 

Then I asked: "Does a firm per- 
suasion that a thing is so, make it 
so?" 

He replied: "All poets believe that 

22 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

it does, and in ages of imagination 
this firm persuasion removed moun- 
tains; but many are not capable of a 
firm persuasion of anything." 

Then Ezekiel said : " The philosophy 
of the East taught the first principles 
of human perception; some nations 
held one principle for the origin, and 
some another. We of Israel taught 
that the Poetic Genius (as you now 
call it) was the first principle, and all 
the others merely derivative, which 
was the cause of our despising the 
Priests and Philosophers of other 
countries, and prophesying that all 
Gods would at last be proved to origi- 
nate in ours, and to be the tributaries 
of the Poetic Genius. It was this that 
our great poet King David desired so 
fervently, and invokes so pathetically, 
saying by this he conquers enemies 
and governs kingdoms; and we so 
loved our Ggd that we cursed in His 

i3 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

name all the deities of surrounding 
nations, and asserted that they had 
rebelled. From these opinions the 
vulgar came to think that all nations 
would at last be subject to the Jews. 

"This," said he, "like all firm per- 
suasions, is come to pass, for all 
nations believe the Jews' code, and 
worship the Jews' God; and what 
greater subjection can be?" 

I heard this with some wonder, and 
must confess my own conviction. 
After dinner I asked Isaiah to favour 
the world with his lost works; he said 
none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel 
said the same of his. 

I also asked Isaiah what made him 
go naked and barefoot three years. 
He answered: "The same that made 
our friend Diogenes the Grecian." 

I then asked Ezekiel why he ate 
dung, and lay so long on his right and 

24 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

left side. He answered: "The desire 
of raising other men into a perception 
of the infinite. This the North Ameri- 
can tribes practise. And is he honest 
who resists his genius or conscience, 
only for the sake of present ease or 
gratification?" 

The ancient tradition that the world 
will be consumed in fire at the end of 
six thousand years is true, as I have 
heard from Hell. 

For the cherub with his flaming 
sword is hereby commanded to leave 
his guard at [the] tree of life, and 
when he does, the whole creation will 
be consumed and appear infinite and 
holy, whereas it now appears finite 
and corrupt. 

This will come to pass by an im- 
provement of sensual enjoyment. 

But first the notion that man has 

25 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

a body distinct from his soul is to be 
expunged; this I shall do by printing 
in the infernal method by corrosives, 
which in Hell are salutary and medici- 
nal, melting apparent surfaces away, 
and displaying the infinite which was 
hid. 

If the doors of perception were 
cleansed everything would appear to 
man as it is, infinite. 

For man has closed himself up, till 
he sees all things through narrow 
chinks of his cavern. 



26 



HEAVEN AND HELL 



A MEMORABLE FANCY 

I was in a printing-house in Hell, 
and saw the method in which knowl- 
edge is transmitted from generation 
to generation. 

In the first chamber was a dragon- 
man, clearing away the rubbish from 
a cave's mouth; within, a number of 
dragons were hollowing the cave. 

In the second chamber was a viper 
folding round the rock and the cave, 
and others adorning it with gold, silver, 
and precious stones. 

In the third chamber was an eagle 
with wings and feathers of air; he 
caused the inside of the cave to be 
infinite; around were numbers of 
eagle-like men, who built palaces in 
the immense cliffs. 

In the fourth chamber were lions 

27 



THE MARRIAGE OF 

of flaming fire raging around and 
melting the metals into living fluids. 

In the fifth chamber were unnamed 
forms, which cast the metals into the 
expanse. 

There they were received by men 
who occupied the sixth chamber, and 
took the forms of books, and were 
arranged in libraries. 

The Giants who formed this world 
into its sensual existence and now 
seem to live in it in chains are in 
truth the causes of its life and the 
sources of all activity, but the chains 
are the cunning of weak and tame 
minds, which have power to resist 
energy, according to the proverb, 
"The weak in courage is strong in 
cunning." 

Thus one portion of being is the 

28 



HEAVEN AND HELL 

Prolific, the other the Devouring. To 
the devourer it seems as if the pro- 
ducer was in his chains; but it is not 
so, he only takes portions of existence, 
and fancies that the whole. 

But the Prolific would cease to be 
prolific unless the Devourer as a sea 
received the excess of his delights. 

Some will say, "Is not God alone 
the Prolific?" I answer: "God only 
acts and is in existing beings or 
men." 

These two classes of men are always 
upon earth, and they should be ene- 
mies: whoever tries to reconcile them 
seeks to destroy existence. 

Religion is an endeavour to recon- 
cile the two. 

Note. — Jesus Christ did not wish 
to unite but to separate t
