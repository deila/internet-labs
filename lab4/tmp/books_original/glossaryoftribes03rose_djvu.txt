PREFACE TO VOLUME 11. 

This niossary of tlie Tribes and Castes found in the Pimjal), 
the North-West Frontier Province and tlie l^^^tected Territories 
on the North- West Frontier of India, is based upon the works of 
the late Sir Denzil Charles Jelf Ibbetson, K.C.S.I., Lieutenant- 
Governor of the Punjab and its Dependencies, and of the 
Hon'ble Mr. Edward Douglas Maclagan, C.S.T., now Secretary 
to the Grovernment of India in the Revenue Department. Sir 
Denzil Ibbetson's Report on the Punjal) Census of 1881 was 
reprinted as Pun jab Ethnography. Vohime HI of the present com- 
pilation will include the rest of this (rlosaari/, and Volume I will 
comprise the valuable chapters of Sir Denzil Ibbetson's Report 
which deal with the Physical Description of tlie Punjal), its Reli- 
gions and other subjects, supplemented by the matter contained 
in the Hon'ble Mr. Maclagan's Report on the Punjab Census of 
1891, and from other sources. 

This Glossary embodies some of the materials collected in 
the Ethnographic Survey of India which was begun in 1900, 
under the scheme initiated by Sir Herbert Risley, K.C.I.B., 
C.S.I. , but it has no pretensions to finality. The compiler's aim 
has been to collect facts and record them in the fullest possible 
detail without formulating theories as to the racial elements which 
have made the population of the modern Punjab, the growth of 
its tribes or the evolution of caste. For information regard- 
ing the various theories which have been suggested on those 
topics the reader may be referred to the works of Sir Alexande^ 
Cunningham,* Bellewf and Nesfield.J 

The Census Report for India, 190^, Sind The Races of India 
may also be referred to as standard works on these subjects. 

It is in contemplation to add to Volume III, or to publish as 
Volume IV, a subject-index to the whole of the present work^

together witli nppendices containing exhaustive lists of tlie 
numerous sections, septs and clans into which the tribes and 
castes of these Provinces are divided. 

A few words are necessary to explain certain points in the 
Glossary. To ensure brevity' the compiler has avoided constant 
repetition of the word " District " e. g., by " Lahore " the District 
of that name must be understood thus " in Lahore " is equivalent 
to the " in the District of Lahore," but by " at Lahore " is 
meant " in the city of Lahore." 

The printing of the name of a caste or tribe in capitals in 
the text indicates that a reference to the article on that caste 
or tribe is invited for fuller information. References to District 
or State Goi^:ettenrs should be taken to indicate the latest editio n 
of the Gazettepv unless the contrary is stated. References to a 
Settlenipvt liepoH indicate the standard Report on the Regular 
Settlement of the District in the absence of any express re- 
ference to an earlier or later report. 

Certain recognised abbreviations have also been used, e.g., 

J.R.A.S., for the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. 

J.A.S.B., for the Journal of the (Royal) Asiatic Society 
of Bengal. 

P.N.Q., for Punjab Notes and Queries, 1883-85. 

I.N'.Q., for Indian Notes and Queries, 1886. 

ISf.I.N.Q., for North Indian Notes and Queries, 1891-9G. 

E.H.I., for Elliot's History of India. 

T.N., for Raverty's Translation of the Tahaqat-i-Nasiri. 

In certain districts of the Punjab lists of agricultural tribes 
have been compiled by District Officers for administrative pur- 
poses in connection with the working of the Punjab Alienation 
of Land Act (Punjab Act XIII of 1900), and these lists have been 
incorporated in the present Glossary for facility of reference. 

The two following extracts from an Address delivered by the 
late Sir Denzil Ibbetson on J;he Study of Anthropology in India to 



Ill 



the Antliropological Society of Bombay in 1 890 are re-printed 
here as of permanent interest and value : — 

" Another scheme which suggested itself to me some years ago, and 
met with the approval of Sir Charles Elliot, would, I think, greatly simplify 
and lighten the labour of recording customs, but which I unfortunately 
never found leisure to carry out. It was to publish typical custom-sheets 
printed with a wide margin.'^ The ])rintod portion would give a typical 
set of, say, marriage ceremonies, divided into short paragraphs, one for 
each stage. The inquirer would note opposite each paragraph the depar- 
tures from the typical ceremonial which he found to obtain among the 
people and in the locality under inquiry. The main lines of these and 
similar ceremonies are common to many tribes over a considerable area, 
and the system, which is of course capable of indefinite expansion, would 
save a deal of writing, would suggest inquiry, would be a safeguard against 
omissions, and above all, would bring differences of custom into prominence. 

•3f * * * «■ * 

" And now I have come to the fourth and last head of my discourse, 
and you will, I am sure, be relieved to know that I shall be brief. What 
is the use of it all ? I must premise that no true student ever asks himself 
such a question. To some of you, I fear, I shall appear profane, but I take 
it that the spirit which animates the true scholar is the same in essence as 
that which possesses the coin-collector or the postage stamp maniac. He 
yearns for more knowledge, not because he proposes to put it to any 
definite use when he has possessed himself of it, but because he has not 
got it, and hates to be without it. Nevertheless, it is a question which, if 
we do not ask ourselves, others -will ask for us, and it behoves us to have 
our answer ready. In the first place, it is impossible to assert of any 
addition, however apparently insignificant, to the sum of human knowledge, 
that it will not turn out to be of primary importance. The whole fabric 
of the universe is so closely interwoven, mesh by mesh, that at whatever 
out-of-the-way corner we may begin unravelling, we may presently assist 
in the loosening of some knot which has barred the progress of science. 
What Philistine would look with other than contempt upon the study of 
the shapes of fancy pigeons, of the markings of caterpillars and butterflies, 
and of the respective colourings of cock and hen birds. Yet from these 
three sources have been drawn the most vivid illustrations and the strong- 
est proofs of a theory the epoch-making nature of which we are hardly 
able to appreciate, because it has already become an integral part of the 
intellectual equipment of every thinking man. But Ave need not trust to 
the vagueness of the future for evidence of the value of our studies in 
India. They have already cast a flood of light upon the origin and nature 
of European tenures, and they have even modified the course of British 
legislation. I do not think it is too much to say that, had we known 
nothing of land tenures in India, the recognition of tenant right in Ulster 
would have been indefinitely postponed." 

The scientific spirit which inspired the above remarks laid 
the foundations of all anthropological research in the Punjab and 



* This method was adopted in carrying ml the Ethnographic Survey in these Provinces.

Nortli-West Frontier Province. The practical importance of an 
intensive study of tlie minutest data in the popular religion, 
folk-lore, traditions, survivals and superstitions cannot be easily 
exaggerated, and the present writer is convinced that nothing but 
a closer study of them will, for example, reconcile the apparently 
hopeless inconsistencies of the Punjab customary law.

Punjab Tribes and Castes. 



A 

AbazaIj a section of tho Yusufzai Pathans, found in Buner. 

Abba Khel, one of the six septs of the Baizai clan of tho Akozai Yusufzai 
Pa^hd,Q8, found in Peshdwar. 

Abbassi, the name of the ruling family of the Daudpotrds who are 
Nawabs of Bahawalpur and claim descent from tho Abbasside dynasty 
of i^gypt : see Daudpotra and Kalhor^. 

Abual, a small caste of Muhamraadans found in Kdngra and the 
Jaswiin Dun of Hoshiarpur. The Abddls arc divided into 12 tolls 
or septs. The Abduls of Kangra do not associate with those of 
Sukhdr and Nurpur. The Abddls are beggars and wanderino- 
singers, performing especially at Rdjput funerals, at which they 
precede the body singing and playing dirges, len or hirldp. In 
the time of the Raj^s when any Rdjput was killed in battle and 
the news reached his home, they got his clothes and used to 
wear them while singing his dirge. Thus they sang dirges f»r 
Rdm Singh, wazir of Nurpur, and Sham Singh, Atd,riwdld,, who had 
fought against the British, and for Rajd, Rai Singh of Chamba. 
The Abdals now sing various songs and attend Rajput weddings. 
They are endogamous. Abddl means 'lieutenant* (see Platts' 
Hind, Dicty,, s. v.) and is the name of a class of wandering 
Muhammadan saints.* Whether there is any connection between 
the name and the Chihil Abddl of Islamic mythology does not 
appear. For the Abdals in Bengal see Risley, People of India, 
pp. 76 and 119. 

Abdal, an Arain clan (agricultural), found in Montgomery. 

Abdali, (1) a term once applied generally to all Afghans {q. v.), but 
now apparently obsolete : (2) the name of a famous family of tho 
Saddozai Pa^hdns which gave Afghanistan its first Afghan dynasty: 
Now known as Durrani, this family belonged to the Sarbani branch 
of the Afghans, and is believed by them to derive its name from Abddl 
or Avddl bin Tarin bin Sharkhabun h. Sarban 6. Qais, who received 
this name from Kwhdja Abd Ahmad, an abddl't or saint of the Chishtid 

* It is the plur. of hadal, ' substitute,' and the Abdal, 40 in number, take the fifth place 
in the Sufi hierarchical order of saints issuing from the great Qutb, Also called 'Rukabi,' 
* guardians,' they reside in Syria, bring rain and victory and avert calamity ; Eticyclopxdia 
o/ Isldm, s. V, p. 69. 

t See Abdal supra. 



2 Ahddli — Adam Ehel, 

order. Driven from their lands near Qandaliar by the Ghalzai, the 
Abdi'ili had long been settled near llerdt, but were restored by Niidir 
Shah to their old homo, and when Ahmad Shilh became king at 
Qandahiir his tribe served as a nucleus for the new empire. Influenced 
by a faqir named Sabar Shah he took the title of Durr-i-durrdn, 
' pearl of pearls.' The two principal Abdali clans are the Popalzai, 
(to which belonged the royal section, the Sadozai) and the Barakzai : 
M. LoDgworth Uames in Encycl. of Islam, p. 67. 

Abdalke, a Kharral clan (agricultural), found in Montgomery. 

Abduut [avadhuta)* a degree or class of the celibate Gosains who live by 
beorging. They are wanderers, as opposed to tho viatddri or dsanddri 
class. Sec Gosaia. 

Abhiea, the modern Ahfr {q. v.). 

Abhai'Anthi, one of the 12 orders or schools of the Jogis (5. v.). 

Abkal, a sept of Rdjputs, descended from Wahgal, a son of Sangar Chand, 

16th K^ja of Kahlur. 
Adlana, (1) a Jat clan (agricultural), found in Multan : (2) a branch of the 

Kharrals, found in Montgomery and the Minchin^b^d nizdmat of 

Bahiiwalpur. 

Abioia, an ancient tribe of Jat status found in Sindh and the Bahdwalpur 
State. It is credited with having introduced the arts of agriculture 
into the south-west Punjab and Sindh in the proverb : — 

Kar7i hahhshe hiror. 
Abra bahhshe hal di or. 

' Let R^jfi Karn give away crore of rupees, the Abra will give what 
he earns by the plough.' 

The tribe is also said to be an offshoot of the Sammas and is 
numerous in Bahawalpur. 

Abui, a Jdt clan (agricultural), found in Multan, 

Abwani, a Pathdu clan (agricultural), found in Amritsar. 

Acha Khel, an important clan of the Marwat Pathans, found in 
Bannu. 

AcHi-LAMO (Tibetan), a group of actors, singers and dancers, found 
in Kanawar. They wear masks of skin with conch shells for 
eyes and a dress to which woollen cords are so attached that in 
dancing they spread out. Tho women play a large tambourine, and 
the men a small drum shaped like an hour-glass. Parties of five, 
— two men, two women and a boy — perform their dance. 

Achran, an agricultural clan, found in Shdhpur. 

Achakj(a), see under Brahman : syn. Mahabrahman. 

Adam Khel, one of the eight principal clans of the Afridi Pathans: 
said to be neither Gar nor Samil in politics. They have four 
septs— Hassan Khel, Jaw^ki, Galli and Ashu Khel. 

» Avadhuta is also the name of a Vaishnava sect. Ramanand founded the Ramawat sect 
whom he called Avadhuta, because his followers had ' shaken off ' the bounds of narrow- 
mindcdncss. To this sect belonged Tulsi Das, one of whose works was the Vairagya-Sandi- 
pani or ' kindling of continence.' {NoUs on Tuhi Dds, by Dr. G. A. Grierson. Indian 
Antiquary, 1893, p. 227),

Adan Shdhi-^Ahangar. 3 

Adan SHAHf, a Sikh sect or, moro correctly, order, founded by Adau 
Shdh, a disciple of Kanhyd. Ldl, the founder of the Sewapanthis 
iq.v.). 

Adh-nath, ono of the 12 orders or schools of the Jogis {q. v.), 
Admal, a sept of the Gakkhars {q. v.). 

A'dpanthj, possibly a title of those Sikhs who adhere to the original 
(ddi) faith (or to the ddi-granf;h) : cf. Census Report, 1891, § 88, 
but see Adh-ndth. 

Advait, a Hindu sect which maintains the unity of the soul with God 
after death. 

Afghan, pi. Afaghina: syn. Rohilla or Rohela and Pathdn {q. v-). The 
earliest historical mention of the Afghans occurs under the year 
1024 A. D. (414-15 Hijri) when Mahmud of Ghazni made a raid 
into the mountains inhabited by the Afghjinian— after his return 
from India to Ghazni — plundered them and carried off much booty.* 
Afghan tradition makes Kashighar or Shawdl their earliest scat, 
and the term Afghdnistan or land of the Afghans is said to be, 
strictly speaking, applicable to the mountainous country between 
Qandahdr and the Derajiit, end between Jalaldbad and the 
Khaibar valley on the north and SiwI and Dadar on the south, 
but it is now generally used to denote the kingdom of Afghanis- 
tan. The AfgMns used to be termed Abdalis or Awdalis from 
Malik Abdal under whom they first emerged from the Sulaimdn 
Range and drove the Kdfirs or infidels out of the Kdbul valley. 
(See also s. v. Pathan, Bangash, Dildzdk). By religion the 
Afghans are wholly Muhammadan and claim as their peculiar 
saint the ' Afghan Qntb,' Khwdjah Qutb-ud-din, Bakhtidr, Kaki 
of Ush (near Baghditd) who probably gave his name to the Qutb 
Mindr at Delhi. 

Agaei, Agri or Agaria "a worker in salt," from dgara, salt-pan. The Agaris 
are the salt-makers of Rdjputana and of the east and south-cast Punjab, 
and would appear to be a true caste. t In Gurgaon they are said to 
claim descent from the Rdjputs of Chittaur. All are Hindus, and 
found especially in the Sultdnpur tract on the common borders of Delhi, 
Rohtak and Gurgaon, where they make salt by evaporating the brackish 
water of the wells. Socially they rank below the Jdts, but above Lohdrs. 
A proverb says : " Theafe, thejawdsa, the Agari and the cartman — when 
the lightning flashes these give up the ghost," apparently because the rain 
which is likely to follow would dissolve their salt. Cf. Nungae. 

Aggarwal, a sub-caste of the Banias {q. v.). 
Agie, a doubtful synonym of Agari {q, v.). 
Agwana, a Jdt clan (agricultural), found in Multdn. 
Ahangar, a blacksmith. 

* For fuller details see the admirable articles by Mr. Longworth Dames on Afghanistan 
and Afridi in the Encyclopaedia of Islim (London: Luzac & Co.) now in courso of pub- 
lication. 

t But the Agarfs are also said to be a mere eiib-castc of the Kumhars. In Kumaon dgari 
means an " iron-smolter " : N. I. N. Q. I., §§ 214, 217. It is doubtful whether Agi-a derives 
its name from the Agaris, as there is an Agi-a in the Peshawar valley. For an account of Uio 
salt-industry in Gurgaon, see Qurgaon Qazettecr, 1884, page 57. 



4 Ahdri^^Ahir, 

A.HARf, a doubtful synonym of Aheri {q. v.). 

AHEEf (a), Ileri, Ahiiri (?), an out-caste and often vagrant tribe, found in the 
south-east Punjab, and originally immigrant* from Rdjputana, especi- 
ally Jodhpur and Bik^ner. The name is said to be derived from 
her, a herd of cattle, but the Ahori, who appears to be usually 
called Heri in the Punjab, is by heredity a hunter and fowler. He 
is however ordinarily a labourer, especially a reaper, and even culti- 
vates land in Hiss^r, while in Karnal he makes saltpetre.* In ap- 
pearance and physique Aheris resemble Baurias, but they have no 
dialect of their own, and are not, as a body, addicted to crime. 

Of their numerous gots the following are found in the B^wal 
nizdmat of Ndbha : — 



Bhata. 


Gahchand. 


Panwdl. 


Chdhurwdl. 


Ghaman. 


Rathor. 


Charan. 


Gogal. 


Sdgaria. 


Chanddlia. 


Got^l^. 


Sailingia. 


Dekhta. 


Hajipuria. 


Samelwdl 


Dahinwal. 


Jbindia. 


Sandlas. 


Dahmiwal, 


Junbal. 


Sdrsut. 


Dharoria. 


Mahta. 


Sendhi. 


Dhariiheria. 


Mewal. 





The Aheris are almost all Hindus, but in the Phulki^n States a few 
are Sikhs. Besides the other village deities they worship the goddess 
Masdnl and specially affect Bd,bd,ji of Kohmand in Jodhpur and 
Khetrp^l. In marriage four gots are avoided, and widow re-marriage 
is permitted. All their rites resemble those of the Dhdnaks,t and 
Chamarw^ Brahmans officiate at their weddings and like occasions. 
The N^iks, who form a superior class among the Heris, resemble 
them in all respects, having the same gots and following the same 
pursuits, but the two groups do oot intermarry or even take water 
from each other's hands. On the other hand the Aheri is said to 
be dubbed Thori as a term of contempt, and possibly the two tribes 
are really the same. 

For accounts of the Aheris in the United Provinces, see Elliot's 
Glossary. 

Ahie. The name Ahir is doubtless derived from the Sanskrit ahhira, a 
milkman, but various other folk etymologies are current. J 

The Ahirs' own tradition as to their origin is, that a Brahman once 
took a Vaisya girl to wife and her offspring were pronounced amat' 
sangyd or outcast ; that again a daughter of the amat-sangyds married 
a Brahman, and that her offspringr were called ahhirs {i.e., Gop^s or 
herdsmen), a word corrupted into Ahir. 

They are chiefly found in the south of Dehli, Gurgdon, and Rohtak 
and the Phulki^n States bordering upon these districts, and in this 

• Ahen's also work in reeds and grass, especially at making winnowing-baskets and 
stools of reed. 

t The Aheris claim that they will not take water from a Dhinak, as the Chuhras do. 
Yet they rank no higher than the latter, since they eat dead animals, although they will 
cot remove filth. 

X One of these is ahi-dr, " snake-killer," due to the fact that Sri Krishna had once killed 
a snake. But according to the Mad-Bhagwat, Askaad 10, Addhiyae 17, Sri Krishna did'^oa 
kill the snake, but brought it out of the Jumna.

The first historical mention of the Abhiras occurs in the confused 
statements of the Vishnu Parana concerning them and the Sakas 
Yavanas, Bahlikas and other outlandish dynasties which succeeded 
the Andhras in the 3rd century A. D. 

In the 4th century the Abhfrap, Arjundyanas and Malavas are de- 
scribed as republican tribes settled in eastern Rdjpnt^na and Malwa.* 
They are divided into three hhdwps or sub-castes : — 

(1) the Nandbansi, who call themselves the offspring of Nandil, the 

foster-father of Sri Krishna.t 

(2) the Jdduhansiy who claim to be descendants of the Yadu, a 

nomadic race. 

(3) the Gudlhanai, who say that they are descended from the Gu51d 

or ' herdsman ' dynasty and the Gopis, who danced with the 
god Krishna in the woods of Bindraban and Gokal. 
The Jadubansi Ahirs are mostly found in the Ahirwati J and Haridna, 

while the Nandbansis and Gudlbansis are found in Mathura and 

Bindraban, 

All three sub-castes are endogamous and avoid four gots in marriage.

* V. A. Smith, Ancient History of India, pp. 240 and 250, 

t Sri Krishna, through fear of Raja, Kans, was changed for Nand's daughter and so 
brought up by him. Nand was an Ahir ; Krishna, a Kshatrya. J4du was the son of Jaeat 
from whom Krishna was descended, and the Jadubansi also claim descent from him ' 

t Another account says that the Ahirwati is held by the Jadubansi and Nandbansf 
who smoke together, whereas the Gualbansi will not smoke u-ith them (in spite of the 
latters' inferiority). 

It is not easy to define the boundaries of Ahirwati. It includes Rewari and the country 
to the west of it ; R4th or Bighauta lying to the south-west of that town and apparently 
overlapping it since Narnaul appears to lie in the Riiix as well as in the Ahirwatf. 



Ahir origins. 

56. Bhanotra, originally Nathawat Rajputs, from' Amla Bhanera 
in Jaipur: their ancestor committed murder and fled, finding a refuge 
with the Ahirs : and 

57. Ddyar, originally Tun war Rajputs till 995 Sambat : the legend 
is that Anangpal had given his daughter in marriage to Kalu R^ja of 
Dhiirc4nao-ar, but her husband gave her vessels for her separate use, and 
she complained to her father. Anangpal would have attacked his 
son-in-law but his nobles dissuaded him, and so he treacherously invited 
Kdlu to his second daughter's wedding. Kdlu came with his four 
brothers, Parmar, Nil, Bhawan and Jagpdl, but they learnt of the plot 
and fled to the Ahirs, from whom Kdlu took a bride and thus founded 
the Ddyar got. 

Some of the Nandbansi gots are : — 



1. Bachhwdl. 

2. Harbanwal. 

3. Kaholi. 



4. Khatban. 

5. Pachary^. 

6. Rabar. 
7. Sanwary^. 

The Ahirs again give their name to the Ahirwati dialect, which is 
spoken in the tract round Ndrnaul, Kanaudh and Rew^ri. It differs 
little, if at all, from the ordinary Hindi of the south-east Punjab ; * for 
a full account of it and its local varieties the reader must be referred to 
the Linguistic Survey of India, Vol. IX, pp. 49 — 51 and 233 — 241. 

The Ahirs are all Hindus, but in spite of their traditional connec- 
tion with Sri Krishna,t they affect Shivaji, Devi and Thdkarji. They 
also worship Bandeo, whose shrine is at Raipur in the Bawal nizamat 
of Ndbha and who is said to be a black snake : hence no Ahir will kill 
a black snake. In Saharanpur their marriage deities are Braha and 
Bar deotas, but no traces of these cults are noted in the Punjab. | 

Ahir women dress differently to those of the Jdt tribes, wearing 
red and yellow striped gowns, with a shawl of red muslin. But in 
Jind they are said to wear a gown {lenghd) of blue cloth. 

The Ahirs were probably by origin a pastoral caste, but in the 
.Punjab they are now almost exclusively agricultural, and stand in 
quite the first rank as husbandmen, being as good as the Kamboh 
and somewhat superior to the Jat. They are of the same social 
standing as the Jd,t and Gujar, who will eat and smoke with them ; 
but they have not been, at any rate within recent times, the dominant 
race in any considerable tract. Perhaps their nearest approach to 
such a position was in the State of Rampur near Rewdri, whose last 
chief, Rao Tula Rd-m, mutinied in 1857 and lost his state. His family 
still holds a jdgir and its members are addressed as Rao, a title which 
is indeed grateful to every Ahir. 

They are industrious, patient, and orderly ; and though they 
are ill spoken of in the proverbs of the country side, yet that is prob- 
ably only because the Jdt is jealous of them as being even better 
cultivators than himself. Thus they say ii). Rohtak : " Kosli (the head 

* C. R. 1891, p. 263. 

t Still, according to Mr. Maclagan, Krishna is their patron, C. R. 1891, p. 120. Moreover, 
they adopt Brahman or Bairagi gnrus, receiving from them a kanthi (necklace) and the 
Krishna-mantra in return for a hket or pujd of Rs. 2 or 3.

village of the Ahirs) has fifty brick houses and Bovoral thousand 
swaggerers." So in Delhi : " Rather be kicked by a Rajput or stumble 
uphill, than hope anything from a jackal, spear grass, or an Ahir" ; 
and again: "All castus are God's creatures, but three castes are 
ruthless, when they get a chance they have no shame : the whore, 
the Bdnya, and the Ahir." The phrase Ahir be-plr refers to their sup- 
posed faithlessness. But these stigmas arc, now-a-days at least, wholly 
undeserved. 

Their birth, death and marriage ceremonies are like those of tho 
Mdlis, Gujars and Jatg. Kareiva is permissible, but in Jind, it is said, 
a widow may not marry her husband's elder brother and this is also 
the case in Gurg^n, where some of the higher Ahir families disallow 
widow re-marriage in toto* and hold aloof from other Ahirs. Like 
the Rdjputs the Ahirs recognise concubinage, and a father has a right 
to the guardianship of a concubine's son [b-uretiocil) , bat ho does not 
inherit. The Ahirs who disallow widow re-marriage also follow the 
rule of ch{indavand,f 

They eat kachchi and pahht with all Brahmans and Vaisyas, but the 
latter do not oat hachchi from them. They will eat kachchi with Raj- 
puts, Jats, Hindu Gujars, Rors, Sunars and Tarkhans, while the latter 
eat also with tho former. They do not eat flesh. { 

In and around Delhi city the Ahir is also known as Ghosi and 
claims descent from Nandji, adopted father of Krishna (Kanliyaii). 
Anciently called Gwdlds the Ahirs were called Ghosi after their conver- 
sion to Isk'im§, but any cowman or milkseller ia also called ghosi. 
The principal Ahir or Ghosi gots are :— 

Mukhiall which ranks highest of all the gots. 

Charia (graziers). 

Ghur-charha (cavalry men) and Kasab. 

Tho Hindu Ghosi customs resemble those of tho Hindu Rtljputg. A 
Gaur Brahman officiates at the fhera rite in marriage. The Ghosi 
have a system of imnches and hereditary chaudhris. If ono of the 
latter's line fail, his widow may adopt a son to succeed him, or, failing 
such adoption, the panch elects a fit person. 

A very full description of the Ahirs will bo found in Elliott's Races of the North-Wett 
Provinces, and also in Shcrring, I, 332 fi. 

Ahlawat, a J^t tribe, said to be descended from a Chauhdn Rajput who 
came from Sambhar in Jaipur some 30 generations ago. From him 
sprang the Ahlawat, Olian, Kirma, JMare, and Jun Jats who do not 
intermarry. Tho tribe is found in Rohtak, Delhi, and Karndl, Its 
members worship a common ancestor called Sadu Dob.

§ Tho meaning appears to be that any Muhammadan who became a cowman by trade was 
caUed Ghosi, and that this name then became applied to any Ahir or Gwala, so that we now 
find the Hindu Ahir as well as liis Miahammadan competitor commonly called Ghosi. 

II MuliMa, ' spokesman,' is also a title given to a leading member of the caste, but it doM 
not appear to be equivalent to chaudhri. 



d', Ahl-i'Eadis'^Ahmadzai. 

Ahl-i-Hadi!^, or " Pcoplu of the Tradition," formerly styled WaMbis 
from the name of their founder. The Ahl-i-Hadis are Musalman 
purists. •* They accept the six books of traditions as collecied by the 
Sunnis, but reject the subsequent glosses of the fathers and the voice 
of the church, and claim liberty of conscience and the right of private 
interpretation. They insist strongly upon the unity of God, which 
doctrine they say has been endangered by the reverence paid by the 
ordinary Musalmdn to Muhammad, to the Imdms and to saints ; and 
forbid the offering of prayer to any prophet, priest or saint, even as a 
mediator with the Almighty. They condemn the sepulchral honours 
paid to holy men, and illumination of, visits to, and prostration before, 
their shrines, and even go so far as to destroy the domes erected over 
their remains. They call the rest of the Muhammadana " Mushrik," 
or those who associate another with God, and strenuously proclaim that 
Muhammad was a mere mortal man. They disallow the smoking of 
tobacco as unlawful, and discountenance the use of rosaries or beads. 
Apparently they insist much upon the approaching appearance of the 
last Imdm Mahdi preparatory to the dissolution of the world. Politically 
their most important and obnoxious opinion is that they are bound 
to wage war against all infidels. The orthodox deny them the title of 
Musalmans." 

A full history of the " Ahl-i-Hadis " is beyond the scope of this 
article. Its founder, Abdul- Wahhab, was born in Nejd in 1691 A. D., 
and his successors reduced the whole of Nejd and then overran the 
Hijaz. In 1809 their piracies compelled the Government of Bombay 
to capture their stronghold on the coast of Kirman, and in 1-81 1-1 8 the 
Sultan of Turkey beheaded their chief and reduced them to political 
insignificance. Their doctrines were introduced into India by Sayyid 
Ahmad Shah of Rai Bareli, originally a free-booter who, after a visit 
to Arabia, proceeded to the North- West Frontier, and there, in 1826, 
proclaimed a jihad, or religious war against the Sikhs. His extra- 
ordinary ascendency over the tribes of the Peshdwar Border and hia 
four years' struggle, not wholly unsuccessful, with the Durrani s on the 
one hand and on the other with the Sikhs, and his ultimate defeat and 
death are described in James' Settlement Rejwrt of Peshawar (pp. 
43-44) and more fully in Bellew's History of Yiisufzai (pp. 83—102). 
Patna is the head-quarters of the sect in India, but it has also colonies 
at Polosi on the Indus and at Sittana and Malka in Yusufzai beyond 
Buner.

Akali. The sect of the Akalis differs essentially from all the other Sikh 
orders in being a militant organization, corresponding to the Ndgas 
or Gosains among the Hindus. Their foundation is ascribed to (Juru 
Govind* himself, and they steadfastly opposed Baoda's attempted 
innovations. The term t is sometimes said to be derived from ahdll- 
jmrusha 'worshipper of tho Eternal.' But ahdl meaus ' deathless,' i.e., 
' God,' and Akdli is simply < God's worshipper.' The Akdlis wear blue 
chequered dresses,^ and bangles or bracelets of steel round their wrists, 
and quoits of steel in their lofty conical blue turbans, together with 
miniature daggers, knives, and an iron chain. § 

In their military capacity the Akalis were called Nihang, || or reckless, 
and played a considerable part in the Sikh history, forming the Shahids

J Malcolm points out that Krishna's elder brother, Bal Ram, wore blue clothes, whence ho 
is called Nilambari, or 'clad in dark blue,' and Sitivas, or 'the blue clad ' {Asiatick lie- 
searches xi, p. 221). 

§ Strict Akalis do not wear the jatd or top-knot, but some do. Those who do not only 
use 'dur and Inta' water and also smoke, which tho ./a/d wearers may not do. Others, 
again, wear a yellow turban beneath the blue one, so as to show a yellow band across tho 
forehead. The story goes that a Khatri of Delhi (Nand Lai, author of tlio Zi>id<i,jindmn) 
desired to see the Gurii in yellow, and Govind Singh gratified his wish. Many Sikhs wear tho 
yellow turban at tho Basant Panchmi. Acouplet erroneously ascribed to Bhai Gurdas says : 
Sidh, sufcd, jo ptihnc, 
8urk)i, zarddc, soi Giirbhdi.

are all brothers in the Guru. '

or iirst of the i'our dehras. At the siege o£ Multan in 1818 a few 
A kill i fanatics'^ carried the faussebraye by surprise, and precipitated 
the fall of that fortress. The career of Phuld Singh illustrates 
both their defects and their qualities. This great Akali first came into 
notice as the leader of the attack on Metcalfe's escort at Amritsar in 
1809. lie was then employed by Ran jit Singh, who stood in consider- 
able awe of him, as a leader in the Indus valley, where he was guilty 
of atrocious cruelty towards the Muhammadan population, and ia 
Kashmir. Finally, Phula Singh and his Akdlis contributed to, or 
rather virtually won for Ranjit Singh, the great Sikh victory over the 
Yiisafzais at Teri in 1823. In this battle Phuld, Singh met with a 
heroic death, and his tomb at Naushahra is now an object of pilgrimage 
to Hindus and Muhammadans alike. 

Under Phula Singh's earlier leadership, and perhaps before his 
rise, the Akdlis had become a terror to friends and foes alike, and 
they were dreaded by the Sikh chiefs, from whom they often levied 
contributions by force. t Ranjit Singh, after 1823, did much to re- 
duce their power, and the order lost its importance. 

The Akdli headquarters were the Akal Bunga X at Amritsar, where 
they assumed the direction of religious ceremonies and the duty of 
convoking the Gurumat^; indeed, they laid claim to exercise a 
general leadership of the Khalsa. Since Ranjit Singh's time Anandpur 
has been their real headquarters, but their iufluence has to a large ex- 
tent passed away, and some of them have degenerated into mere 
buffoons. 

As an order the Akdlis are celibate. They have, says Trumpp, no 
regular chief or disciple, yet one hears of their Gurus, whose leavings 
are eaten by their disciples {seivak or chela). They do not eat meat 
or drink spirits, as other Sikhs do, but consume inordinate quantities 
of hhang.

that on visiting the temple (sic) of the Akalis at Amritsar, the stranger piesents a few 
rupees and in return receives some sugar, while a small mirror is held before his face so 
as to reflect his image. This practice, if it ever eiisted, is now obsolete.

Mecca,* and those ^vho claim descent from those men stylo themselves 
Ansdri. Ono of the most interestiuK Ansari families in the ]\injab Ib 
that of the Ansilri Shaikhs of Jullundur. It claims descent from 
Khalid ' Ansar' (Abii Ayub), who reoeivod Muhammad in his house at 
M ad ina, til rough Shaikhs Yusuf and Siraj-ud-din (Shaikh Darwesh). 
From the latter was descended the Pir Keshan, founder of the Koshanias. 
These Ansarifl are said by Raverty to be of Tajik extraction. They in- 
termarry with the Barkis or Barikkis of Jullundur who aro Path;ins.

the Mahratta chief, the Apa Sdhib, and a worshipper of the Ganges. 
The sect is mainly found in Rohtak and Hiss.i.r. 

'Arab, a Jat clan (agricultural), found in Multan. [It is very doubtful if the 
Arabs of the Census returns are true Arabs, though there may be a few 
Arab merchants, etc., found occasionally at such centres as Peshdwar 
and Multan. It is possible that a certain number of Quresbis, Shaikhs 
and others return themselves as Arabs.] 

Aeain, Rain (the latter form prevails in the Jumna valley), is a term which 
has at least two distinct meanings : in the Sutlej valley and throughout 
the eastern plains the Arains form a true caste, but in all the rest of 
the two Provinces the term i^i applied to any market-gardener and is 
synonymous with Baghbdn, Mali, Maliar, and oven JiU in the South- 
Wesfe Punjab. We are now concerned with the Arains as a caste. 

Almost to a man Muhammadansand strongly inclined to orthodoxy, t 
the Arains claim to be immigrants from Uch and have some affinities with 
the Kambohs. On the other hand some of the Arain and Hindu Saini 
clan names are identical, and those not always merely names of other 
and dominant tribes. From Uch they migrated to Sirsa and thenco into 
the Punjab. 

In Sirsa the Sutlej Arains meet those of the Ghaggar. The two do 
not intermarry, but the Arains of the Ghaggar valley say they were 
Rajputs living on the Panjnad near Multdn who were ejected some 
four centuries ago by Saiyad Jakil-ul-diu of Uch. They claim some 
sort of connection with Jaisalmer. Till the great famines of 1759 
and 1783 A. D. they are said to have held all the lower valleys of the 
Choya and Ghaggar, but after the latter date the Bhattis harassed the 
Sumnis, the country became disturbed, and many of the Arains emi- 
grated across the Ganges and settled near Bareli and Rilmpur. They 
marry only with the Ghaggar and Bareli Arains. The Sutlej Arains 

* See Muir's Li/e of Muhammad, p. 188-89 (abridged edition). The viuhdjarin were the 
refugees who accompanied Muhammad, but the two names are sometimes confuwed. For 
further details see Tcmple'a Legends of the Punjab, III. The Saintu of Jalandhar and 
D. G. Barkley, in P. N. Q, II. 

t So much so that in Ambdia the Shaikhs, though really often identical with the Bains, 
arrogate to themselves a much higher place in the social scale. 



14 Arain groups, 

in Siraa say that they are, like the Arains of Lahore and Montgomery, 
connected by origin with the Hindu Kambohs. Mr. Wilson thinks it 
probable that both classes are really Kambohs who have become 
Mu sal mans, and that the Ghaggar Arain s emigrated in a body from 
Multan, while tlie others moved gradually up the Sutlej into their 
present place. He describes the Arains of the Ghaggar as the most 
advanced and civilised tribe in the Sirsa district, even surpassing the 
Sikh Jdts from Patidla ; and he considers them at least equal in social 
status with the Jd-ts, over whom they themselves claim superiority. 
The Arains of Ferozepore^ Ludhidna, Ambd,la and Hissar also trace 
their origin from Uch* or its neighbourhood, though the Hissar Arains 
are said to be merely Muhammadan Malis. 

On the whole it would appear probable that the Arains originally 
came from the lower Indus and spread up the five rivers of the Punjab; 
and that at an early stage in their history a section of them moved 
up the Ghaggar, perhaps then a permanent river flowing into the 
Indus, and there gained for themselves a position of some importance. 
As the Ghaggar dried up and the neighbouring country became more 
arid, they moved on into the Jumna districts and cis- Sutlej tract 
.srenerally, and perhaps spread along the foot of the hills across the 
line of movement of their brethren who where moving up the valleys 
of the larger rivers. Their alleged connection with the Malis is probably 
based only upon common occupation ; but there does seem some reason 
to think that they may perhaps be akin to the Kambohs, though the 
difference must be more than one of religion only, as many of the 
Kambohs are Musalm^n. 

In Amb^la the Rains are divided into two territorial groups, Mult^ni 
and Sirsawald. The former regard themselves as Shaikhs and will not 
intermarry with the latter.

In Gujrat the Wahand, Khokhar, Bagga and Nain do not intermarry 
with tho Kamboh and Khohara sections — whom they regard as 
inferior. 

The nucleus of this caste was probably a body of Hindu Saini or 
Kamboh cultivators who were converted to Isldm at an early period. 
Thus in Jullundur the Arains say they came from Sirsa, Rania and 
Dehli and claim descent from Rai Jaj (grandson of Lau, founder of 
Lahore), who ruled Sirsa: that they were converted in tho I2th 
century and migrated to the Jullundur Doab about 300 years ago. 
But the Bhuttaa claim descent from Raja, Bhiita, fifth in descent from 
Rdjji Karn and say they were forcibly converted even earlier— by 
Mahmud of Ghazni — and driven from Uch : —

and dress from the Muhammadans generally. In Mnltan they prcicr the 
blue mnjJild or waistoloth to the white and those of one village (Jalla in 
Lodhran tahsil) are in consequence known as the nili imltan or ' blue 
regiment.' 

Akaii. Arr, a tribe of Muhammadans of Jat status found in Dipdlpur tahsil, 
Montgomery District, where they are settled along the Lahore border on 
the upper course of the Khan wall canal. They claim Mughal descent, 
yet say ihey caiiie from Arabia, and are fairly good cultivators. Their 
ancestor came from Delhi, where he was in service 500 years ago, and 
settled in their present seat. By contracting marriages with J^ts they 
have sunk to J at status. In the Minchinabad nizdmat of Bahawalpur 
they are to be found intermarrying with, or giving daughters to, the 
Wattus. Also found in Shdhpur, and classed as agricultural in both 
districts. 

Akbi a Muhammadan clan, said co be of Arabian origin, which was, in 
Mughal times, given several villages round Multan, but it has now to a 
large extent lost its hold of them. It is classed as Jiit (agricultural) 
both in Multan and Montgomery and is also found in the Ahmadpur 
East tahsil of Bahawalpur. 

Aek a tribe of Muhammadan J^ts, found in Jind, whose members ai 
said to still revere their jathera Sain Dd,s' shrine, and to give the 
dhidnis Re. 1 at weddings in hia name. 

Arke an Arain clan (agricultural), found in Amritsar. 

Arora, or Rora as it is often pronounced, is the leading caste par 
excellence of the Jatki-speaking, or south-western part of the Punjab, 
i.e. of the lower reaches of the five rivers and, below their junction, of 
the Panjnad, extending through Bahawalpur into Sind. Higher up 
the courses of the five rivers the Arora shares that position with the 
Khattri. The caste is wider spread and far more numerous than the 
Bhdtia, but fully half the Arords of the Punjab dwell in the Multan 
division and the Deraj^t ; though the caste is found, like the Khattri, 
throughout Afghanistan and even Turkestan. Like the Khattri again, 
but unlike the Bania, the Arord. is no mere trader, but will turn his 
hand to anything. He is an admiratble cultivator, and a large 
proportion of the Aroras on the lower Chenab are purely agricultural, 
while in the Western Punjab he will sew clothes, weave matting and 
baskets, make vessels of brass and copper, and do goldsmith's work. 
Despite his inferior physique, he is active and enterprising, industrious 
and thrifty. "When an Arora girds up his loins (says a Jhang 
proverb), ho makes it only two miles to Lahore.""^ 

In Bahawalpur the Aroras are very numerous and have the whole 
of its trade in their hands, dealing in every commodity, and even 
selling shoes and vegetables. Some are contractors, hankers or money- 
lenders, and in the latter capacity they have now acquired a considerable 
amount of land by mortgage or purchase from Muhammadan owners. 



* A variant of this proverb current in Gujrinwala is Lak badha Aroridn, te munna 
koh Lahor—' if the Aroras gird up their loins, they make it only three-fouiths of a kos to 
iiahore.'

Arora groups', 17 

thougli 40 or 50 years ago they did not own an acre of cultivated land. 
In the service of the State more Arords than Mubummadans are 
employed, though the latter are nearly Hix times as namerous as the 
former. As several land-owning families have been ruined in their 
dealings with Arords such sayings^ as Kirdr howl yur, dusJiman dhdr 
na dhdr, " he who has a Kirar for a friend, needs not aD enemy," are 
current in the State. t 

By religion the great majority of the Aroras are Hindus, but a good 
many are Sikhs. 

Asa body the Arords claim to be Khattrig and say that like them 
they were dispersed by Paras Rdm. Folk etymology indeed avers that 
when so persecuted they denied their caste and described it as a7cr 
or 'other,' whence 'Arora'; but another tradition, current in Gujrat, 
Fays they were driven by Paras Rilm towards Multiin near which tboy 
founded Arorkot. Cursed by a faqir the town became desolate and 
the Arorfis fled by its three gates, on the North, South and "West, 
whence the three main groups into which they are now divided. But 
certain sections claim a different origin. The ruins of Arorkot are 
said to be near Rohri in Sindh.J 

The Arora caste is organised in a very similar way to theKhattris. 
Its primary divisions are the genealogical sections, as in all Hindu 
castes, but it has three or four territorial groups : — 

1. Uttarddhi, Northern. 

2. Dakhana or Dakhanadhain, Southern. 1 Sometimes classed as 

3. Dahrd, Western. | one group. 

4. Sindhi, of Sindh. 

Numbers 2 and 3 intermarry in some parts, bnt not in others. In 
Jhang they do not, but in Fazilka they are said to have begun to 
do so. The probability is that the Dakhand still take wives from the 
Dahnl group, as they used to do.§ 

The Uttaradhi sub-caste appears to be absolutely endogamoua east 
of the Indus, except in Bahdwalpur where it takes wives from the 
other three groups : in Hazara whore it occasionally takes them from 

* Kirir, a term applied by Muhammadans to any Hindu shoj -keeper or trader, is by no 
means equivalent to Arora, see s. n. Kirar. 

t The justice of Iho above quotation from the draft Gazettcpr of the Bnhawalpur State 
is disputed, and it is pointed out that the earlier Daudpotra rulers of Bah4walpur employed 
Arovas in positions of trust, and even appointed them to semimilitary office as Uakhsliis or 
paymasters. At present the Aroj-as are losing ground, especially in the liigher grades of the 
State service. 

X A correspondent, referring to the Arorham AoU, an Urdu pamphlet published by the 
Khatri Samachar Prps3, Lahore, edds some interesting details. The pamphlet appears to be 
based in a History of the Arorbans inNaprri and the Bhu Sufr (Oricin of the World) Punln. 
In the latter is piven a dialogue between Parasu Rama and Art, a Khatri, in wliich the latter 
stoutly refuses to oppose the Brahmans and wins Parasu Kama's respect, being advJRed by him 
to settle in Sindh. The pamphlet also ascribes a sectarian origin to the Arora proups. and 
declares that in 10.5 Vikrami social dissensions arose at Arorkot among the Aroras, so their 
purohit Gosain Sidh Bhoj convened a meetiner at which the upholders of the old customs sat 
to the north, the reformers to the south and the moderates or neutrals to the west. 
Accordingly the North of Arorkot. was assigned to the conservatives and the South to 
both the other parties, a fact which explains why the Dakhauis and Dahras are sometimes 
regarded as one and the same.

And of these numbers 1-7 intermarry, but will only take wives from 
numbers 8-12, and there is a further tendency on the part of numbers 
1-5 to discontinue giving daughters to numbers 6 and 7. In the 
south-east of the Punjab the Bdri and Bunjahi groups exist both 
among the Northern and Southern Arords.t 

A list of the Arord gats or sections will be found in Appendix I to this 
Volume. 

There are a few sections, e.g., Sachdeo, Lund, Bazaz and others, 
which are found in more than one of the territorial groups. The Sethi 
section may possibly be the same as the Seth or Sethi Section of the 
Khattris. The Rassewat or ropemakers are clearly by origin an occupa- 
tional section like the Bazdz or clothiers. 

The names ending in jd are beyond all question patronymics. Others 
such as Budhraja or Bodhrdji suggest a religious origin. 

The Gosain Mule-santie claim to be descendants of a Gaur Brahman 
who came to the Jhang District and assumed the name of the Guruwdrd 
section, but became a devotee or gosain who made converts. 

Other sections have various traditions as to their origins : Thus the 
Ndrangs say they were originally Raghbansis who denied their race 
when Paras Ram destroyed the Khattris, with the words nd rag, ' No 
RaghbanBi.' Ndrag became Narang. The Chikur, a sub-section of the 
Sachdeos are so called because on a marriage in that section sweet- 
meats were as plentiful as mud (chikur). Naruld is derived from wirdZa, 
* unique,' because once a snake got into the churn when a woman was 
making butter, so the men of this section never churn, though its 
women may. 

The Gogias or Gogas have a saying : 

Khat khuh, hhar pdni, Tan tani parsing Gogidni.' 

i.e., they say to a would-be son-in-law: 

' Dig a well and fill it with water. Then marry a Gogiani. 

* Trans-Indus Captain O'Brien notes a solitary case of a girl of the Jam section (Uttari- 
dhi) being given to a Kumbhar (Dakhana).

Arora totem sections. 



IS 



As in other castes some sections of the Arojas are credited wita 
inherited curative powers. Thus the Dalewdnia of Janipur can cure 
hydrophobia by spitting on a httle earth and applyin<j it to the bite. 
This power was conferred on their forbears by the blessinr^ of their 
'pir, tho saint of Daira Din Pand-h. The Duds^ have an inherited power 
of curing a sprain in the back or loins by touching the part affected. 
The pain called chuk may also be cured by this section which uses tho 
following charm: — 'Dun, sith bdri, i^Jmlon hhari dari, hhannv chit 
(waist) karcndd sari.' The charm is read over a cloth and this is then 
applied thrice to the part, a push being finally given to it to expel 
the pain. The power was conferred on Seth Hari, the ancestor of 
tho section, by faqirs. It is also said to be essential that the patient 
should go straight home without looking back. The power is exercised 
gratis. 

A man of tho Chugh got can cure chuh or pain in tho loinst by 
pushing tho sufferer from behind. If a Chugh is not on band, it in 
sufficient to go to his house and rub one's back against the wall. 
Chugh may bo derived from chuk, because the tribe has this power, 
but perhaps the idea is simply that a Chugh has power over chuk. It 
can also be cured by a family of Dhingr^ Arords of Bajanpur who 
apply a part of their clothing to the part affected and push the 
patient thrice, or if none of them are present their house- wall is as 
efficacious as a Chugh. 

Several Arora sections are named after animals such as : — 



Babbar (? 1) in Montgomery. 

Chutdni,t bat. 

Gaba, calf. 

Ghira, dove, Montgomery and 
Multdn. 

Giddar, jackal. 

Ghord, horse, Dora Ismail Khan. 

Hans, goose, Montgomery. 

Kukar,§ Kukkar, cock, Mont- 
gomery, Multan and Hissar. 

Kukreja, cockerell, Dera Ismail 
Khan. 



Lumar, fox, Montgomery. 

Machhar, mosquito, Gujrat. 

Makkar, locust, Gujrat. 

Menddi (?) ram or Mindhd, long- 
haired, Montgomery. 

Nangidl, snake, Dora Ismail 
Khan. 

Nag-pdl, Nang-pdl.II 

Nangru. 

(?) Sipra, a serpent. 



Other sections are named from pla)its, etc., and are perhaps more 
likely to be totemistic. Such are :— 



ChdwaM, rice. 

Gerd, said to avoid the use of 

ochre, gerii, (in Dera lemail 

Khdn). 
Gheia, fr. ghi, clarified butter. 



Jandwdni, named after the j and 
tree in Dera Ismail Khan. 

Kasturia, said to avoid tho use of 
musk, kadilri, (Dora Ismail 
Kluin). 



* In Hissar this section of the Aroras may not wear blue Unghd (trousers). 

t A child born feet foremost can euro pain in the loins by kicking the part alTcctecI; 

t Chutini, bat : a child was once attacked by bats, which, however, left him uninjured. 
The section worships bats' nests (chnruchitti) at marriages. 

§ The Kukar will not eat fowls, but most Hindus have a prejudice against them as food 
and in this very caste the Mchndiratta have for the last 12 or 14 years refused to eat them 
too. 

II Nangpal does not appear to mean ' snake,' but protector or raiser of snakes.

Veh-khani, Vid-khd,m poison-eater : fr. veh or viit, 'poison ', in the 

Sindhi dialect as spoken in Bahawalpur. Possibly arsenic is meant. 
With regard to the sections mentioned as existing in Dera Isnaail 

Khan, it is distinctly said that each shows reverence to the animal 

or plant after which it is named, thinking it sacred. The animal is 

fed, and the plant not cut or injured. The Chdwal^s, however, do not 

abstain from using rice, or show it any respect. 

The women of the Uttarddhi group wear red ivory bracelets (and 

affect red petticoats with a red border, in Ferozepore), whence this 

group is styled Ldlchuriwdld, 

The Dakhand women wear white ivory bracelets (and also affect 

red petticoats, the lower part 'laced ' with hlacJc^), 

By gotra the Aroras, in Gujrat at least, are said to bo Kushal, but 
their real gotra appears to be Kasib, ? Kishab or Keshav. 

At weddings the Uttarddhis in Ferozepore are said to have a distinc- 
tive custom in the do rate phere, i.e., the boy's party must reach the 
bride's house on the afternoon of the 5th if the date fixed be the 6th 
or night of the 7th and the viilni must be on the 5th-6th. Dakhnds

that in some places Dahra women alone wear white, and Dakhanas spotted bracelets of both 
colours.

Holemnized by tho couple going out and circumambulating burning 
reeds. The Brahmans recognise widow marriage and assist at it, in 
fact if it is solemnised without a Brahman, people refrain from eating 
or drinking with the couple for a short time. 

The customary law of the Aroras differs both from Hindu Law and 
the ordinary Punjab Custom. In its main features it resembles that 
of the Hindus generally in the south-west Punjab, and one of its 
distinctive features is tho 6'au"ai, an extra quarter share which <''oes to 
the eldest son. Many Arord sections allow sons by the wife of 
another caste provided she was married as a virgin, not as a widow 
one-third of their father^s property, two-thirds going to tho sons by 
the other (Arora) wife. The position of daughters and sisters is more 
favourable than it usually is among Hindus under the Punjab Custom.*

all the other Jat tribes of that tahsil. Also found in Multau, where it

AiiYA Samaj. — By far the most important modern Hindu sect in the Punjab, 
the Arya Samaj was founded about 1847 by Paudit Dayanand JSaras- 
wati, a Brahman of Kathiawar. Born in 1824, Uayanand had an 
equal aversion to idolatry and marriage, and aftei- profound researches 
in Sanskritic lore ha founded a samdj or union at Lahore soon after 
1847 — and subsequently in the rest of the Punjab. The latter 
part of his life was spent in travels in the Unitca Provinces and 
Kajputana. His attacks on existing Hinduism roused great antagonism. 
He insisted on a special interpretation of the Vedas and left behind him 
several works such as the Vede Bhdtshya, or translation of the Vedas, 
the SatydHh Frahash in which tho Arya religion is contrasted with 
others, and the Bhumka, an introduction to the study of the Vedas. 

" The Arya or ' Vedic' religion", writes Mr. Maclagan," is primarily 
the outcome of the solvent action of natural science on modern 
Hinduism. Tho members of tho Arya Samaj find the fantastical 
representations of the world and of man which are put forward in the 
eighteen Puriinas to be inconsistent with natural science, and so reject 
their authority, looking on them as the outcome of the ignorance and 
craft of comparatively recent generations of Brahmans. The original 
and only authoritative scriptures in the eyes of the Arya kSamaj are 
the four Vedas, and its professed aim is to restore the paramount 
authority of the Vedas by purging away subsequent accretions. Scrip- 
tures more recent than the Vedas and anterior to the Puranas (such 
as the Brahmaniis, the six philosophic Darshanas, the ten Upanishads, 
etc.), are regarded OS explanatory of the Vedas and authoritative only 
where they are not contradictory thereto. The Vedas themselves con- 
stitute the only infallible revelation. — 'The Vedas', wrote Dayanand, 

* are revealed by God. 1 regard them as self-evident truth, admitting 
of no doubt and depending on the authority of no other book, being

22 Arya Samdj doctrines. 

reprosontod in nature, the kingdom of God.' The bases of the Aryan 
I'aith are the revelation of God in the Vedas and in Nature, and the first 
pructicul element in this belief is the interpretation of the Vedas in 
conformity with the proved results of natural science. 

In the interpretation of the Vedas the Arya Sani^j finds itself at 
issue with the Sanskritists of Europe, whose translations represem 
the Vedaa as the religious literature ot a primitive people and, like the 
literature of other primitive peoples, quite regardless of, and inconsist- 
ent with, scientific accuracy. The Aryas contend that such a view 
arises from a mistaken literal translation of their scriptures, and that 
the earlier, and consequently more trustworthy, commentators having 
always refused to construe the Vedas in their literal sense, it is a 
mistaken view to suppose that they were originally composed with 
any meaning other than a metaphorical or derived one. FolloAving 
these principles, the Samdj not only defends the Vedic rishis from all 
imputations of pantheism and polytheism, but finds in their writings 
numerous indications of an accurate acquaintance with the facts of 
science. It holds that cremation, vegetarianism, and abstinence from 
spirituous liquors are inculcated by the Vedas, and inculcated to a 
laro-e extent on purely scientific grounds. It l)olds that the great 
relio"iousrite of Vedic times, the agnihotra or homa sacrifice, is instituted 
with a view to rendering air and water wholesome and subservient to 
health, and because ' it plays a prominent part in putting a atop to 
the prevalence of epidemics and the scarcity of rainfall.' It is con- 
Tinced that the latest discoveries of science, such as those of electricity 
and evolution, were perfectly well known to the seers who were in- 
spired to write the Vedas. 

"While conceding this much to modern natural science, the Aryas 
refuse to see in it anything tending to materialism or atheism. Retain- 
ino- their confidence in the Vedas, they have avoided the radical 
materialism of some of the earlier opponents of popular Hinduism. 
The Arya philosophy is orthodox, and based mainly on the Upanishads. 
The tenets of Daydnand, though leaning rather to the Shankya doc- 
trine, do not fit in precisely with any one of the six orthodox systems ; 
but these systems are all regarded by the Aryas as true and as differ- 
ent aspects of the same principles. The three entities of Dayanand's 
philosophy are God, the Soul and praJcriti or Matter. Soul he regarded 
as physically distinct from God, but related to Him as the contained 
to the container, the contemplated to the contemplator, the son to the 
father. Soul enters into all animals and there are indications of soul 
in the vegetable kingdom also. In most of its details the Aryan system 
retains the terminology of the traditional philosophy of Hinduism. 
It maintains above all things the law of metempsychosis and places 
the aim of virtue in escape from the law ; but this moksh or beatitude 
is for an era {kalp) only, after the termination of which the soul 
resumes its wanderings. The localization of the Hindu paradises, 
Parlok and Swarg, is rejected : heaven and hell lie in the pleasures and 
sorrows of the feoul, whether these be in this life or in the life to come. 

As a consequence of this doctrine it holds the futility of rites on 
behalf of the dead, and by this cuts at the root of that great Hindu 
inBtitutioD, the srdddh. Like other Hindus the Aryaa burn the dead, 



Arya Samdj aims. 23 

but for alleged sanitary reasons they employ spices for the hurninf^. 
At first they took the q^hul to the Gant^pR, but now thoy cast it into 
the nearest stream : tliey do not call in the Acluiraj, and they omit all 
the ceremonies of the kiryaharm. At marriage thoy ^o round the 
sacred fire and walk the seven steps like the Hindus, but omit the 
worship of Ganesh. They generally employ Brahmans at wedding^s, 
but in several known instances these have been dispensed with. The 
Sami'ij finds an efficacy in prayer {prdrthana) and worship (iijxjftnd) ; 
but it greatly limits the number of ceremonies to which it accedes any 
meritorious powers. It discourages entirely the practice of bathing in 
sacred streams, pilgrimages, the u«se of beads, and sandal-wooi marks, 
gifts to worthless mendicants, and all the thousand rifos of popular 
Hinduism. Only those rites (sanskdra-t) are to bo observed which 
find authority in the Vedas, and those are IG in number only. Ido- 
latry and all its attendant ceremonies have, according to tho Aryas, no 
basis in the Vedas and no place in true religion. Ri'im, Krishna and 
other objects of popular adoration are treated euhemeristically as pious 
or powerful princes of the olden time; and in their salutation to each 
other the Arj^as substitute the word 'Namasto' for the ^ Kitm Ram' 
of the vulgar. 

Social and political aims of the Samdj. — The Aryas are careful to 
defend their religion from a charge of novelty : thoy regard it as a revival 
of an old and forgotten faith, the decay of which Avas due mainly to tho 
Brahmans. The Arya theory of to-day is that the real Brahman is one 
who is a Brahman in the heart ; tliat the Vedas are not con6ncd to one 
class ; and that all castes are equal before God. It is careful, however, to 
accept the existence of the four castes of ancient Hinduism : it retains the 
sacred thread for the three superior castes, and by implication debHrs 
the Sudras from some of tho privileges of the twice-born. In practice 
no Arya will marry with another caste or cat with men of another caste. 
The sect being almost entirely composed of educated men and being 
based on theories unfitted to the understanding of the lower castes, tho 
right of Chuhras and tho like to join its ranks has not, I understand, 
been put to the test. But the Samdj is said to have been successful in 
receiving back into Hind n ism persons converted to Christianity or 
Muhammadanism and in reinstating such persons in caste. Tlie Aryas 
do not regard the cow as a sacred animal, but follow Hindu prejudice 
in considering the slaughter of a cow more heinous than that of other 
animals : and in the anti-cow-killing movement the Samaj was to some 
extent identified with the movement, though less so in the Punjab than 
in the United Provinces. In other respects the social programme of the 
Sam/ij is liberal and anti-popular in the extreme. It sets its face 
against child-marriage and it encourages the reman'iago of widows. It 
busies itself with female education, with orphanages and schools, dis- 
pensaries and public libraries, and philanthropic institutions of all sorts. 

The Arya doctrines have been formulated in a series of ten somewhat 
wide propositions, and any person professing belief in tho funda- 
mental principles of the Samilj is elieible for membership, and may, 
after probatiorj, be admitted as a full member and obtain a vote in tho 
affairs of the society. Weekly meetings are held — generally on Sun- 
days, so asi to admit of the presence of Government servants and 



24 Arya Samdj^Aujla, 

ploaclers— ^vitli prayers, lectures on the Vodas and other subjects, 
hymns sung on the S:ima Veda system, and other miscellaneous pro- 
ceedings. At an annual meeting, a report is read and an Executive 
Committee with office-bearers appointed. Each local Samd,j is inde- 
pendent of the others : but a considerable number of the local Samdjea 
have voluntarily submitted to the ParopaHrini Sabha op Provincial 
Committee, which in a general way supervises the local centres and 
arranges for the duo provision of Upadeshaks or missionaries. The Arya 
Samtij, though paying extreme reverence to the memory of Sw^rai 
Daydnand, refuses to look on him or any one else as an infallible 
Guru ; and in the absence of any central control exercised by an 
individual, the organization above described has been very instru- 
mental in keeping the society together and preventing so far any 
serious schism in its ranks. A still more marked influence is un- 
doubtedly exercised by the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic College, which 
was founded in Lahore some time ago and has been conducted entirely 
on Aryan lines. The College, while preparing students in the ordinary 
subjects with considerable success for the university examinations, pays 
special attention to instruction in Sanskrit and Hindi, and imparts a 
certain amount of religious training by the institutions of morning and 
evening prayer in the boarding houses, and by the reading of extract3 
from the 8atydrth PraMsh." 

The above quotations show how inadequately the Arya Samdj is 
described as a sect. Since they were penned, in 1891, the Samdj has 
been divided on the question of the lawfulness or otherwise of 
animal foods and two parties have been formed, one the vegetarian 
or Mahatma, the other the flesh-eating or ' cultured.* The former is, 
however, by no means narrow in its views, for it favours female educa- 
tion. The latter holds possession of the Dayanand College and is 
thence also called the Anarkalli or College party as opposed to the 
vegetarian or City party.

This would make them akin to t'le Punnun. They are also found as

gomery they are both Hindu and Muhammadan. The Muhammadan 
Aulakh of Leiah have a curious tale. Complaint was made to Uumdyun 
that Pir Muhammad Rajan drank hhang, in defiance of the Quranic 
prohibition. So the emperor summoned the saiut to Delhi and made 
him walk along a narrow path beset with poitioned swords, while a 
ferocious elephant pursued him. But as he walked the steel turned to 
water and one of his disciples killed the elephant with a single blow of 
his staff. Among the courtiers was Rdja Aulakh, a Punwar Rdjput, 
who at once embraced Islam. The saint returned to Kdjanpur, and 
Aulakh followed him, conquered the country from the Balun tribe and 
gave it to the Pirs, on whom the emperor also conferred it in jdgir, 
though the Aulakh continued to administer it until about 175 years 
ago, when their power declined.

25 Awdn origins. 

ing along the whole length of the Range from Jhelum to the Indus, 
they art) found in great numbers throughout the whole country be- 
yond it up to tho foot, of the Sulemtlos and the Safed Koh* ; though 
in traus-Indua Bannu they partly, and in Dera Ismail Khdn wholly, 
merge in the JjUs, a term which in those pg-rts means little more 
than a nondescript peasant. In Peshdwar the Awd,ns are included 
in the hamsdya or faqir class. In Kohd,t towards Khushalgarh they 
resemble the Awaus of the Salt Range, but elsewhere in that District 
2b'c are hardly distinguishable from the Bangash and Nid,zais among 
whom they live. 

The independent possessions of the Awdns in the Salt Range 
were once very considerable, and in its western and central portion 
they are still the dominant race. As a dominant tribe the eastern 
limits of their position conicide approximately with the western 
border of the Chakwdl and Find Dddan Khdn tahsils, but they have 
also spread eastwards along the foot of the hills as far as the 
Sutlej, and southwards down that river valley into Multd^n and Jhang. 
They formerly held all the plain country at the foot of the western 
Salt Range, but have been gradually driven up into the hills by 
Pathdns advancing from the Indus, and Tiwanas from the Jhelum. 

The word Awd,u is not unplausibly derived from Ahwan, 'helper,'t 
but various explanations of its origin are given. According to one 
tradition the Awans, who claim Arab origin, are descendants of Qutb 
Shdh, himself descended from AH, and were attached to the Mu- 
hammadan armies which invaded India as ' auxiliaries,'! whence their 
name. In Kapurthald a more precise vt-rsion of their legend makes 
them Alwi Sayyids, who oppressed by the Abba^sides, sought refuge 
in Sindh ; and eventually allied themselves with Sabuktagin, who 
bestowed on them the title of Awdn. But in the best available account 
of the tribe§ the Awdns are indeed said to be of Arabian ongin and 
descendants of Qutb Shah, but he is said to have ruled Herat and 
to have joined Mahraud of Ghazni when he invaded India. With 
him came six of his many sons : Gauhar Shdh or Gorrara, who settled 
near Sakesar .• Kalan Shdh or Kalgan who settled at Dhankot 
(Kdlabdgh) : Chauhan who colonised the hills near the Indu8|| : Khokhar 
or Muhammad Shah who settled on the Chenab: ToriT[ and Jhajh 
whose descendants are said to be still found in Tirdh and elsewhere. 

* Raverty says 'Awan-kirs' held the Karwin darra in Kurram, but none appear to be 
found now in the Kurram Valley : Notes, p. 82. 

I Another tradition is that when Zuhair went forth to fight with Hasan, he left his wife, 
then pregnant, with Zain-ul-abidaia in amdn or ' trust,' whence her son's descendants are 

■ called Awan. A curious variant of this appears in Talagang where it is said that Qutb 
Shah's descendant having lost all his sons was bidden by a saint to place his next born son 
in a potter's kiln 'on trust'. He did so, and after the kiln had been burnt the child was 
taken out alive.

Cunningham's theory that Janju^s and A.w»ns were within historical times one race : (Arch. 
Survey Reports. II 17 fE ) : and of Brandreth's theory that the Awans, though recent immi- 
grants into the Punjab, are descended from Bactrian Greeks. Mr. Talbot also mentions the 
Gangs and Munds who are generally reckoned as Awans, but who are probably only 
affiliated indigenous clans,

Awdn groups. 27 

The originally Hindu character of these names is patent, and not 
explained away by the tradition that Chauhan and Khokhar took their 
mother's name. 

In Gujrdt tradition gives Qutb Shah three wives, from whom pprang 
the Khokhars and the four muhins or clans of the Awans. By Barth, 
his first wife, he had a son named Khokhar : by Sahd, he had Khurara 
or Gurara : and by Fateh Khatuu, three sous — Kalgdn, Chauh^a and 
Kundan. 

These four clans are again divided into numerous septs, often bear- 
ing eponymous namt^s, hut sometimes the names of Guiar, Jdt and 
other tribal septs appear. Thus in Si^lkot^ the Awans are said to 
be divided into 24 muhins. But in Gujr^t the Khurara clan comprises 
21 sub-divisions, including such names as Jdlap and Bhakri : the 
Kalgdn comprise 43 sub-divisions, including Dudial, Andar, Papin 
and others : the Cliauh^ns have three septs, Ludain, Bhusin and 
Ghuttar : and the Kundan Chechi. Mahr, Malha, Maydn, Puchal and 
Saroia. Few of these look like Muhammadan patronymics. 

Note. — The Awans in Kapurthala are said to have the following oots : — Kalg>in (really a 
m'lhin , Rai L'ul, Ghalli, Jand, Bagewali, Jaspal, Khokuar, Gobu or Gulistan, Harpal 
and Khor Joti. 

The A wan septs give their names to several places-names, such as 
Golera in Rjiwalpindi, Khiora (Khewra) iu Jhelum, Bajara in {Sialkot, 
Jand, etc. 

As claiming descent from Qutb Shdh the Aw^ns are often called 
Qutb-shahi, and sometimes style themselves Ulami. In Gujrdt they 
only marry inter se, refusing to give daughters even to the Chibbs, 
and not inter- marrying with the Khokhars. In Jhelum too "Awdns 
give their daughters in marriage to Awans only as a rule, though 
there seems to be some instances of marriages with leading men of the 
Chakwdl tribes : it is said, however, that the Kalabdgh Mallik refused 
to betroth his daughter to Sardar Muhammd Ali, chief of the Kdwal- 
pindi Ghebas. In some families at least, prominent Awdns not in- 
frequently take to wife women of low tribes (usually having an Awdn 
wife also), and this practice does not seem to meet with as much 
disapproval as in most other tribes of equal social standing : but 
ordinarily Awan wives alone are taken.t Certain families marry with 
certain other families only : and in all cases marriage is generally but 
not necessarily within the muhl." 

* The Customary Law of this District (Voliune XIV) p, 3, gives the following list of Awan 
8ub-clans :— 

1 BagwAl 9 Harpal 17 Mangar 

2 Bijra 10 Jalkhijh 18 Mirza

arc classed as Kalgan.

This passage is entirely consistent with the popular classification 
of the Awans as zamhiddr or yeomen, in contradistinction to the sdhu 
or gentry (Jaojuas and Ghakkars), but on a level with the Mairs and 
other leading tribes of Chakwdl. 

The loading family among the Awd,ns is that of the Malik of Kd,- 
Idbagh, and throughout the Jhelum Salt Range they have numerous 
rnaliks* notably Lfil KMn of Nurpur in Find Dadan Khdn, head 
of the Shidl (descendants of Shihd,n, a great malik in the latter 
part of the eighteenth century). 

Like the Kassai's, Janjuas and Khokhars, but unlike the Ghakkars, 
the Awdns have the institution of sirddri, whereby the eldest son 
of a chief gets an extra share. In other respects their customs of 
inheritance are closely alike those of the other Muhammadau tribes 
among whom they live. In Shd-hpur and Jhelum, however, the 
Awdns recognize a daughter's right to succeed. 

In the Awdn villages nf Talagang tahsil all the graves have a 
vertical slab at either end, while a woman's grave can be at once 
distinguished by a smaller slab in the centre. t 

An Awdn girl plaits her hair on the forehead and wears only 
ear-drops, this style being given up after marriage. J Betrothal is 
effected by the girl's father sending a bard or barber to the boy's 
home with a few rupees and some sweets : or no ceremony at all 
is observed. ,

Bab —A Muhammadan J^t clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery and 

Baba Lal Daryai, a sect, followers of a addhu whose ehrino is on the Chenib 
in the Wazirabdd tahsil of Gujrdnwdld- and who miraculously turned 
water into food. 

Baba Lku, a follower of one of several Bab^ Lal^. B^ba Ldl Tahliwdld was 
a Bairdgi of Find Dddan Khdn who could turn dry sticks into fihisham 
[tahli] treea. An(,ther Biiba Ldl had a famous coutroversy with D^rd 
Shikoh * Another Bdb^ Ldl had his headquarters at Bhera, and yet 
another has a shrine in Gurddspur. 

Babak. — A small tribe allied to the Sherdnis — indeed said to be descended 
from a son of Dom, a grnnd<on of Sherai-ai. They are divided i'lto 
two main branches, Maiisand and Ghor* Khel. The former are sub- 
divided into four and the latter into eiglit sul)-di visions. 

The Babavs are a civilised tribt^ and most of them can read and 
write. t They are devoted to commerce and are the wealthiest, quietest 
and most honest tribe of the sub-Sulaim^ti plains. Edwardes called 
them the most superior race in the whole of the trans-Indus districts, 
and the proverb says : ' A Bdbar fool is a (randapur sage.' Intensely- 
democratic, they have never had a recognised chief, and the tribe is 
indeed a scattered one, many residingr in Kandahar and other parts of 
Khor:isdn as traders. A few are still engaged in the powinda traffic. 
The B^bars appear to have occupied their present seats early in the 
]4tb century, driving out the Jiits and Baloch (?) population from the 
plnins and then being pushed northward, by the UshtHrnni proner. 
Their centre is Chaudwan and their outlying villages are held by Jdt 
and Baloch tenants, as they cultivate little themselves.

or aboriginal — and in Bahd-walpur, where they give the following

its eponym and his descendant Kura Pal whose sons settled in Si^lkot

Badee, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Badgdjar, Bar-, a class (or possibly rank) found among the Brahmans, 
Rajputs, Meos and possibly other tribes, as well as often along with 
Gujars. Thus the Bargujar Rd-jputs about Bhundsi in Gurgd,on border 
on villao-es held by Gujars, and in one village there Gujars hold most of 
the village and Bargujar Rd,jputs the rest. Similarly in Bd,sdalla near 
Punah^na in Gurgdon Meos hold most of the village and Gujars the 
rest. (Sir J. Wilson, K.CS.I., in P. N. Q. I., § 130). But according 
to Ibbetson, the Bargujar are one of the b6 royal Rd,jput famihes, and 
the only one except the Gahlot which claims descent from Ldwa, son 
of H&m Chandra. Their connection with the Mandahd,r is noticed 
under Mandah^r. They are of course of Solar race. Their old capital 
was R^jor, the ruins of which are still to be seen in the south of Alwar, 
and they held much of Alwar and the neighbouring parts of Jaipur till 
dipossessed by the Kachwdha. Their head-quarters are now at 
Anupshahr on the Ganges, but there is still a colony of them in 
Gurgd,on on the Alwar border. Curiously enough, the Gurg^on 
Bargujar say that they came from Jullundur about the middle of the 
15th century ; and it is certain that they are not very old holders of 
their present capital of Sohna, as the buildings of the Kambohs who 
held it before them are still to be seen there and are of comparatively 
recent date. 

Badhan or Pakhai, a tribe of Jdts, claiming Saroa Rd,jput origin and 
descended from an eponym through Kala, a resident of Jammu. 
Found in Sidlkot.

in the south of that District, but are also found in some numbers under 
the heading of Jat in Sialkot and Patidla. In Gurdaspur the Bagri 
are Salahria who describe themselves as Bdgar or Bhagar by claii 
and probably have no connection with the Bagri of Hisskr and its

Bahniwaf,, a Jdt tribe, found cViipfly in His?ar and Patidla. They are also 
fourd on the lower Sutlej in Montfjomery, where in 1S81 thpy probably 
returned th('ms<4ves as Bhatfci Rajputs, which they claim to be by de- 
scent. Ill His-iir tliey appear to \>e a B-Agri tvve, though they claim to 
be Deswali, and to have been Chauhans of Sambhar in Haj'mtana whence 
they spread into Hikdner and Siisa. Mr. Purser says of them:— "In 
numbers they are weak; but, in love of robbery they yield to none of 
the tribes." They gave much trouble in 1857. In t)>e 15th century 
the Bahniwal held one of the six cantons into which Bikciner was then 
divided.

Baheiipia. — Bahrupia is in its origin a purely " occupational term derived 
from the Sanskrit hahu ^ many ' a,nd riipa 'form/ and denotes an 
actor, a mimic, one who assumes many forms or characters, or engages 
in many occupations. One of the favourite devices of the Bahrupias 
is to ask for money, and when it is refused, to ask that it may be- 
given on condition of the t3ahrupia succeeding in deceiving the 
person who refuses it. Some days later the Bahrupia will again visit 
the house in the disguise of a pedlar, a milkman, or what not, sell 
his goods without beiui? detected, throw off his disguise, and claim the 
stipulated reward. They may be drawn from any caste, and in 
Rohtak there are Chuhra Bahrupias. But in some districts a family 
or colony of Bahrupias has obtained land and settled down on it, and 
so become a caste as much as any other. Thus there is a Bahrupia 
family in Pd,n]pat which holds a village revenue- free, though it now 
professes to be Shaikh. In Sialkot and Gujrd-t Mahtams are commonly 
known as Bahrupias. In the latter District the Bahrupias claim con- 
nection with the Rajas of Chittaur and say they accompanied Akbar in 
an expedition against the Pathans. After that they settled down to 
cultivation* on the banks of the Chenab. They have four clans — 
Rathaur, Chauhdn, Punwar and Sapawat— which are said not to in- 
termarry. All are Sikhs in this District. Elsewhere tht-y are Hindus or 
Muhammadans, actors, mountebanks and sometimes cheats. The 
Bahrupias of Gurd^spur are said to work in cane and bamboo. 
The Bahrupia is distinct from the Bhand, and the Bahrupia villages 
on the Sutlej in Phillaur tahsil have no connection with the Mahtons 
of Hosbiarpur.t Bahrupias are often found in wandering gangs. 

Bahti, a term used in the eastern, as Chang is used in the western, portion 
of the lower ranges of the Kd,ngra Hills and Hoshiarpur as equivalent 
to OJiirtli. All of them intermarry. 

Bahti, hill men of fairly good caste, who cultivate and own land largely; 
and also work as labourers. They are said to be degraded R^ijputs. 
In Hoshiarpur (except Dasuya) and Jullundur they are called Bahti; 
in Dasuya and Nurpur Chang ; in Kd,ngra Ghirth; all intermarry freely. 
In the census of 1881 all three were classed as Bd,hti. The Chang are 
also said to be a low caste of labourers in the hills who also ply as 
muleteers. 

* As cultivators they are thrifty and ambitious. They also make baskets, ropes aud 
tope-nets — travggars, and chikkaS in Gujrat.

Baid — Bairdgi. 35 

Baid, a got of the Oswal Bhnbri'is, Mulii;'il Bralunans and other castes : also 
a physician, a term applied o-eneraly to all who practise Vedic me- 
dicine. 

Baidwan,* an important Hindu-Sikh Jat tribo in Ambala. 

Bains, a J;U tribe, whose h^ad- quarters appear to be in Uoshidrpurf and 
Jullundur, thougli they have spread west^vards oven as far as Riiwal- 
pindi, and eastwards into Anibrila and the adjoining Native Statfs. 
'I'hey say that they are by origin Janjua lliijputs, and that their ances- 
tor Bains came eastwards in the time of Firoz Shiib. Bains is one of 
the 36 royal families of Hajputs, but Tt^d believes that; it is merely a 
sab-division of the Suryabansi section. They give their name to Bais- 
wara, or the easternmost portion of the Ganges-Jamna dodh. The 
Sardars of AUlwalpur in Jullundur are Bains, whose ancestor came 
from Hoshidrpur to Jalla near Sirhind in Nabha some twelve genera- 
tions ago. 

The Bairagi. 

Bairaqi. — The Bairdgi (Vairagi, more correctly, from Sanskr. vairdgya, 
' devoid of passion,') is a devotee of Vi<' nu. The Bainigis probably 
represent a very old element in Indian religion, for those of the sect 
who wear a leopard-skin doubtless do so as personating Nar Singh, 
the leopard incarnation of Vishnu, lust a? the Bhagauti faqir imitates 
the dress,J dance, etc., of Ki-ishna. Tlie priest who personates the 
god whom he worships is found in 'almost every rude religion : while 
in later cults the old rite survives at least in the religious use of animal 
masks,'§ a practice still to be found in Tibet. There is, moreover, an 
undoubted pun on the word Ihrdg, * leopard ', and Bairdyi, and this 
possibly acfount'^ for the wearing of the leopaid skin. The feminine 
form of Bairagi, hairdgan, U the term af^plied to the ^aif-shaped crutch 
on which a devotee leans either sitting or standnig, to tbe small 
enblematic crutch about a foot long, and to the crutch hilt of a sword 
or dagger. In Jiud tlie Bairdgi is said to be also called Shdmi. 

The orders devoted to the cults of Rdm i.nd Krishn are known 
generically as Bairdgis, and th^ir history commences with Rdmdnuja, 
who taught in Southern India in the ll-12tli centuries, and from his 
name tlie designation Ramdmiji may be derived. || But it is not until 
the time of Rdmanand, i.e., until the end of the 1 4th century, that the 
sect rose to power or importance in Northern India. 

The Bairdgis are divided into four main orders {f^ampardas^ , viz., 
Rdmdnandi, Vishnuswdmi, Nimdnandi and Mddliavachdri. 

* FrtDcifnlly derived from baid, a pbysiciftn — who rescued a bride of the clan from 
robbers and was rewarded l)y their adoptinpf his njirne. 

t The Bains hold a bdrah or pronp of 12 (iictuaily 15 or 10) villages near Mahilpur in 
this Distri'^t. 

t Tnimpp's Adi-Granth. p. 98. 

§ Robertson Smith : Religion of the Semites, p. 437. 

II See Ibbetson, § 521 : vphere the llamanxijis are said to worship Mahndeo nnd thus ap- 
pear to b-i Shaivas. Further the Bair^gis arc there said to have been founded by Sri 
Anand, the 12th disciple of Ranuinand. The termination ?i a h J t appears to be connected 
with his name. 

It is only to the followers of Raminand or his contemporaries that the term Bairagfis 
properly applied. 



8(J The Bairdgi caste. 

Of these the first-named contains six of the 52 dwdrds* (schools) of 
these Bairdgi orders, viz., the Anbhimandi, Dundaram, Agarji, Telaji, 
Kubhdji, and Ramsaluji. 

In the Punjab only two of the four sampardds are usually found. 
These are (i) the Kdmdnandis, who hke the Vishnuswdmis are devotees 
of Rdmchandr, and accordingly celebrate his birthday, the Rdmnaumi,t 
study the Rdmayand and make pilgrimages to Ajudhid : their insignia 
being the tar pundri or trident, marked on the forehead in white, with 
the central prong in red or white. 

The only other group found in the Punjab is (m) the Nimanandi, who, 
like the Mddhavachdris, are devotees of Krishna. They too celebrate 
the 8th of Bhddon as the date of Krishna's incarnation, but they study 
the Sri Madh Bhagwat and the Gita, and regard Bindraban, Mathra 
and Dwarkdndth as sacred places. On their foreheads they wear a two-' 
pronged fork, J all in white. 

In the Punjab proper, however, even the distinction between Rama 
and Nimd-nandi is of no importance, and probably hardly known. In 
parts of the country the Bairdgis form a veritable caste being allowed 
to marry, and [e.g.] in Sirsa they are hardly to be distinguished from 
ordinary peasants, while in Karnal many (excluding the sddkus or 
monks of the monasteries, asthal, whose property descends to their 
spiritual children§) marry and their hindu or natural children succeed 
thetn.ll This latter class is mainly recruited from the Jdts, but the 
caste is also recruited fromi the three twice-born castes, the disciple 
being received into his guru's sampardd and dwdra.*^ In some tracts, 
e. ^ , in Jind, the Bairdgis are mostly secular. They avoid in marriage 
their own samjjar da and their mother's dwdra. In theory any Bairdgi 
may take fond from any other Bairdgi, but in practice a Brahman 
Bairdgi will only eat from the hands of another Brahman, and it is 
only at the ghosti or place of religious assembly that recruits of all 
castes can eat together. The restrictions regarding food and drink are 
however lax throughout the order. Though the Bairdgis, as a rule, 
abstain frorn flesh and spirits, the secular members of the caste certainly 
do not. In the southern Punjab the Bairdgi is often addicted to bhang 

To return to the Bairdgis as an order, it would appear that as a 
body they keep the jata or long hair, wear coarse loin-cloths and 
usually affect the suffix Das. As opposed to the Sanidsis, or Ldl-pddris, 
they style themselves Sitd-padris, as worshippers of Sita Rdm. 

*Itmay be conjectured that the Va'abhacharis, Biganandis, and Ni'mi-Kharak-swamfs are 
three of these fh/'dra'« : or the latter term may be equivalent to Nimanandi. Possibly the 
SIta-padris are really a modern dwdra The Kadha-balabhi, who affect Krishna's wife 
Badha, can hardly be anything but a divdra. 

fTheinh of Bhadon. 

X Its shape is siiid to be derived from the figure of the Nar Singh (man-lion) incarnation 
which tore PraVdad t) pieces. 

§ Called nadi, is contradistinction to hivdu children. Celibate Bairagfs are called Nagas, 
the secular ghar-bd-i or i^/iir/sfi, i.e. , householders. 

II It is not clear how property descends, e o., it is said that if a .g-urii marry his property 
descends on his death to his disciples, in Jind (just as it, does in Karnal^. But apparently 
property inherited from the natural family devolves on the natural children, while that in- 
herited from the quni descends to the chela. In the Kaithal tahsil of Karnal the agricultural 
Bairai^is who own the village of Dig are purely secular, 

1[ But men of any caste may become Bairagis and the order appears, as a rule, to be re- 
cruited from the lower castes.

Bairdgi developments. 87 

As regards his tenets a Bairdgi is pometimes said to be subject to 
five rules : — (i) ho must journey to Dwarka and there be branded witli 
iron on the right arm :* {ii) he must mark his forehead, as already 
describefl, with the gojn chandan clay : [Hi) he must invoke one of the 
incarnations of Krishna: {iv) he must wear a rosary of /mZsi : and (t) 
he should know and repeat some mantra relating to one of Vishnu's 
incarnations. Probably these tenets vary in details, though not in 
principle, for each samparda, and possibly for each dwdra also. 

The monastic communities of the Bairagis are powerful and ex- 
ceedingly well conducted, often very wealthy, and exercise much 
hospitality. They are numerous in Hoshiarpur. Some of their mahants 
are well educated and even learned men, and a few possess a knowledge 
of Sanskrit. 

Baibagi developments. 
The intense vitality of the Bairagi teachings maybe gauged from the 
number of sub-sects tn which they havf given birth. Among these may 
be noted the Hari-Dclsis (in Rohtak), the Kesho-panthfst (in Mult4n) 
the Tulsi-Dasis, Gujr^nwala, the Murdr-panthisl, the Babd-L^lis. 

The connection of the earliest form of Sikhism with the Bair<4gi 
doctrines is obscure, but it is clear that it was a close one. Kalladhilri 
the ancestor of the Bedi family of Una, was also the predecessor of 
the Brahman Kalladhari maliants of Dharmsal in the Una tahsil, who 
are Bairdgis, as well as followers of Ndnak, whence they are called 
Vaishav-Nanak-panthi. This community was founded by one Nakodar 
Dds who in his youth was absorbed in the deity while lying in the 
shade of a banyan tree instead of tending his cattle, and at last 
after a prolonged period of adoration, disappeared into the unknown. 
Another Baitdgi, Kdm Thamman, was a cousin of Nanak and is some- 
times claimed as his follower. His tank near Lahore is the seetie of a 
fair, held at the Baisiiklii, and formerly notorious for disturbances 
and, it is said, immoralities. It is still a great meeting point for 
Bairagi ascetics. Further it will not be forgotten that Banda, the 
successor of the Sikli gurus, was, originally, a Bair^i, while two 
Bairagi sub-sects (the Sarnddsi and Simrandflsi§) arc sometimes classed 
as Udd,sis. 

A modern offshoot of the Bairdgis are the Charand^sis, founded by 
one Charan Das who was born at Dehra in Alwar State in 1703.|| His 
father was a Dhusar who died when his so-j, then named Kanjit Singh, 
was only 5. Brought up by relations at Delhi the boy became a 

* These brands include the conch shell (s/ianfc),discu<' or fhfli-fcar, club or gada, and lotus. 
Besides the iron brands (f apt wia/)«, lit. fire-marks) watermarks (si'aZ juwdra, lit. cold-* 
marks) are also used. Further the initiatory rite, though often performed at Dwarkk, may 
be performed anywhere especially in the guru''si house. Some B..iragis even brand their 
women's arms before they will eat or drink anything touched by ihem. 

t t'robally worshippers of :i Inoal s.iinl or of Krishna himself. 

j Possibly followers of a Biba Murar whose shrine is in Lahore District, or worshippers 
of Krishn Mur4ri, i.e., the enemy of Mur, a demon. 

§ Sometimes said to be one and the same. Simran D4s was a Brahman, who lived two 
centuries ago, and his followers are Gosains who wear the tuhi necklace and worship their 
gurus bed. 

II Another account says he became Sukhdeo's disciple at the age of 10 in Sbt. 1708, 
1651 A. D. For a full account of the sect see Wilson's quoted in Maclagan's, Punjab Census 
Report, 1891, p. 121. 



38 Bdirdgi'—Bajwd. 

disciplo of Sulchdeo Dds, himself a spiritual descendant of Bi^sji, in 
Muzaffarna^ar, and assumed the name of Charan D^s. He taught 
the unity of God, preached abolition of caste and inculcated purity of 
life. His three principal disciples, Swdmi Ram-rup, Jagtan Gos^in 
and a woman named »Shahgoleai encli founded a monastery in Delhi, 
in which city there is also a temple dedicated to Charan D^s where the 
impression of his foot [cliaran) is worshipped.* His initiates are celibate 
and worship Krishna and his favourite queen Radha above all gods and 
goddesses. Tliey wear on the forehead the joti sao'up ov ''body of 
flame," which consists of a single perpendicular line of white ;t and 
dress in saffron clothes with a tulsi necklace. The chief scripture 
of the sect is the Bhagat-sdgar, and the 1 1th day of each fortnight is 
kept as a fast. Charan Dds is believed to have displayed miracles 
before Nddir Shd,h, on his conquest of Delhi, and however that may be, 
his disciples obtained grants of land from the Mughal emperors which 
they still hold. 
Bairwal, a tribe of Jats who claim to be descendants of Birkhman, a 
Chauh^n Rdjput, whose son married a Jat girl as his second wife and 
so lost status. The name is eponymous, and they are found in the 
Bdwal Niz^mat of N^bha. 

Baistola, a Jain sect : see Jain. 

Baizai, one of the two clans of the Akozai Yusafzai. It originally held 
the Lundkhwar valley, in the centre of the northernmost part of 
Peshawar, and all the eastern hill country between that and the Swdt 
river. It still hoLis the hills, but the Khattak now hold all the west of 
the valley and the Utm^n Khel its north-east corner, so that the Baizai 
only hold a small tract to the south of these last. Their six 
septs are the Abba and Aziz Khels, the B^bozai, Matorezai, Musa 
and Zangi Khels. The last lies south of the Ham range which 
divides Sw^t from Buner. Only the three first-named hold land in 
British territory. 

Bajar, a Gujar clan (agricultural} found in Amritsar.

Jdts. 

Bajwa, a Jdit clan (agricultural) found in Sid^lkot, Amritsar and Multdn, and 
as a Hindu Jdt clan in Montgomery. The B^jwa Jats are of the same 
kin as the Bajju Rajputs. J In Sialkot they have the customs of rasoa

Bajwd — BaTchtiar. 3 9 

Shalip was driven out of Multan in the time of Sikandar Lodi. His 
two sons Kals and Lis escaped in the disiJruiso of falconers. Lis went 
to jHramii and there married a Katil Rajput brido, while K^ls married 
a J at girl in Pasriir. TIih descendants of both live in the Bajwiit, but 
are said to be distinguished as Bajju Kajputs and Bajwa Jats. 
Another story has it that their ancestor Jas or Hai Jaisan was driven 
from Delhi by Rai Pitora and settled at Karbala in Si^ikot. Yet 
another tale is tliat Naru, Rdjii of Jamrau, gave him 84 villages in 
ilaqa Ghol for killing Mir Jagwa., a mighty Pathfm. The Bajju 
Rdjputs admit their relationship with the Bajwa Jt^s. Kals had a 
son, Dawa, whose son Dewa had three sons, Muda, Wasr, and Nana 
surnamed Chachrah. Nana'a children having all died, he was told by 
an astrologer that only those born under a chachri tree would live. 
His advice was taken and Nana's next son founded the Chachrah sept, 
chiefly found near Narowdl. The Bajju Rfijputs have the custom 
of chundai-and and are said to marry their daughters to Chibli , 
Bhau and Manhds Riijputs, and their eons to Rajputs. 'i'ht» Bajju 
Rdjputs are said to have had till quite lately a custom by which a 
Mussalman girl could be turned into a Hindu for purposes o£ 
marriage, by temporarily burying her in an underground chamber and 
ploughing the earth over her head. In the betrothals of this tribe 
dates aroused, a custom perhaps brought with them from Multan, and 
they have several other singular customs resembling those of the Sahi 
Jats. They are almost confined to Sidlkot, though they have spread 
in small numbers eastwards as far as Patiala. 

Bakarki, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

Bakhar, a Rdjput clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

BakkhaRj an agricultural clan found in Shahpur. 

Bakhri, a clan found in the Shahr Farid ilaqa of Bahawalpur. They claim 
to be Sumrds by origin, and have Charan bards, which points to a 
Rajput origin. They migrated from Bhakhkhar to Multdn, where 
they were converted to Islam by Gaus Baha-ud-Din Zakaria, and 
fearing to return to their Hindu kinsmen settled down in Multan 
as weavers. Thence they migrated to JSurpur, Pakpattan and other 
places, and Farld Khdn I settled some of thom in Shalir Farid from 
Nurpur. They make lungis. (The correct form is probably Bhakhri). 

Bakhshial, a family of Wahora Khatris, settled at Bhdun ia Jhelum, which 
has a tradition of military service. 

Bakhtiar, a small Pathan tribe of Persian origin who are associated with the 
Mian Khel Pathans of Dera Ismail Khan, and now form one of their 
principal sections. 

Raverty however disputes this, and ascribes to the Bakhtiars a 
Sayyid origin. Shiran, the eponym of the ShiraAii Pathdns, gave a -?^ -J* 
daughter to a Sayyid Ishaq whose son by her was named Habib the 
Abu-Sa'id, or 'Fortunate' (Bakhtyar). This son was adopted by his 
step-father Midnai, son of Dom, a son of Shirdz. The Bakhtiars have 
produced several saints, among them the Makhdiim-i-'Alam, Khwdja 
Yahya-i-Kabir, son of Khwaja llias, son of Sayyid Muhammad, and a 
contemporary of Sultan Muhammad Tugbluq Shah. Ho died in

1333 A. D., and his descendants are called Shaikhzais. Raverty says 
the Persian Bakhtiaris* are quite distinct from the Bakhti^rs. 
Bakhtmal sddhs, a Sikh sect founded by one Bakhtmal. When Guru Govind 
Singh destroyed the masands or tax-gatherers one of them, by name 
Bakhtmal, took refuoc with Mat^, a Gujar woman who disguised him 
in woman's clothes, putting bangles on hia wrists and a nath or nose- 
ring in his nose. This attire ho adopted permanently and the mahant 
of his gaddi still wears bangles. His followers are said to be also 
called Bakhshish sddhs, but this is open to doubt. The head-quarters 
of the sect appears to be unknown. 

Bal, a Jat tribe of the Bids and Upper Sutlej, said to be a clan of the 
Sekhu tribe with whom they do not intermarry. Their ancestor is also 
said to have been named Baya Bal, a Rajput who came from 
Malwa. The name Ba.1, which means " strength," is a famous one in 
ancient Indian history, and recurs in all sorts of forms and places. 
In Amritsar they say they came from Ballamgarh, and do not inter- 
marry with the Dhillon. 

Bal, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Balagan, a tribe of Jats, claiming to be Jammu Rajputs by descent from 
their eponym. Found in Sidlkot. 

Balahab, in Gurgaon the haldhar (in Sirsa he is called daurd,) is a village 
menial who shows travellers the way, carries messages and letters, and 
summons people when wanted by the headmen. In Karnd^l he iv, called 
lehhar\ ; but is not a recognised menial and any one can perform his 
duties on occasion. In Sirsa, Gurgaon and Karnal he is almost always 
a Chuhra, cf. Batwdl. 

Balahi, Balai, (/. haldhar. — In Delhi and Hissar a chaukiddr or watchman : 
in Sirsa a Cham^r employed to manure fields, or who takes to syce's 
and general work, is so termed. 

Balbie, a sept of Kanets which migrated from Chittor in R^jputdna 
with the founders of Keonthal and settled in the latter State. The 
founders of Keonthal were also accompanied by a Chaik, a Saldthiand 
a Pakrot, all Brahmans, a Chhibar Kanet, a blacksmith and a turi 
and the descendants of all these are still settled in the State or in its 
employ. 

Balfaeosh, a synonym for Bhdt (Rawalpindi). 

Balham, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Bali, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

Bali, a section of the Muhials (Brahmans) : corr. to the Dhannapotras of 
the South-West Punjab. 

Balka, an agricultural clan found inSh^hpur: balkd in the east of the 
Punjab is used as equivalent to chela, for ' the disciple of afaqlr.' 



* There is said to be a sept of the Baloch of this name in Bah£walpur and l^uzaffargarhi 
on both sides of the Panjnad. 

f Or rehhar, probably from rdhbar, ' guide.' In Karnal is no Balahar caste, the 
term being applied to a sweeper who does this particular kind of coiv6e— which no one bufc 
a sweeper (or in default a Dh^nank) will perform. 



Bdlmiki-^Baloch. 41 

Balmiki, Valmiki. — The sect of tlie Chuhras, synonymous with B^ldshfihi 
andLalbet^i, so called from Balraik, Baliikh or Bald Shah, possibly the 
same as the author of the Rdmdyana* Biilmik, the poet, was a man 
of low extraction, hnd legend represents liim as a low-caste hunter 
of the Ndrd;ik in Karnal, or a 13hil highway-man converted by a 
saint whom he was al>out to rob. One It-gen I makes him a swt-eper 
in the heavenly courts, another sis living in austerity at Ghazni.

BALOCH. Meaning of Baloch. 

The teim Baloch is used in several diffe ent wavs. By travellers 
and historians ir is employed to denote (i) the race known to them-elves 
and rheir neighbours as the Baloch, and [ii] in an extended St-nse as 
incluHini]^ all the thcos inhabiting the preat geographical area shown on 
our toMps as Biilichistan. In the lattersense it comprises the Brahui'^, 
a tribo which is certainly not of Bah ch origin. In the former sense it 
includes allrhe Baloch tiibe>^, whether fonnd in Persia on the west or 
the Puniab on the east, which can claim a de-icent, more or less pure, 
from Buloch ancestors. Two special uses of the t<-rm also require 
notice. In the great jungles below Thdu'^sai- in the Karnal district is 
settled a criminal tribe, almost certainly of Baloch extraction, which 
will be noticed below page 55.t Secondly, throughout the Punjab, 
except in the extreme west and the extreme east, the term Baloch 
denotes any Muhammadan caniel-nian. Throughout the upper grazing 
grounds of the Western Plains the Baloch settlors have taken to the graz- 
ing and breeding of camels rather than to husbandry; and thus the 
word Baloch has become associated with the care of camels, insomuch 
that in the greater part of the Punjab, the word Baloch is used for any 
Mu.-«almdn cauiel-man whatever be his caste, every Baloch being supposed 
to be a cacnel-man and every Muhammadan camel-man to be a Baloch, 

OiaoiNs OF THE Baloch 
Pnttinger and Khanikoff claimed for the Baloch race a TurkoTnan 
origin, and Sir T. Holdich and others an Arab descent. Bellew 
assigned them Rajput descent on very infidequate philological grounds, 
while Burton, Lassen and others have mainramed that they are, at 
least in the mass, of Iranian race. This last theory is supported by 
Mr. Longworth IJames who shows that the Baloch came into the r 
present locations in Mekran and on the Indian border from parts jr 
the Iranian plateau fui'ther to the west and north, bringing with them 
a language of the Old Persian stock, with many features derived from 
the Zend or Old Bactrian rather than the Western Persian. 

History of the Baloch. 

Dames assigns the first mention of the Bnloch in history 
to the Ara*<ic chronicles of the 10th century A. D., but Firdausi 
(c. 400 A.H.) refers to a still earlier period, and in his Shah-nnmaX the 
Baloches are described as forming part of the armies of Kai Kaus 

* Temple (in Legends of the Punjab, I, p. 529) acceptR this trarlition and says Balmikl 
is the samo BB Bala Shah or Niiri ^hah B^la, but aseigns to him 'the place n<>zt to 
Li\ Bep.' 

t This group is also found in Ambala, and the Giloi Baloch of Lyallpur are also said to bo 
an offshoot of it. 

X So Dames, but the text of the Shdh-ndma is very corrupt, and the reading Khoch "crest " 
cannot be relied upon implicit^. 



42 Baloch history. 

and Kai Khnsrao. The poem says tbat the army of Ashkash was 
from the wanderers of the Koch and Baloch, intent on war, with 
exalted coekscotnb creBts, whose back none in the world ever saw. 
Under NaushlrwSn, the Uliosroes who fought against Justinian, the 
Baloch are agaiu mentioned as mountaineers who raided his kingdom 
and had to be exterminated, though later on we find them serving m 
Nausbirw^n's own army. In these passages their association with the 
men of Gil and Dailarn (the peoples of Gildn and Adharbaijan) would 
appear to locate the Baloch in a province north of Karman towards the 
Caspian Sea. 

However this may be, the commencement of the 4th century of the 
Hijra and of the 10th A.D. finds the Balus or Baloch established in 
Karmiin, with, if Masndi can be trusted, the Qufs (Koch) and the 
Zutt (Jatts). The Baloch are then described as holding the desert 
plains south of the mountains and towards Makrdn and the sea, but 
they appear in reality to have infested the desert now known as the 
Lut, which lies north and east of Karmd-n and separates it from 
Khorasan and iSistan. Thence they crossed the desert into the two 
last-named provinces, and two districts of Sistan were in Istakhri's time 
known as Baloch country.^ Baloch raiders plundered Mahmud of 
Ghaznfs ambassador between Tabbas and Kbabis, and in revenge his 
son Masud defeated them at the latter place, which lies at the foot of 
the Karmdn Mountains on the edge of the desert. 

About thi-i time Firdausi wiot^^ and soon after it the Baloch must 
hnvH migrnted bodily from Karmdn into Mekran and the Sindh 
frontier, after a partial ai^d temporary halt in Sistan. With great 
prnbability Dames conjectures that at this period two movements of the 
Baloch took place : the fir;t, corresponding with the Saljuq invasion 
and the overthrow of the Dailami and Ghaznawi power in Persia, 
being their abandonment of Karm^n and settlement in Sistan and 
Western Makran ; while the second, towards Eastern Makran and the 
Sindh border, was contemporaneous with Changiz Kh6n's invasion and 
the wanderings of JaUl-ud-Din in Makran. 

To this second movement the Baloch owed their opportunity of 
invading the Indus valley; and thence, in their third and last 
migration, a great portion of the race was precipitated into the Punjab 
plains. 

It is now possible to connect the traditional history of the Baloch 
themselves, as told in their ancient heroic ballads, with the above 
account. Like other Muhamraadan races, the Baloch claim Arabian 
extraction, asserting tbat they are descended from Mir Hamza, an 
uncle of the Prophet, and from a fairy (pari). They consistently 
place their fir>t seitletnent in Hulab (Alejipo], where they remained 
until, siding with the sons of AH and taking part in the battle of 
KarbaU, they were expelled by Yazid, the second of the Omayyad 
Cahphs, in 680 A.D. Thence they fl^d, first to Karm^n, and eventually 



* Their settlements may indeed have extended into Khorasan. Even at the present day 
there is a considerable Baloch population as far north as Turbat-i-Haidari (Curzon's 
Persia, 1892, i, p. 203), ^

to Sist^n where they wore hospitably received by Shams-ud-Din,* 
ruler of that country. His successor, Badr-ud-Dfn, demandef^, according 
to eastern usage, a bride from eacli of the 4 i bolaks or clans of the 
Baloch. But the Baloch race had never yet paid tribute in this form 
to any ruler, and they sent therefore 44 bovs dressed in girls' clothes 
and fled before the deception conli be discovered. Badr-ud-Din sent 
the boys back but pursued the Baloch, who had fled houth-eastwards, 
into Kech-Makrdu wheie he wa^ defeated at their haa'is. 

At this period Mir Jaldl Khd,n, son of Jiand, was ruler of all the 
Baloch. He left four sons, Rind, Lfiyhdr, Hot and Kor^i from whom 
are descended the Rind, Lashari, Hot and Korai tribes ; and a son-in- 
law, IVlurad, from whom are descended the Jatoif or children of Jato, 
Ja]i\ Khiin'a daughter. Unfortunately, however, certain tribes 
cannot be brought into any of these five, and in order to provide 
them with ancestors two more sons, All and Bulo, ancestor of the 
Bulod/ii, have had to be found for Jalal Khdn. From All's two sons, 
Ghazan and Umar, are descended the Ghazani Harris and the 
scattered Dmrdnis. 

Traciition av^rs that Jalal Kh^n had appointed Kind to the phdjh 
or turban of chiefsliip, bur that Hot retused to join him in ere iti'ig 
the dsri'kh or memorial cunopy totdeir father. ' Thereupon each p'^r- 
formed that ceremony separately and tiiu-* tl-ere were five dsrokhs 
in Kech.' But it is far more probable that five principal gatherings 
of clans were formed under well-known leaders, each of which became 
known by some nickname or epithet, such as rind " cheat," hot, 
"warrior," Lashdri, " men ot Ldshar" and, later, Bulei/ii, " men of 
Boleda." To these other clans became in the course of time affiliated. 

A typical example of an affiliated clan is afforded by the Doddf, a 
clan of Jdt race whose origin is thus described : — 

DoddJ Surara, expelled from Thatha by his brethren, escaped by 
swimming his mare across the Indus, and, half frozen, reached the 
hut of Sdlhe, a Rind. To revive him Sdlhe placed him under the 
blankets with his daughter Mua/io, whom he eventually married. 
" For the woman's sake," says the proverb, " the man became a Baloch 
who had been a Jatt, a Jaghdal, a nobody; he dwelt at Harrand 
under the hills, and fate made him chief of all." Tims Dodd; founded 
the preat Dodai tribe of the Baloch, and Gorish, his son, founded 
the Gort«hd.m or Gurchdni, now the principal tribe of Dodai oriij;in. 
The great Mirrd,ni tribe, which for 200 years gave chiefs to Dera 
Ghazi Khdn, was also of Doddi origin. 



* According to Dames there was a Shams-iid-Din, independent malik of Sistan. who 
claimed descent from the Saffaris of Persia and who died in 1104 A.D. ;559 H.) or nearly 
500 years after the Baloch migration from Aleppo. Badr-ud-Uin appears to be unknown 
to history. 

t It is suggested that Jatoi or ' husband of a Jat woman,' just as hahnoi means ' husband 
of a sister,' although in Jatoi the t is soft. 

X "Doda, a common name among the Sumr^s whose dynasty ruled Sindh until it wa» 
overthrown by the Sammas. About 1250 A.D. or before that year we find Baloch advt-nturert 
first allied with the Sodh(is and Jharejap, and then supporting Doda IV, Sumra. Under 
Umar, his successor, the Baloches are found combining with the Sammas, Sodhss and 
Jatts, (Jharejas), but were eventually forced back to the hills without effecting any perma- 
nent lodgment in the plains. 



44 Baloch history. 

Affer thfl overthrow of the Sumr^s of Sindh notliin^ is heard of 
the Baloch for 150 yeai-s and then in the reiofn of Jam Tutrhlaq, the 
Sarnmd (142:3 — 50), tliey are rei^orded as raiding near BhaUliar in 
Sii'dh. D'Mibtless, as Drttnes holds, Taimur's inva'^ion of 1399 led 
indirectly to this new movement. The Delhi empire was at its weakest 
and Triiiniir's descendants claimed a vague suzereignty over it. Prob- 
ably all the Western Punjab was effectively held by Mughal in- 
tendants until the Lodi dynapty was established in 1451. Meanwhile 
the Langah Hd-jputs had established themselves on the throne of Multan 
and iShah Husain Langah (14d9 — J 502) called in Baloch mercenaries, 
granting a j'igir, which extended from Kot Karor to Dhankot, to 
Malik Sohrab Dod^i who came to Multan with his sons, Ghazi Khan, 
Fath Khan and Ismd^ii Kh^n.* 

But the Dodd,i were, not the only mercenaries of the Langdhs. 
Shdh Hussain had conferred the jagirs of Uch and Shor(kot) on two 
Sammd brothers, Jd,m Bayazid and Jam Ibrahim, between whom and 
the Dodtiis a feud arose on tShd,h Mahmud's accession. The Jdma 
promptly allied themselves with Mir Chdknr, a Rind Baloch of Sibi 
who had also sought service and lands frotn the Langd,h ruler and 
thereby mused the Doddis' jealousy. MirClidkuris the greatest figure 
in the heroic poetry of the Baloch, and his history is a. r«inarkable 
one. The Raids were at picture-que but deadly feud with the Lashdris. 
Gohar, the fair owner of vast herds of camels tavdured Chakur, but 
Gwaharam Lashari also claimed her hand. The rivals agreed to decide 
their quarrel by a horse race, but the Rinds loosened the girths of 
Gwahardm's saddle and Chd,kur won. In revenge the Lashd,ris killed 
some of Gohat^s camels, and this led to a desperate 30 years' war 
which ended in Chakur's expulsion from Sibi in spite of aid invoked 
and received from the Arghun conquerors of Sindh. Mir Chakur was 
accompanied by many Rinds and by his two sons, iShahzadt and 
Shaihak, and received in jdgir lands near Uch from Jdm Bayazid, 
Sammd. Later, however, he is said in the leyends to have accomftanied 
Humayun en his re-conquest of India. Hovvever this may have been, 
he undoubtedly founded a military colony of Rinds at Satgarha, in 
Montgomery, at which place his tomb still exists. Thence he was 
expelled by Sher Shdh, a fact which would explain his joining 
Humdytan. 

At this period the Baloch were in great force in the South-West 
Punjab, probably as mercenaries of the Langah dynasty of Multdn, 
but also as independent freebooters. The Rinds advanced up the 
Chenab, Hd-vi ami Sutlej valleys; the Dodd,i and Hots up the Jhelum 
and Indus. In 1519 Bd,l>ar found Dodais at Bhera and Khushab and 
he confirmed Si hrab Khan's three sons in their possession of the 
country of Sindh. He also gave Ismail Khdn, one of Sohrdb's sons, 
the ancient 'pargana of Ninduna in the Ghakhar country in exchange 
for the lands of Shaikh Bayazid Sarwdni which he was obliged to 
Burrender. But in 1524 the Arghuns overthrew Shah Mahmdd Langah 

* The founders of tbe three Dehras, which give its name to the Derajit. Dera Fath 
Khan is now a mere village. 

t Shahzad was one of miraculous origin, his mother having been overshadowed by some 
raysteiious power, and a mystical poem in Balochi on the origins of Multan is ascribed to 
iiiaa. Firishta says he first introduced the Shia creed into Multan. a curious statement.

with bis motley host of Baloch, Jdt, Kind, Dodai and other tribes, and 
the greatest contusion reigned. 

The Arghuns however submitted to the Mughal emperors, and thTs 
app^'ars to hHve thrown the bulk ot the Bal<ch into opposition to the 
empire. They rarely entered the imperidl service — a fact which is 
possibly explaiued by their dislike to serve at a distance from their 
homes — and under Akbar we read of occasional expeditiona against 
the Baloch. But the Lnshdris apparently took service with the 
Arghiins and aided them against Jdm Firoz — indeed lej^end represents 
the Laghari as invading Guzerat and on return to Kachhi as obtaining 
a grant of Gundava from the king.* The Jis-tk^nis, a Lashariclan, 
also established a principality at Mankera in the Sindh-Sngar Doab at 
this time, but most of the Lash^ris remained in Makrjin or Kachhi. 
Among the earliest to leave the barren hills of Balochistan were the 
Chdndias who settled in the Chiinriko or Ohandiika tract along the Indus, t 
in Upper Sind on the Punjab border. The Hots pressed northwards 
and with the Doddis settled at Dera Ismd,d Khdn which they held for 
200 years. Close to it; the Kulachis founded the town which still bears 
their name. Both Dera Ismail Khan and Kuldchi were eventually 
conquered by Pathans, but the Kulachis still inhabit the country round 
the latter town. South of the Jistkanis of Mankera laj the Dod^is 
of the once great Mirrdni clan which gave Naw^bs to Dera Ghnzi 
Kh^n till Nadir Shah's time. Further still afield the Mazaris settled 
in J hang and are still found at Chatta Bakhsha in that District, The 
Rinds with some Jatois and Kordis are numerous in Multan, Jhang, 
Montgomery, Shahpur and Muzaffargarh, and in the last-named 
district the Gopiings and Gurmanis are encountered. All these are 
descendants of the tribes which followed Mir Chnkur and have become 
assimilated to the Ja^t tribes with whc>m in many cases they intermarry. 
West of the Indus only has the Baloch retained his own language and 
tribal organization. 

In the Deiajdt and Sulaim^ns the Baloch are grouped into tumans 
which cannot be regarded as mere tribes. The turn an is ni. facta 
political confederacy, ruled by a turnandor, and comprising men of 
one tribe, with aflSliated elements liom other tribes not necessarily 
Baloch. The tumans which now exist as Organisations are the Marri, 
Bughti, Mazari, Drishak, Tibbi Lund, Sori Lund, Leghari, Khosa, 
Nutkani, Bozdar, Kasr6ni, Gurchdni and Shambuni. Others, such as 
the Buled/ii, Hasani, Jakrani, Kahiri, are found in the Kachhi territory 
of Kalat and in Upper Sind, with representatives in Bahdwalpur 
territory. 

The Bozdar tuman is probably in part of Rind descent, but the 
name means simply goatherd. They live in independent territory in 
the Sulaimdns, almost entirely north-west of Dera Ghazi Khan. 

The Bughti or Zarkdni tuman is composed of several elements. 
Mainly of Rind origin it claims descent from Gydndar, a cousin of 
Mir Chakur. The Raheja, a clan with an apparently Indian name, 
is said to have been founded by Raheja, a sou oi Gyandar. The No/Zidni 

* The Maghassis, a branch of the 1 asharfs, are still found in Kachh Gundiva. 
t Ch&ndias are also numerous in lUuzafargarh and Dera Ismail Khan.

clan holds the guardianship of Pir Sohri's shrine though they have 
admitted Gurchani to a share in that office, and before an expedition 
, each man passes under a yoke of guns or swords held by men of the 
clan. They can also charm guns so that the bullets shall be harmless,* 
and claim for these services a share of all crops grown in the Bughti 
country. 

The Shambd,nis, who form a s\ib-tu7na7i, but are sometimes classed 
as an independent tuman, trace their descent to Rihan, a cousin of Mir 
Chakur, and occupy the hill country adjacent to the Bughti and 
Maz^ri tumans. The Bughti occupy the angle of the Sulaimau 
Mountains between the Indus and Kachhi and have their head-quarters 
at Syahaf (also called Dera Bibrak or Bughti Dera). 

The Buleci/ii or Burdi tuman derives its name from Boleda in 
Maktan and was long the ruling race till ousted by the Gichki. It is 
also found in the Burdikd tract on the Indus, in Upper Sindh and in 
Kachhi. 

The Drishak tuman is said to be descended from one of Mir Chaknr's 
companions who was nicknanied Drishak or ' strong/ because he held 
up a roof that threatened to crush some Lashd,ri women captives, but 
it is possibly connected with Dizak in Makran. Its head-quarters are 
at Asni in Dera Ghazi Khdn. 

The Gurchdni tuman is mainly Dodai by origin, but the Syd,hph^c?fe 
Durk^ni are Rinds; as are probably the Pitafi, Jogd,ni, and Chang 
clans — at least in part. The Jistkanis and Lashdris (except the Gabolt 
and Bhand sections) are Lasharis, while the Suhri^ni and Holawdni 
are Bulei/iis. The Gurchani head-quarters are at Ldlgarh near Harrand 
in Dera Ghazi Khan. 

KasraniJ (so pronounced, but sometimes written Qaisardni as 
descended from Qaisar) is a tuman of Rind descent and is the most 
northerly of all the organised tumans, occupying part of the Sulaimans 
and the adjacent plains in Deras Ghdzi Khdn (and formerly, but not 
now), Ismail Khdn. 

The Khosas form two great tumans,^ one near Jacobdbdd in Upper 
Sindh, the other with its head- quarters at Bdtil near Dera Ghdzi Kbdn. 
They are said to be mainly of Hot descent, but in Dera Ghdzi Kl'dn the 
Isani clan is Khetran by origin, and the small Jajela clan are probably 
aborigines of the Jaj valley which they inhabit. 

The Legrhdri tuman derives its origin from Kohphrosh, a Rind, 
nicknamed Ijephd,r or 'dirty.* But the tu,man also includes a Chandia 
clan and the Haddiani and Kaloi, the sub-iwman of the mountains, 
are said to be of Bozdar orig:in. Its head-quarters are at Choti in 
Dera Ghazi Khdn, but it is also found in Sindh. 

* The following Baloch septs can stop bleeding by channa and touching the wounds, and

Gurchanis : the Shahmani sept of the Hadiani Legharis, and, among the Khosas, the

Tibbi. 



Baloch tribes, 47 

The Lunds form two tumaiis, one of Sori, with its head -quarters at 
Kot Kandiwdirt, the other at Tibbi, both in Dera Gh6zi Khan. Both 
claim descent- from Ali, son of Rihd,ii, Mir Chakur's cousin. The Son 
Lunds include a Gurcli^ni clan and form a large tuman, livin^r in the 
plain!^, but the Tibbi Lunds are a small tuman to which are affiliated a 
clan of Khosas and one of Rinds — the latter of impure descent. 

The Marri tuman, notorious for its marauding habits which neces- 
sitated an expedition against it only in 1880, is of composite origin. 
The Ghazani section claims descetit from Ghazan, son of Ali, son of 
Jal^l Khdn and the Bijardnis from Bijar Phuzh^ who revolted against 
Mir Chdkur. The latter probably includes some Pathdn elements. 
The Mazaranis are said to be Khetrdns, and the Lohar^nis of mixed 
blood, while Jatt, Kalmati, BuletZ/ii and Hasani elements have 
doubtless been also absorbed. 

The Mazaris are an organised clan of iinportancp, with bead-quarters 
at Hojhan in Dera Ghd,zi Khan. Its ruling sept, the BdMchdni, is said 
to be Hot by descent, but the rest of the tribe are Rind-^. The name 
is derived apparently from mazdr, a tiger, like the Path.ln 'Mzarai.' 
The Kirds or Kurds, a powerful Brahui tribe, also furnish a clan to 
the Mazd,ris. The Mazdris as a body (excluding the Baldchdnis) are 
designated Sydh-Uf, or 'Black-bellies.' 

Other noteworthy tribes, not organized as tumans, are — 

The Ahmd^nist of Mdnd, in Dera Gh^zi Kh^n. They claim descent 
from Gydnddr and were formerly of importance. 

The Gislikfiuris, fcund scattered in Dera Ismdil Khan, Muzaffargarh 
and Mekr^n, and claiming descent from one of Mir Chdkur's Rind 
companiouR, nick-nam^^d Gishkhaur, But the Gishkhaur is really a 
torrent in the Boleda Valley, Mekrdn, and possibly the clan is of 
common descent with the BulecZ/ii.J 

Tdlpur or Talbur, a olan of the Leghdria, is, by some, derived from 
its eponym, a son of Bulo, and thus of BulecZM origin. Its principal 
representatives are the Mirs of Khairpur in Sind, but a few Talpurs are 
still found in Dera Ghazi Khdn. Talbur literally means ' wood-cutter' 
(fr. tdl, branch, and buragh, to cut). 

The Pitdfis, a clan found in considerable numbers in Dera Ismdil 
Khan and Muza£fargarh.§ Pitdfi would appear to mean 'Southern.' 

The Nutkini or Nodhti'k&m, a compact tribe, organized till quite 
recently as a tuman, and found in Sangarh, Dera Ghdzi Khdn District. 

The Mashori, an impure clan, now found mainly in Muzaffargarh.[| 

The Mastoi, probably a servile tribe, found principally in Dera Ghdzi 
Khdn where it has no social status. 



* The Phuzh are or were a clan of Kinds, once of great importance --indeed the whole Rind 
tribe IS said to have once been called Phuzh. They are now only found at Kolanah in 
Mekran, m Kachhi and near the Bolan Pass. a xv i nau ui 

JLarge Ahmdani clans are also found among the Lunds of fori and the Haddi4ni Leghfirig. 

;itie Lashari sub-h/»na»i of the Gurohani also includes a Oishkhauri sept, and the Dombkis 
nave a clan of that name. 

§ Also as a Gurchani clan in Dera Ghazi Khin. 
The Bughtis have a Masori clan. 



48 Baloch tribes. 

The Dashti, another servile tribe, now found scattered in small 
numbers iu Deras Ismdil Khan and Gh^zi Khan, in Muzaifargarh and 
Bahdwalpur. 

'J'he Gopd,ng, or mora correctly Go\)}\anft [ic. gophanh, 'cowhprd'), 
also a servile tribe, now scattered over Kachhi, Dera Ismdil Khan, 
Multan and Muzaffargarh, especially the latter. 

The Hot (Hut) once a very powerful tribe (still so ia Mekr^n) and 
widely spread wlierever Baloches are found, but most numerous in Dera 
Ismdil Khdn, Muzaffargarh, Jhang and Multdn. 

The Jatoi, not now an organized tribe, but found wherever Baloches 
have spread, i.e., in all the Districts of the South-West Punjab and as 
far as Jhang, Shahpur and Lahore. 

The Kordi or Kauddi, not now an organized tuman, but found 
wherever Baloches have spread, especially in Dera Ismdil Khdn, Multdn 
and Muzaffargarh. 

The history of the Baloch is an instructive illustration of the trans- 
formations to which tribes or tribal confederacies are prone. The 
earliest record oftlieir organisation represents them as divided into 44 
holaks of which 4 were servile. 

But as soon as history begins we find the Baloch nation split up 
into 5 main divisions, Rind, Lashdri, Hot, Korai (all of undoubted 
Baloch descent) and Jatoi which tradition would appear to represent 
as descended from a Baloch woman (Jato) and her cousin (Murdd), 
Outside these groups are those formed or affiliated in Mekrdn, such 
as the Buled/iis, Ghazanis and Umardnis. Then comea the Doddi tribe, 
franklv of non-Baloch descent in the male line. Lastly to all these must 
be added the servile tribes, Gopdngs, Dashtis, Gliolds and others. In 
a fragment of an old ballad is a list of servile tribes, said to have been 
gifted by Mir Chakur to Bdnari, his sister, as her dower and set free 
by her : 

' The Kirds, Gabols, Gadahis, Tdlburs and the Marris of Kdhan — all 
were Chdkur's slaves.' 

Other versions add thePachdlo (now unknown) and * the rotten-boned 
Bozddrs.' Other miscellaneous stocks have been fused with the 
Baloch — such as Pathdns, Khetrdns, Jatts. 

Not one single tribe of all those specified above now forms a tuman 
or even gives its name to a tuman. We still find the five main divisions 
existing and numerous, but not one forms an organised tuman. All 
five are more or less scattered or at least broken up among the various 
tumans. The very name of hohk is forgotten — except by a clan nf the 
Rind Baloch near Sibi which is still stjled the Ghuldm (slave) holaJc. 
Among the Marris the clans are now called takdr (cf. Sindhi fakara, 
mountain), the septs phalli, and the smaller sub-divisions phnrd. 
The tuman (fr. Turkish ti'imdn, 10,000) reminds us of the Mughal 
hazara, or legion, and is a semi-political, semi-military confederacy. 

Tribal nomenclature among the Baloch offers some points of interest. 
As already mentioned the old main "divisions each bore a significant 
name. The more modern tribes have also names which occasionally 
look like descriptive nick-names or titles. Thus Lund (Pe is.) mean 



Baloch Ctistom. 49 

knave, debauchee or wanderer, just as Rind does : Khosa (Sindhi) means 
robber (and also ' fever '): AJarri in Sindhi also chatices to mean a plague 
or epidemic. Some of the clan-names also have a doubttuUy totemistic 
meaninj^ : e.g., Syah-phari/i, Hlaek-leet : (jul-phadh, Klower-fe'i't (a 
Drishak clan) : (jan-ia-gwalag-h, small red ant, (a Duikani clan) 
Kalpbur, an aromatic plant, Glinus lotoides (a Bughti clan). 

Baloch Customary Law in Dera Gbazi Kban.* 
Custom, not the Muhammadan Law prevails among the Baloch as 
a body but the Nutkiinis profess to follow the latter and to a large 
extent do in fact give effect to its provisions. Baloch often postpone 
a girl's betrothal till she is 16 years of age, and have a distmctive 
observance called the hiski,f which consists in Cristing a red cloth over 
the girl's head, either at her own h'-use or at. some pUce ag' eed upon 
by thft kinsmen. Well-to-do people slaughter a sheep or goat for a 
feast; the poorer Balocti simply distribute sweets to their guests. 
Betrothal is considered almost os binding as marri'ge, especially in 
R^janpur tahsil, and only i-npotence, leprosy or apos'asy will justify 
its breach. Baloch women ar^ not given to any one outside the race, 
pave to SHyyids, but a man may mairy any Muhammadan woman, 
Baloch, Jat or even Pathd,n, but not of course Savyid. The usual 
practice is to marry witliin ihe se^t, women beino^ sold out of it if they 
go astray. Only some sections of t'lO Nutkdni:^ admit an adult 
woman's right to arrange her own marriage ; but such a marriage, if 
effected without her guardian's consent, is considered ' black ' by all 
other Baloch. Public feeling demands strong grounds tor divorce, 
ar.d in the Jdmpur tahsil it is not customary, while unchastity is 
the only recognised jjround in Rd,jaripnr. Marriage is nearly always 
according to the orthodox Muhammadan ritual, but a foim called 
tan-hakhshi (' giving of the person ') is also recoirnised. It consists 
in the woman's mere declaration that she has given herself to her 
husband, and is virtually only used in the case ot widows* The rule 
of Rucce-'sion is equal division among the sons, except in the families 
of the Mazdri and Urishak chiefs in which tho eldest son gets a some- 
what larger share than his brothers. U!>ually a grandson got no 
share in the presence of a father's brother, but the custom now univer- 
sally recognised is that gi'andsons get their deceased fathers' share,t 
but even now in Sangnrh the right of representation is not fully 
recognised, for among the Baloch of that tahsil grandsons take 'per 
capita, if there are no sons. As a rule a widow gets a life interest in her 
husband's estate, but the Gurchanis in Jampur refuse to allow a woman 
to inherit under any circumstances. Daughters rarely succeed in the 
presence of male descendants of the deceased's grandfather equally 
remote, the Baloch of Kdjanpur and Jampur excluding the daughter 
by her father's cousin and nearer agnates ; but in Sangarh tahsil 
daughters get a share according to Muhammadan Law, provided they

do not make an unlawful marriaore.* Where the daugfhter inherits 
lier righi is not extinguisheil by her marriai^e, but the Balofh in 
Rajanpur t-ihsil msisr. tnat if marrie'l she si. all have married withm 
her lathe' 's ^/la/^i, or if unmHTi-ied tihall nanny within it, as a condi- 
tion ufii-r siiic^ssioii. The resilient son-inlaw acquires no epecial 
rights, bat tlie daughrer's son m Jdmpur and Kdjdnpur succe'eds where 
his mother would succeed. No other Baloch appear to rec'>gnise his 
right. When brother succeeds brother the whole blood excludes the 
half in Sangarh and Dera Ghd,zi Khan tahsils, but in Jd,mpur and 
Rdjanpur all the brothers succeed equally. Similarly, in Sangarh, the 
associated brothers take half and the others the remaining half. 
Sii|^ers never .succeed (exc-'pt in those few sections of the Nutkdois of 
Sangarh wnich follow Muhammadan law). A step-sou has no rights 
of succession, but may keep what his step-father gives him during his 
life-time, and, in Sangarh and Kdjanpur, may get one-third of a natural 
son's siiare by will. Adoption is not recoy^nis^d, except possibly 
among the Baloch of Sangarh, and those of Rdjanpur expressly forbid 
it. But adoption in the strict Hindu sense is quite unknown, since a 
boy can be adopted even if the adoptor has a son of his own, and 
any one can adopt or be ad' pted. In Sangarh, again, a widow may 
adopt, but only with the consent of her husband's kinsmen. The 
adopted son retains all his rights in his natural father's property, but 
in Sangarh he does not succeed his adopti^^e father if the latter have 
a son born to him after the ad -ption (a rule curiously inconsistent with 
that which allows a man to adopt a second son). Except in Jd,mpur 
tahsil, a maa may make a gift of the whole of his land to an heir to 
the exclusion of the rest, and as a rule he may also gift to his daugh- 
ter, her husband or son and to his sister and her children, but the 
Lunds and Legharis would limit the gift to a small part of the land. 
Gifts to a tion-relative are as a rule invalid, unless it be for religion, and 
even then in Jdmpur it should only be of p>irt of the estate. Death-bed 
gifts are invalid in Sangarh and Jampur and only valid in the other 
two tahsils of Dera Ghd,zi Khdn to ihe extent allowed by Muhammadan 
Law. Sons cannot en I orce a partition, but in Sangarh their consent 
is necessary to it ; yet in that and the Dera Ghdzi Khd,n tahsils it is 
averred that a fatlier can make an unequal partition (and even exclude 
a son from his share) to endure beyond his life-time. But in Jampur 
and Rd,janpur the sons are entitled to equal shares, the Mazdri and 
Drishak chiefs excepted. The subsequent birth of a son necessitates 
a fresh partition. Thus among the Baloch tribes we find no system 
of tribal law, but a mass of varying local nsuage. Primitive custom 
is ordinarily enforced, and though the semi-sacred Nutkaois in Sangarh 
tahsil consider it incumbent upon them to follow Muhammadan Law, 
even they to do not give practical effect to all its niceties. 

Birth customs. The usual Muhammadan observances at birth are 
in vogue. The hang is sounded into the child's ear by the mullah six 
days aft«r its birth and on the 6th night a sheep or cattle are slaugh- 
tered and the brotherhood invited to a feast and dance. The child

sible under Muhammadan Law,

Circumcision (sha-ie, tahor) h performed at the age of 1 or 2, by a 
tahorokh. or circumcisor who i.>4 a Domb, not a mullah or a Pirhain, ex- 
cept in the plains where a Pirhain is employed. In the hills a Baloch 
can act if no Domb be available. Ten or twelve men bring a ram 
and slaughter it for a feast, to which the boy's father (who is called 
the tahor rvnzha*) contributes bread, in the evening : next morning 
he entertains th« visitors atid they depart. In the plains rattle are 
slanyhtered and the brotherhood invited; /lewdr being also given — a 
usage not in vogue in the hills. 

Jhand, the first tonsure, is performed, pror to the circumcision, at 
the shrine of Sakhi Sarwar, the weight of the child's hair in silver being 
given to its mujdwars. 

Divorce (called sd wan as well as h7n A;) i-< effected in the hills by 
casting stones 7 times or thrice and dismissing the wife. 

Concubinage is not unusual, and concubines are called suret, but 
winzas are not known, it is said. The cl ildren by such women are 
called suretwal and receive no share in their father's land, but only 
maintenance during his life-tiTne. These surets appear, however, to 
hold a better position than the mol'id or slave women.

52 Baloch mythology. 

A namesake is amndm and a contemporary amsan. Equally simple 
are the Baloch marriage customs. The youth gives shawls to his 
betroth ed's mother and her sisters, and supplies the girl herself 
with clothes till the weddinpr. Before that occurs minstrels (doms) 
are sent out to summon the guests, and when assembled they 
make gifts of money or clothes to the bridegroom. Characteristically 
the latter's hospitality takes the form of prizes— a camel for the best 
horse, money to the best shot and a turban to the best runner. The 
actual wedding takes place in the evening, Nendr* or wedding gifts, 
the neota or tambol of the Punjab, are only made in the plains, but 
among the hill Baloch a poor man goes the round of his section and 
begs gifts, chiefly made in cash. Similarly the tribal chiefs and 
headmen used to levy benevolences, a cow from every herd, a sheep 
from every flock, or a rupew from a man who owned no cattle, when 
celebrating a wedding. It is also customary to knock the heads of the 
pair together twic*^ and a relation of tbemties together the corners of 
their c/iddar« (shawls). 

A corpse is buried at once, with no formalities, save that a 
mullah, if present, reads the jandza. Dry brushwood is heaped over 
the grave. 

Tliree or four days later the asrokhi or sehd takes place. This 
appears to be a contiibution also called pathar or mhanna, each 
neighbour and clansman of the deceased's seciiou visiting his relations 
to condole with them and makinar them a present of four annas each. 
In thw evening the relations provide them with food and they depart. 

On a chief's death the whole clan assembles to present gifts which 
vary in amount from four annas to two rupees. Six montlis afier- 
wards the people all re-assemble at the grave, the brushwood is removed 
and the grave marked out with white stones. 

Of the pre-Islamic faith of the Baloch hardly a trace remains. 
Possibly in Noci/i-bandagh [lit. the cloud-binder), surnamed the Gold- 
scatterer, who had vowed never to reject a request and never to touch 
money with his hands, an echo of some old mythology survives, 
but in Baloch legend he is the father of Gwahardm, Ch^kur's rival 
for the hand of Gohar. Yet Chdkur the Rind when defeated by the 
Lash^ris is saved by their own chief NocZ/i-bandagh, and mounted on 
his mare Phul (' Flower'). 

The Baloch is as simple in his religion as in all pise aiad fanaticism is 
foreign to his nature. Among the hill Baloch mullahs are rarely found 
and the Muhammadan fasts and prayers used to be hardly known. 
Orthodox observances are now more usual and the Qur^n is held in 
great respect. Faqirs also are seldom met with and Sayyids are 

• Also called mhanna, lit. 'contributions.' 

t See Dome, Bilochi noma, pp ti4-tii'. But Dames {The Baloch Race, p. 37) translates 
darokh by memorial canopy, apparently with good reason. Capt. Coldstream says : ' Asrokh 
is a ceremony which takes place on a certain day after a death The friends of the deceased 
assemble at his house and his heirs entertain them and prayers are repeated. The cere- 
mony of dastarhandt ov tying a fa ri on the head of the dec-^ased's heir is then performed 
by his leading relative in presence of the guests. The date varies among the different 
tumans. In Dera Ghazi Khan it is generally the 3rd day after the death : in Balochistan 
there is appearently no fixed day, but as a rule the period is longer,' 



Baloch legends. 53 

unknown.* The Baloch of the plains are however much more religioua 
outwardly, and among them Sayyida possess considerable influence 
over their murids. 

The Bugtis especially affect Pir Sohri ('the red saint') a Pirozdni of 
the Nod/ianit section. This ptV was a gOKtherd who gave his onlv 
goat to the Four Friends of God and in return they miraculously filled 
his told with goats and gave him a staff wherewith if smitten the earth 
would bring forth watt-r. Most of the goats thus given wei-e red 
{i.e., brown), but some were white with red ears. Suhri was slain by 
some Buled/iis v?ho drove oft' his goats, but he came to life again 
and pursued them. Even though they cutoff his head he demanded his 
goats which they restored to him. Sohri returned home headless and 
before he died ba^ie bis eons tie his body on a camel and make his tomb 
wherever it rested. At four different places where there were kahir 
trees it halted, and these trees are st'll there. Then it rested at the 
spot where Sohri's tomb now is, and clo.so by they buried his daughter 
who had died that very day, but it moved itself in another direition. 
Most Baloohes offer a red goat at Sohri's tomb and it is slaughtered by 
the attendants of the shrine, the flesh being distributed to all who are 
present there. 

Another curious legend is that of the prophet Dris (fr. Arab. Idris) 
who by a faqir's sarcastic blessing obtained 40 sons" at a birth. Of 
these he exposed 39 in the wilderness and the legend describes how 
they survived him, and so terrified the people that public opinion 
• compelled Dris to bring them back to liis home. Bnt the Angel of 
Death bore them all away at one time. Dris, with his wife then 
migrates to a strange land but is false'y accused of slaying the king's 
son. Mutilateil and cast forth to die he is tended by a potter whose 
slave he becomes. The king's daughter sees him, blind and without 
feet or hands, yet she falls ni love with him and insists on marrying 
him. Dris is then healed by Health, Fortune and Wisdom and 
returning home finds his 40 sons still alive! At last like Enoch he 
attains to the presence of God without dying. J 

It must not however be imagined that the Baloch is superstitious. 
His nervous, imaginative temperament makes him singularly credulous 
as to the presence of sprites and hobc<oblins in desert place, but he 
is on the whole singularly free from irratiouHl beliefs. His Mu'hamma- 
danism is not at all bigoted and is strcngly tinged with Shiaism its 
mysticism appealing vividly to his imagination." " All the poets give 
vivid descriptions 6l the Day of Judgment, the terrors of Hell and 
the joys of Paradise, mentioning the classes of men who will receive 
rewards or punishments. The greatest virtue is generosity, the crime 
demanding most severe punishment is avaiice," a law in entire accord 
with the Baloch code. One of the most characteristic of Baloch 
legends is the Prophet's Maidj or Ascension, a qnaintlv beautiful 
narrative in anthropouiorphif form § fc:;ome of the legends current

The Magassi Baloch. 



concerning Ali would appear to be Buddhist in origin, e.g., that of The 
Fig eon and the Hawk.* 

Music is popular atnong the Baloch, but singing to the damliro, a 
foui-.sirinf<ed guitar, and tlie sarindd, a tive-strmged iuatrument like 
a banjo, is contined to the Uombs. The Baloch himself uses the war, 
a wooden pipe about 'SO inches in length, bound round with t.trips of 
raw gut. Upon this is played the hung, a kind of droning accompani- 
ment to the singing, the singer himself playing it with one corner of 
his mouth. The effect is quaint but hardly pleasing, though Dames says 
that the nar accompaniments are graceful and melodious. 

The Magassi Baloch. 

The Magassi Baloch who are found in Mult^n, Muzaffarg'arh, Dera 
Ghdzi, Mi^nwdli and Jhang,t appear to be a "peculiar people" rather 
than a tribe.J As both Sunnis and Shias aie found among them 
they do not form a sect. Most of them in the above Districts are 
murids or disciples of Mian Nur Ahmad, Abbdssi, of R^janpur in Dera 
Ghdzi Kbdn, whose grandfather Muhammad Xrii's shrine is in 
Mid,nwd,li. The Magassis in Balochist^n are, however, all disciples of 
Hazrat Ghaus Bahd-ud-Din of Mult^n. Like all the murids of the 
Miin, his Magassi disciples abstain from smoking and from shaving 
the bpard. Magassis will espouse any Muhammadan girl, but never 
give daiitjhters in marriage outside the group, and strictly abstain 
from Hny connection with a sweeper woman, even though she be a 
cnnvprt ti) Isl^m. At a wedding sU the Magassi who are murids of the 
Midn assemble at the bride's home a dny before the procession and are 
feasted by her parents. The guests offer prayers § to God and the Midn 
for the welfare of the married pair. This feast is called shddmdna\\ and

II In Leiah a i^hddmdna is said to be observed on occasions of great joy or sorrow All the 
members and followers of the " Sarai ' or Abbassi family ass'^mble and first eat meat cooked 
with snlt only and bread containing sugar, the leavings being distributed among the poor 
after prayers have been recited. Every care is taken to prevent a crow or a dog from 
touching this food, and those who prepare it often keep the mouth covered up. A shddmdna 
is performed at the shrines of ancestors. It is a solemn rite and prayers aie said in 
common. A boy is not accepted as a disciple by the Pir until he is circumcised, and until 
he is so accepted he cannot take part in a shddmdna.

precet^es all tbe other rites and ceremonies. Contrary to Muhammadan 
usape a Maprassi bridegroom may consnmmate his marriafro on the 
very first niglit of the we'idinyr procession and in tlio Imu.-e of the 
bride's father. At a funeral, wheth-r of a male or female, the rela- 
tives repeat the four takhirs, if they art^ Sunnis, but disciples of the 
Mi4n recite the jannza of the Shfas. Magassis, when they metit one 
another, or any other viurid of the Midn Sdhib, shake and kiss each 
other's hands in token of their hearty love and union. 

The Magassi in Leiah are Shias and like all Shias avoid eating the 
hare. But the following customs appear to be peculiar to the Magassi 
of this tahsil : When a cliild is born the water in a cup in stirred 
with a knife, which is also touched with a bow smeared with horse-dung 
and given to the child to drink. The sixth nigtit after a male birth is 
kept HS a vigil by both men and women, the latter keeping apart nnd 
singing sihrd songs, while among the men a mirdsi beats his drum. 
This is called the chhati. On the 14th day the whole brotherhood is 
invited to asseiTible, women and all, and tlie boy is presented to them. 
The doyen of the kinsman is then asked to swing the cliild in his 
cradle, and for this he is given a rupee or a turban. From 14 paos to 
as many sers of gur and salt are then distributed among the kinsmen, 
and the boy is taken to the nearest well, the man who works it being 
given a dole of siij^ar and bread or flour. This is the rite usually 
called ghari gharoli, and it ought to be observed on the 14th day, 
but poor people keep it on the day after the chhati. The tradition is 
that the chhatti and ghari gharoli observances are kept, because 
Amir Hamza was borne by the fairies from Arabia to the Caucasus 
when he was six days old, dud so every Baloch boy is careful? guarded 
on the sixth night at'ter his birth. Amir Hamza was, indeed, brought 
back on the 14th day, and so on that day the observances are kept 
after a boy's birth. For this reason too, it is said, the bow is strung ! 
All wedding rites take place at night, and on the wedding night a 
couch and bedding supplied by the bridegroom are taken to the 
bride's house by mirasis, who sing songs on the way, and get a rupee 
as their fee. The members of the bridegroom's family accompany 
them. This is called tbe sejband. 

At a funeral five takhirs are recited if the mullah happens to bo 
a Shia, but if he is a Sunni only four are read. The nimdz in use 
are those of the Shias. 

The Baloch as a criminal tribe* 

The Baloch of Karniil and Ambdla form a criminal community. 
They say they were driven from their native land in the time of 
Nadir Shdh who adopted severe measures to check their criminal 
tendencies, but they also say that they were once settled in the Qasur 
tract near Lahore and were thence expelled owing to their marauding 
habits. They give a long genealogy of their descent from Abraham 
and derive it more immediately from Rind, whose descendants, they 
say, are followers of the Imdm Shdfi and eat unclean things like the 
Awdns, Qalandars, Mad^ris and the vagrant Baloch who are known as 



66 SaMch'-'BangdU. 

Hnburag. Gullu they insert in their gfenealogy as the ancestor of the 

Giloi Baloch. Speakino^ an argot of their own called Balnchi Fdrwi, 

tl>ey are skilful burglars and wander preat distances, disguised as 

faqirs and butchers. When about to start on a plundering expedition 

sardnrs or chiefs are appointed as lenders, and on its termination they 

divide the spoil, receiving a double portion for thems^'Ives. Widows 

also receive their due share of the booty. The Giloi Baloch of Lyallpur, 

however, claim descent from Sayyid " Giloi," a nickname paid to mean 

" freebooter." This tribe was formerly settled in the Montgomery 

District, but has been transplanted to two villages in Lyallpur and 

is settling down to cultivation, thougli it still associates with criminals 

in Ferozepur, Montgomery and Bahdwalpur. It now makes little use 

of its peculiar patois.

The Bangash. 6!? 

The Bangalig are a small group, Vmt aro in constant communication 
with tlio Sapehras and other criminal tribes of the plains. They live 
by bf'gging, exhibiting snakes, hunting and pilfering, but are probably 
not a'ldicted to serious crimo. Their camps are said to contain never 
less than 7 or more than 15 male adults. They make reed huts and 
can strike camp on the shortest notice, travelling with donkeys as 
pack-animals. Dogs arc kept for hunting, ancl the Bangdli will eat 
any wild animal, even a hyajua, but he eschews beef or pork according 
to the prejudices of the people among whom ho finds himself. There is 
said to be a special Bangali argot, known only to the tribe. Their women 
are prostitutes, os well as dancers and singers. Besides propitiating 
local deities the Bang^lis arr^ said to specially affect Sakhi Sarwar as 
* Lakhdd,tcl ' and occasionally visit bis shrine at Dharnikot near Nasirdbdd. 
(3) The term Bangali is applied to Kanjar in some districts and in 
others to any 8apd-da or snake-charmer in the plains.* There is no 
evidence that (2) or (3) have any connection with Bengal. In Panjabi 
Bangdli means a braggart, as in hhukhkhd Bangali, a boastful person. 
Bangash, BANGAKH.t This is the name given to a number of Pathdn 
tribes, formerly estimated to amount to some 100,000 families, as well 
as to the tract of mountainous country wliich they held. This tract 
was onc6 divided into Bella (Upper) and Pdin (Lower) Bangash and 
was thence called the Ban^ashat (in the plural) or Hhe two Bangash.' 
The first historical rafntion of the Bangashat occurs in Babar's Tuzi'ik, 
but the two tracts had long been under the control oi the Turk and 
Mughal rulers of the Ghazniwi empire as the most practicable routes from 
Ghazni and Kdbul into India lay through them. At a period when 
the Khataks and Orakzais are barely referred to, we find constant 
mention of the Afghans of Bangash. Roughly speaking, Upper 
Bansrash included Kurram and Lower Bangfash the country round 
Kohat, but it is difficult to define accurately the shifting boundaries of 
the turtidn as it was called by the Mughal*. According to the Ain-i- 
Akbari this tumdn formed part of the sarkclr and subah (province) of 
K^bul. 

The Afghan tribes of Bangash were of Kurani (KarMrni) origin and 
the following table gives their traditional desceut : —

The Baizai, descendants of Bai, and the Malik-Miris or Miranzais,

and to thef^e were affilinted the Katrhzi, descended from Kilkhai or 
Kilghai, daughter of Malik Mir, by ahu<band of an unknown tribe. The 
Malik-Miris, as Malik Mir's descendants in the male line, held tho 
chieftainship, but it subsequently passed to the Baizais. The latter

lias several brandies, the Mardo, Azu, Lodi and Sh^liu khels. The 
Miranzai khels are the Hassan zai, with the Badah, Khdkhd, and Umar 
khel^^. A third branchy the Shamilzai,"^ apparently identical with the 
Kdghzi, produced the Laudi, Hassan Khel, Musa Khel and Isa Khel. 

Like the other Karlarni tribes the Afghans ot Bangash were 
disciples of the Pir-i-Roshdn, and tlieir attachment to that heresy 
brought about their ruin, the Mnghnl government ore^anizing 
conaiant expeditions against them. Afier the Khataks had moved 
towards tlie noith-ea^t from tlie Shuwal range (in Waziristdn),t the 
Baizai, Malik-Miris and Kaghzis then settled in the Upper Bangash, 
invaded the Lower (Koh^t) and, in alliance with the Khataks, drove 
the Orakzai who then held the Lower Bangash westNvards into Tirdh. 
This movement continued till the reign of Akbar.| 

The history of the Bangash tribes and the part they took 
in the Mughal operations against the Boshanias are obscure. Probably 
they were divided among themselves. § but those of them who had 
remained in Kurram appear to have adhered to the Eoshania doctrines. 

After Aurangzeb's accession in 1659, we find Sher Muhammad Khdn, 
of Koh^t, chief of the Malik-Miris, in revolt against the Mughals. He 
was captured, but subsequently released and became an adherent of the 
Mughals. Khushhdl Khan the Khatak gives a spirited account of his 
little wars with Sher Muhammad Khan which ended m his own defeat 
and the final establishment of the Bangash in their present seats. 

Among the Bangash Pathdns of Kohat, betrothal {kwazda, ' asking') 
is privately negotiated, the boy's father taking the initiative. Then a day 
is fixed upon for the father and his friends to visit the girl's father. At 
the latter's house prayers are read and swee's distributed, the nikdh 
being sometimes also read on this occasion. But as a rule the girl simply 
puts on a gold or silver coin as the sign that she is betrothed. If the 
wedding is to be celebrated at no distant date, the rarmana or bride- 
price is paid at the betrothal — otherwise it is not paid till the wedding. 
But a price is invariably expected, its amount varying from Ks. 100 to 
1,000, and Ihe boy's father also has to supply the funds for entertaining 
the wedding party on the wedding day. The day following the 
betrothal pitchers of milk are exchanged by the two parties and the 
milk is drunk by their kinsfolk. The boj's father also sends the girl 
a «uit of clothes and some cooked food on each Id and the Shabrat. 

On the day fixed for the commencement of the festivities sweets are 
distributed by the boy's father among his friends and kinsmen and music 
is played. Three days before the weddmg comes the kenaiii(il,yvhen the 
boy's kinswomen visit the bride and observe this rite, whicli consists in 
stripping the bride of all her ornaments and shutting her up in a room 
by herself. The next night the women visit her again for the kamei 
Wdasical or unplaiting of her hair. For this the barber's wife receives 
a fee. On the third day the bridegroom gives a feast to all his friends

and follow-villagors, and in tlio afternoon he and hia friends don 
garlands. Tho neundra is also presented on this day. Then the boy 
and his wedding party go to the bridn'a house, returning that same 
night if it is not too far away, or else remaioing there for the night. 
On the fourth day in the morniner churi is given to tho woddinf pHrty 
and coloured wafer pprinklod on them, some m^ney being placed on the 
dish used fr.r the cJitiri as the perquisite of the bridle's barber. After a 
meal the girls of the party, accompanied by tho bri.legroom's b^st man 
[sauhhalnd) , go to a spring or- well to fetch water in which the bride 
bathes. This is called ghari gharol, as it often is in tho Punjab. 
Then the pair are dressed in new clothes and the nikdh is solemnized. 
Some parents give their daughter a dowry of cl thes and ornaments, 
called flarganni mdl or ' paternal wealth.' On the next day but one 
after the wedding churi* is brought from the brid -'s house to the bride- 
groom's — an observance called tirah. On the seventh day, nwamma wraj, 
the bride is fetched to her house by her kinswom' n, but three or four 
days later she returns to her husband, sometimes with more presents of 
clothes and ornaments from h-r parents. 

The ]3angnsh of Kohslt are tall and good looking, they shave the 
head and cHp the beard like the people of Peshdwar. Though neat in 
dress which is generally white, they have not much courage. Tho 
Shiah Bangasht are much braver. In Upper Miranzai the Bangash 
still affect the dark blue turban and shirt, with a ^rey sheet for a lungi, 
which were once common to the whole tribe — as Elphinstone noted. 
They shave the head and eradicate tnost of the hair on the chin and 
cheeks, leaving little but the ends of the moustache and a Newo-ate 
fringe. Young men often wear love locks and stick a rose in the 
turban— when they feel themselves irresistible. The mullds have not 
yet succeeded in preaching down the custom of clipping tho beard. 
The Miranzai woaien wear the ordinary blue shift with a loose trousers 
of susi and a shirt, but the shift is often studded with silver coins 
and ugly silk work. Few other ornaments are worn.

and the Biinia by caste, as his name implies, lives for and by com- 
merce. He holds a considerable area of land in the east of the Pro- 
vince ; bnt it is very rarely indeed that ho follows any other than 
mercantile pursuits. The commercial enterprise and intelligence of tho 
clnss is preat, and tlie dealings of some of tho great Banii houses of 
Dohli, Bikaner, and Marwar are of the most extensive nature. But 
the Bdnia oP the village, who represents the great ma'sa of the caste, 
is a poor creature, notwithstanding the title of Mahtljan or " great 
folk," which is confined by usage to the caste to which he belongs.

60 The Bdnia organisation. 

He spends bis life in his shop, and the results are apparent in his in- 
ferior physique and utter want of manliness. He is looked down upon 
by the peasantry as a cowardly inoney-grubbe^r ; but at the same 
time his social standing is from one point of view curiously higher 
than theirs, for he is what they are not, a strict Hindu; he is generally 
admifted to be of pure Vaisya descent, he wears the janeo or sacred 
thread, his periods of purification are longer than theirs^ he does not 
practise widow-mart in ge, and he will not eat or drink at their hands ; 
and religious ceremonial and the degrees of caste proper are so 
interwoven with the social fabric that the resulting position of the Bania 
in the grades of rustic society is of a curiously mixed nature. The B^nia 
is hardly used by the proverbial wisdom of the countryside : " He 
who has a Bdnia for a friend is not in want of an enemy j" and, 
''First beat a Bdnia, then a thief." And indeed the Banid has too 
strong a hold over the husbandman for there to be much love lost 
between them. Yet the money-lenders of the villages at least have 
been branded with a far worse name than they deserve. They 
perform functions of the most cardinal importance in the village 
economy, and it is surprising how much reasonableness and honesty 
there is in their dealings with the people so long as they can keep 
their business transactions out of a court of justice. 

Organisation. — The organisation of the Baniiis is exceedingly obscure. 
They have certain territorial divisions, but there is also a true sub- 
caste, called Bdra-Saini"^ in Gurgaon, which is said to be quite distinct 
from the others. They are descended from Chamdrs and at marriage 
the boy wears a miikat or tiara of dak leaves, shaped like a basket, into 
which a piece of leather is fixed. 

The territorial groups are at least three in number. Of these the 
> chief is the Ag'i.'arwAls, and there is a curious legend about their origin. 

Bdshak Ndg had 17 dangliters, who Avere married to the 17 sons of 
Ugar Sain, but these snake daughters of Bashak used to leave their 
homes by night to visit their parents, and in their absence their hus- 
bands lived with their handmaidens, and descendants of the-^e are the 
Dasa or Chhoti-sarn gots of the Banids, each got taking its name from 
that of the handmaiden from whom it is de(«cended. The children of 
Bdshak N/ig^s daughters formed the 17 gots\ of the Aggarwal. Once 
a buy and girl of the Goyal got were married by mistake and their

The seconc^ group is the Saralia, who aro an off-shoot of the 
Aggarwdl and appeur to have the same gots. 

The third group, the Osvval, appears to form a true sub-cas^e.t They 
strenuously claim a Puuwar Rajput origin, but other Kajputs of 
various tribes joined them. They followed one of their Bra'hmans iu 
becoming Jains, in Sambat 422. 

Hence there are tl-.ree territorial groups or sub-castes, aud a fourth 
of lower status bftsed on descent: —

Sub-caste IT. Saralia, from Sara la. J P^^''"^- 

Sub-caste III. Oswal, — from Osianagri — in Eastern Rajputana. 
Sub-caste IV. Biira-Saini. 

Apparently tliere are, besides these tf-rritorial groups, cross-divisions 
of the caste based on religious diffarences. These seem to be Saraogi 
or Jain, Maheshri or Shaiva, Aggarwal-Vishnoi or Vaishnavaa. 
But the Maheshri, who undoubtedly derive their name from Mahesli 
or Shiva, are not now all Shaivas, for one of their number was in 
consequence of a miracle converted to Jainisru and so founded the 
Talitar got of the Oswal, among whom the Kamfiwat got is also 
Maheshri. It would appear that the Shaiva groups formed true sub- 
castes, for the Maheshri certainly do not intermarry with the Aggarw:ll 
(»r Osw^l§ though Vaishnava and Jain Aggarwd,ls intermarry freely in 
Gurgaon.

62 The Bdnias in Bdwal — Banjdra. 

But from the extreme sonth-eaat of the Punjab comos the following account which 
differs widely from those pjiven above. The Bawal nizdmat borders on Rajputana, and 
formrt part of Nablia, in which State ho Banids are represented by four proups : — 
(I) AggHrwil. (2) Rnstagi, (3) Khandelwal, (4) Mahi'ir, who rank in this order, each 
group being able to take water from the one above it, but not vice versi. 

(i). The Aggarwilfl of Bawal msdmnnn N4bha perform all the ceremonies observed 
by the Brahmans of thnt tract, but they have a special custom of boring the ears and 
noses of clildren, both male and female. This is called parojan. For this ceremony 
they keep some of the rice used at the lagan preceding a wedding in another family; and 
carry tho deotas, which are usually kept in the parohifs chaige to their own house. 
The deotas are worshipped for seven days. The pandit fixes a mahurat or auspicious 
time for the boring and the rite is then performed, a feast being given to Brahmans and 
relatives. In the case of a boy, he is made to sit on a he-goat which is borrowed for tho 
occasion and alms are given, a present being al'^o made to the boy. In Nabha town 
some Aggarwal families perform this ceremony, but others do not, 

(ii). The Rustagi* group is found only in the Bawal nizdmat, in Gurgaon, Delhi, 
Alwar, Budaon, Bulandshahr and Gwalior. They are most strongly represented in 
Bawal, at Bhora in Rewari tahsil and at Barand in Alwar State, hut probably do not 
e/cceed 1,000 families in the whole of India. Though in marriage they only avoid one 
got, yet owing to the paucity of the numbers the poorer members cannot get wives and 
so die unmarried. They say that Rohtasgarh was their original home and that their 
name Kustagi is derived from Rohta*. They have 18 gots named after the villagea which 
they originally inhabited. They avoid widow re-marriage, but do not invariably wear 
the janeo, as the Aggarwals do. They perform the first hair-cutting of a boy at Nagar- 
kot or Dahni in Alwar at the asthdn of Devi. They observe the milni, i.e. when the 
parents of a betrothed couple meet the girl's father must give the boy's father from one 
to twenty-one rupees, and the girl's father must not visit the village where his daughter 
has been betrothed until afrer the marriage under the penalty of paying the milni, 
but once paid it is not payable a second time. At the Dewali Rustagfs pay special 
reverence to their sati. They are all Vaishnavaa and also worship Gopi Nath. The 
bardt must arrive the day before the wedding, but they have no other special marriage 
customs. 

[Hi), The Khandelwals are few in number. They have 72 gots, the principal one in 
Nabha State being the Bajolia. They claim to have come from Khatu Khandela in 
Jaipur. The hardt in this group also arrives the day before the wedding but the boy's 
father has to feed the bard himself on that day. Like the Ahirs the Khandelwals on 
the widai day have a special custom. The women of the bride's family cloths the boy's 
father in yellow clothes and put a pitcher of water on his head, with a necklace of 
camel's dung round his neck and compel him to go and worship the well just as the 
women do. He only escapes after much teasing by paying them from 11 to 51 rupees. 
They do not wear the janeo, and as they are devotees of Bhagwan Das, Mahatma, of Tikha 
in the B4wal Th^na they do not smoke or sell tobacco. 

(iv). The Mahur are few in number in Bawal. They have two gots Mawal and Kargas. 
They are Vaishnavas and specially reverence Han-uman. 

Banjara. — This and the Labana caste are generally said to be identical^t 
being called Banjara in the eastern districts and Lahdna in the Punjab 
proper. But Banjd,ra, derived from hanij, 'a trader', or perhaps from 
hdnji 'a pedlar's pack,' is used in the west of tho Punjab as a generic 
term for ' pedlar.' Wanjdra {q. v.) is doubtless only another form of 
the name. 

The Banjdras of the eastern districts are a well-marked class, of 
whom a complete description will be found in Elliott's JBaces o/" //le 
JV.-W. P., I, pp. 52—56. They were the ^reat travelling traders and 
carriers of Central India, the Deccan and R^iput^na ; and under the

Maheeri Saraogi and Kalal, and in Gurgaon it is said that the Saraogi and Vishnav (sic)

t In Southern India the Brinjara is also called Lawanah or Lumbana (fr. Hti, Sanskr 
lavan, ' salt'). See also und« Multmi.

Banjdra'^Bannvchi. 63 

Afghdn and Mughal empires were the commissariat of the imperial 
forces. A simile applied to a dying person is : 

Bnnjitra han tnen fhire liye lakrid hath; 
Tdnda icdhd lad gay a, koi sangi nahin sdth. 

*^The Banjara goes into the jungle with hin stick in his hand. 
He is ready for the journey, and there is nobody with him." 

From Sir H. Elliott's description they seem to bo a very composite 
class, including sections of various origin. But the original Banjara cHste 
is said to have its habitat in the sub-montane tract from Gorakhpur to 
Hard war. The Banjdras of the United Provinces come annu«lly into 
the Jumna districts and Eastern States in the cold weatVier with letters 
ot credit on the local merchants, and buy up large numbers of cattle 
which they take back again for sale as the summer approaclies; and 
theee men and the Banjara carriers from Rajputana are principally 
Hindus. The Musalman Banjdras are probably almost all pedlars. 
The headmen of the Banjara parties are called ndih (Sanskrit 
ndyaka, "chief) and Banjaras in general are not uncommonly known 
by that name. The Railways are fast destioying the carrving 
tiade of these people except in the mountain tracts. The word hanjdra 
is apparently sometimes used for an oculist, and any Hindu pedlar is 
so styled. Synonyms are bUdti or manidr in the central, and lanati 
in the eastern districts, and, amongst Muhammadans, khoja aud pardcha. 
In Amritsar their gots are said to include M;inh^s, Khokhar and 
Bhatti septs, and they have a tradition that Akbar dismissed Chaudhri 
Shah Quli from his service whereupon he turned trader or banjara. 

Bannuchi. — The hybrid branch of the Pathdns which holds tlie central 
portion of the Bannu tahsil, between the Kurram and Tochi rivers. 
This tract they occupied towards the close of the 1 4th century, after 
being driven out of Shawal by the Wazirs and in turn drivin"- tho 
Mangal and Hanni tribes back into Kohat and Kurram. The Banndchis 
have attracted to themselves Sayyids and other doctors of Isldm in 
great numbers, and have not hesitated to intermarry with these, with 
the scattered representatives of the former inhabitants of their tract 
who remained with them as hamsdyn, and with the families of the 
various adventurers who have at different times settled amongst them; 
insomuch that "■ Bannuchi in its broadest sense now means all Muham- 
madans, and by a stretch, even Hindus long domiciled within the limits 
of the irrigated tract originally occupied by the tribe." The descend- 
ants of Shitak, however, still preserve the memory of their separate 
origin and distinguish themselves as Bannuchi proper. They are of 
inferior physique, envious, secretive, cowardly, lying, great bigots, 
inoffensive, and capital cultivators. Sir Herbert Edwardes says of 
them : ' The Bannuchis are bad specimens of Afijhans ; can worse bo 
said of any race ? They have all the vices of Pathans rankly luxuriant, 
their virtues stunted.' Their Isakhi clan, however, is famed for the 
beauty of its women. ' Who marries not an Isakhi woman deserves an 
aes for a bride.' 

Shitak, a Kakai Karlaori, by his wife Bannu had two sons, Kiwi and 
Surani. The former had also two sons, Miri and Sami. To Miri's 
tioub fell the boutb, to Sami's the centre, and to Surani's tho north and

west of Datid, the modern Bannu, which was named after Shitak's wife. 
When Bannu became a part of the kingdom of Kabul the Bannuchis 
split into two factions, ' black ' and ' white/ which left them a prey to 
the Wazirs. 
Banot, a sept of Hindu Rdjputs, which holds a hurah or^roup of 12 villages 
near Garhshankar in Hoshidrpur. The Banot say they ure of the same 
origin as the Narus, and the name is said to mean ' shadow of the 
ban' or forests of the Siwaliks in which they once dwelt. 

Bansi, a class of musicians, players on the pipe {bans) at temples and 
village shrines, but virtually employed in the same way as Halis or 
Sipis, in Chamba.

Tantravdya (weaver) and employed in cultivating betel (Colebrooke, 
Essays, 272-3). 

Baeakzai, a famous clan of the Abdali or Darrdiui Afghans which sap- 
planted the Sadozai family of that branch early in the 19th century. 
Its most famous members were Fath Kh&n and Dost Muhammad his 
brother. The latter took the title of amir after Shdh Shuj^'s failure 
to recover Qandahar in 1834 and founded the present ruling house of 
Afghanistan: (for its history see M. Longworth Dames in The Ency- 
clopsedia of Islam, 1908).

Baear, fern. Barfi, alow caste given to begging and roguery. In Jullundur 
the Baiars make winnowing fans {chhaj), baskets, and sieves (chhanra) 
of reed. They also hunt with dogs. Their observances resemble those of 
the Chuhras. At a wedding one of the caste is selected to officiate, and 
he kindles the fire and makes the couple go round it. The bride's 
■ parents keep the wedding party one or three days, feeding its members 
on ricej sugar and bread. On its departure the girl's father gives her

Babdkhel families and one branch of it is called Suddkhel. Elphin- 
stonet describes the Barakkis as a class of Tdjiks, mixed with the 
Ghiljis (Gliil/.ais or possibly Khilchis). The Barakkis are also 
described as a T.1jik people, speaking a language of their own, and

Baewala, Batwal. These two names, though probably of different origin, 

are used almost as synonyms, the former being more common in the 

lower hills and the latter ia the moantain ranges of Kangra\ But in 

Chamba the Barw^ld is clearly distinct from the Batwal, being a maker 

of mats and winnowing fans, and the name is probably derived from 

lara or haria, the kind of grass used for them. Batwal or hatwdr on the 

other hand means a tax collector, and hatwdl is an ordinary peon of any 

caste even a Brahman, though of course he may be by caste a Batw^l.:{: 

At the capital, Chamba, Barwdlds used to be employed as watchmen 

and thus went up in the social scale as Batwdls. In Kdngra however 

the Batwal form a true caste, while Barwald, is little more than 

the name of an occupation. Both words correspond very closely 

with the Lahbar or Baldhar of the plains, and denote the village 

■watchman or messenger. In the higher hills this office is almost

± Dr J. Hutchison notes regarding the Batwils of Chamba that they claim descent from 
Siddh kaneri, a deified ascetic of whom they know nothing. Formerly employed as watch- 
en a few are still enlisted in the State Police. Barwalas and Batwals are all Hindus and 
have their own gotras, but Brahmans do not officiate at their weddings, which are solemnised 
hv two literate men of the caste. Their observances follow the usage of the locality in which 
thev aie settled. Thus in Chamba the biyah or full wedding rite is observed as among the 
hiffh castes though expense is curtailed and the ceremonies abridged. A Brahman fixes the 
day of the wedding. The dead are burut.

coDfined to the BatwdMs, while in the lower hills it is porformed by 
men of various low castes who are all included under the generic term 
of Barwald. These men are also the coolies of the hills, and in fact 
occupy much the same position there as is hehi by the Chamdr s in the 
plains, save that they do not tan or work in leather. In Kdngra they 
are also known as Kirjlwak or Kirauk, a word which properly means a 
raan whose duty it is to assemble coolies and others for begdr or forced 
labour, and they are also called Satwiig or " bearers of burdens." Like 
most hill menials they often cultivate land, and are employed as 
ploughmen and field labourers by the Rajputs and allied racfs of tho 
hills who are too proud to cultivate with their own hands. They are 
true village menials, and attend upon village guests, fill pipes, bear 
torches, and carry the bridegroom's palanquin at weddings and the hko, 
and receive fixed fees for doing so. In the towns they appear to be 
common servants. They are of the lowest or almost tho lowest standing 
as ih caste, apparently hardly, if at all, above the Dumua or sweeper of 
the hills ; but the Batwal has perhaps a slightly higher standing than 
tho Barwfil^. Indeed the name of Barwala, is said to bo a corruption of 
6a/iarwa^a or " outsider," because, like all outcasts, they live in the 
outskirts of the village. 

At Batwdl weddings in Sialkotthe learned among tho Meghs officiate. 
The Batwdls have Brahman priests, but they do not conduct their 
marriage rites : they also avoid contact with them. The Batwd-la 
marry their girls at an early age, but allow widow-remarriage, and that 
too without regard to the husband's brother's claims. Two gots only are 
avoided. Batwdls* are menials. 

Birth observances. — Four or twelve months after the birth of a boy 
ritan are observed as follows : — Loaves of bread fried in oil are arranged 
in piles, seven in each heap, and the head of each family takes a nile and 
distributes it among its members. Only those who belong to the got in 
which the birth has taken place can take part in this feast. Among tho 
Jhanjotra the head of a boy or girl is not shaved till the child begins 
to talk. Sometimes a bodi is retained, as among Hindus. 

Their wedding ceremonies are thus described : — 

Four posts are fixed in the ground and four more placed over these. 
On these four latter two turbans, supplied by the fathers or guardians of 
the bride or bridegroom, are spread. Then tlie bride's father places 
her hands in those of the bridegroom, saying : ' In God's name I give 
you this girl (my daughter or relation).' Then the pair, the bride's 
hands clasped in the bridegroom's, walk round an earthen pitcher 
placed inside the four upright posts. This duly done, the marriage ia 
completed.t On his way home the bridegroom has to wind some raw 
cotton seven times round a shrub. 

Tho Batwdls either burn or bury their dead. In cither case on tho 
way to the ground they halt and place two balls of leavened barley 
bread at the shoulders, and tvio at the feet, of the corpse. Thirteen

Bhi, a J^t clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

Battar, a Jd,t sept. 

Batti, a Hindu Kamboh clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Bauria, Bawakia. The following is Sir Denzil Ibbetson's account of the 
B^iuria groups : — " They are said to be divided into three sections : the 
Bidiiwati of Bikiiner who trace their origin to Bidiiwat in Jaipur, do 
not eat carrion, disdain petty theft but delight in crimes of violence, 
will not steal cows or oxen, and affect a superiority over the rest; 
the Jangali or Kiilkamlia, also called Kdldhaballia — fr. dhabla, a skirt, 
the blanket, kanial, forming a petticoat, — generally found in the 
Jangaldes of the Sikh States, Ferozepore, and Sirsa, and whose women 
wear black blankets ; and the Kd.paria who are most nnmeroua in the 
neighbourhood of Dehli, and are notoriously a criminal tribe. The 
three sections neither eat together nor iutermariy. The Kalkamlia 
is the only section which are still hunters by profession, the other 
sections looking down upon that calling. The K^paria are for the 
most part vagrant ; while the Biddwati live generally in fixed abodes." 

This account is amplitied in an interesting account of the tribe by 
Mr. H. L. Williams of the Punjab Police. He gives the following 
table of their tribal system which is clearly based on the usual 
principle of territorial and other groups which cross-divide the natural 
sections* : — 



* As regards the Baurias in Lyallpur Mr. J. M. Dunnett writes : — 

" There is a further and occupational division among tho Baurias, Non- cultivators are 
Kapria, Gumria, and Gadera, while Kaldhablia, Deswalia, Dewawate and Labana are culti- 
vators. The division, I think, really means that some live by himting pure and simple, the 
others combining agriculture with it. At any rate the difference in izzat is so great that 
intermarriage between two divisions is imknown. Why Gadera, which must mean a shep- 
herd, is classed as iion- agriculturist, while Lab^nas, who hunt pigs are classed as cultivators 
I do not know."

Buuria beliefs, 73 

Besides the derivation from bdwar, a saarc, which is the one usually 
given, Mr. Williams records other traditions aa to tho origio of the 
name * Bauria/ According' to one thu emperor Akbar demandnd a 
dold from S.iiidal, Hiij;! of Uhitor, and on the lattor's refusing, a battle 
was fought, in which some of the waniors werr) engaged near a bdolt 
or well. Those on the Rajput side were called Baolias or Bawaliag. 
A third explanation is that, after the capture of Chitor, a young man of 
one of the tribes which had taken to the jun^^les saw aud love J a 
Rajput mai(i of good lineage. They were married, but the young man 
returned to jungle life aud was called Baola (imbecile) by tho brido'a 
relations for doing so, or on account of his uncouth manner. Mr. 
Williams' account continues : — 

" IVadition says that the Bd-warias are descendants of Chanda and 
Jora, and when Fatta and Jaimal, Rd.jputs of tho Surajbans or Solar 
race, were joint Riijas of Cliitor, Shnh^b-ud-din of Ghor assailed th« 
fortress. It was defended by the Rd,jputs and their feudal military 
classes, of whom the Bhils were the professi(jnal bowmen ; the Aheris, 
the skilled swordsmen ; and the B^warias, the bandukchis^ or musket- 
eers. In this connection the Bdwarias, although claiming Rajput 
origin, do not profess to have been the equals of the Hdjput ruling 
class, but rather their va-^sals or feudatories. Some few Bdwarias 
still wear the Rajput badge of metal kara, or ring, on the right ankle. 

"Of the now outcaste tribes, whom the Bawarias recognize as having 
shared with them the defence of (Jhitor, the Gridi Lobars, or wandering 
cutlers, are not only distinguished by the Rd'jpnt clan designations and 
silver and metal karas, but openly proclaim that they are doomed to a 
wandering existence till the Rajput power is again established in Chitor. 

" The Bidawati Bd,warias and others, whose place of origin is said to be 
Chhauni Bahddurjtn in Bikd,ner, claim to be descendants of Rd-jd, Hasdlu. 

"Religion. — The religion of the Bawarias is ancestor worship com- 
bined with allegiance to certain deities who are common to them and 
other outcaste or foul-feeding tribes." Mr. Williams then remarks that 
several Bd,waria cluns affect Guga, many of their members wearing 
silver amulets with his image in relief. It would appear that the cult 
of Giiga is specially affected by the clans of Chauhd,n descent, as Guo-a 
was a Riijput of that tribe and is peculiarly the patron of all clans which 
claim Chauhdn origin. The Bhdtis and other groups also affect Guga, and 
such groups as worship him do not affect Devi. Mr. Williams adds : — 

" Rdm Deo, supposed to have been an incarnation of Krishna, was 
the pon of Ajmal, a Kfljput of Ranchhal. He is specially reverenced 
by the PHnwd.r sept and several of the wanderintj tribes. Siinilarly 
Kd,li, Laltii Masdni and other deities have devotees amonj? the 
Bawarias. But the criminal members of the tribe make a special cult 
of Narsingh and pay their devotions to him in the following manner:— 
When planning a criminal expedition, a chiriUjh filled with (fhl is 
ignited and a live coal placed beside it, (jhi and Jialivd are added till 
both are in flatne ; on the smoke and fumci^, called Jiom, arisin<T, tlie 
persons present fold their hands and make supplication, saying : ' He, 

* Similarly tho Machhis or Jhiwars claim to have been artillerists in the Native Indian 
Armies.'and they also manufactured gunpowder, shot being made by the Lobars, 



74 The Bdurias in Gurgaon. 

Nar Singh, through thy blessing we shall succeed. Remember to protect 
us.* The remains of the halwd are given to black dogs and crows. 

Worship of the Sun also obtains in some septs. The cenotaph of 
an ancestor named Jujhar at Jhanda, in Patidla, is visited for religious 
parposes." 

In Gurgaon and the tracts round that District the Bdurias are divided 
into num(3rous groups. Of these the most important, locally, is the 
JaruldwJlld or Laturi^,* so called because its members wear long hair, 
like Sikhs.t This group is endogamous and includes 14 gots:-^ 

1 Badgujae. 10 GangwilXt 

2 Chauhan.J 11 Jaghotia.§§ 

3 Panwar. 12 Katoria.||||. 

13 Kotia. 

14 Mewatia.

5 Agotia.% 

6 Baghotia.ii 

7 Berara.^f 

8 Chiond .*• 

9 Dabria.ft 



18 Jagonsa 1 ^ 



19 Konja 

These 14 gots are strictly exogamous. "Widow re-marriage (karao) is 
permissible ; but not marriage outside ihe JaruMwdJa group. Even 
marriage with a Rdjput woman, of a khanp from which the Bauriaa 
are sprung, is looked down upon, and the offspring are called suret- 
wdl, as among the Rd-jputs, or taknot. Such children find it difficult 
to obtain mates and, if boys, can only do so by paying heavily for 
their brides. Such men too are only allowed to smoke with pure Bdurias 
after the nari has been removed from the huqqa. 

The addition to (or possibly overlapping) this grouping are a number 
of occupational groups, as follows : — 

I. Sehd,dari^,^^ skilled in entering [sic) the burrows of the seh 
(porcupine) and found in Bhawdni, Hissar District. 

* But see ||l| below. 

t The Banriaa do not appear to become true Sikhs but, probably because many of them 
wear long hair, they are often said to be so. Regarding the Biurias of Lyallpur Mr. J 
M. Dunnett writes : — 

" They are, I find, all Hindus, out-oastea of course, but still wearing the ch.oti and 
bnrning their dead. In one Police station in anticipation of registration (as members of 
a Criminal Tribe) they had become Sikhs, but in no case had the 'pahul been taken before 
orders for registration had been issued. One man thus naively explained that he had all 
the kahkas except the hcichh, and I had really come before he could get that made. In 
their zeal they had even gone the length of wearing a six^h hakka, called Ttanpan, a amall 
Bpade, with which they said the patdsha used in the pahul is stirred." 

X Sub-divided into 8 septs in Lahore, in which District they rank highest, 

§ Of Panwar origin. 

II ? Bighotia, from Bighoto, but they are said to be named from Baghot a village in Nabha 
and to be descended from Jatii Rajputs. 

^ Berara, so called from berar, a mixture of several kinds of grain ; the got is descended 
from a Panwar who married a woman of his own got by karewa. 

** From Chaond, a callage. 

tt From dab, a grass found in the Jumna riverain lands whence they came ; the got 
claims Panwar or even Chauhan origin. 

XX From beyond the Ganges : cf. Gangwalia a group mentioned below. 

§§0f Badgujar origin. 
BHEA 111! The Katorias claim Rathaur extraction. But it is also said that the Baurias who live 
'n Punjab are called JaniUwila or Katoria and wear long hair, like Sikhs. The Biurias 
of the U ted Provinces are styled Bidkias.

2. Telbecha^ dealers in the oil of the pelican and other birds,

3. Bailia, a group which raodesfely claims Jhfwar-KahAr origin, and 
is distinguished by churis (or an iron bangle) worn on the wrist. 

4. Ugarwa, an off-shoot of the Bfigris who live by burglary. 

5. Bhaurjalia (sic) who cse the baur {bdwar) or snare. 

6. Badhak or Badhakia, hunters, found in Bhaxatpur State, 
Mathra, etc. 

7. Chirim^rs, bird-snarers, found in tho same tracts. 
Other groups are territorial, such as the — 

1. DilwAHs, found in Delhi and its neighbourhood. An off-shoot 
of this group is the Ndriwal which sells ropes. 

2. Nagauria, from N^gaur in Jodhpur State. 

3. Bdgfi, from the Bagar of Bikdner. 

4. Marus, from Mdrwdr. 

Other groups of less obvious origin are also found. Suoh are the — 

1. K^ldhablia or Kaldhablia, who wear the black woollen clnak 
(kavxli) and are found in the Pati61a State and to the west of 
Bhiwdni. 

2. Gangwdlia,* found in Jaipur State. 

3. HdburJl, vagrants from the east of the Jumna. 

4. Gandhila, found on any riverain in the Punjab (? proper) and 
also east of the Jumna. 

5. Ahiria, foand in and about llodal and Palwal. According tea 
Brahinan parohit of the Ahirias at Hodal the Bdurias and Ahiriaa 
are descended from Goha, a Bhil, one of whose descendants married 
a Thakur.t Her children by him became Ahirias (Heria or Heri, 
lit. a hunter), while the Bdurias are of pure Bhil blood. Closely 
allifd to the Ahiria are the Badhaks. The Ahiria and Bduria do 
not intermarry. 

The panch, who are chosen from thp four khdnps and the Mewdtia 
group, are regftrded as leaders of the tribe. They form a panchayat 
(or ? a panchayat for each khdnp) for the whole group. Offences 
are tried before ttie panchayat which administers to the offender 
an oath on tho Ganges or tho Jumna : or he is made to advance 
fivo paces towards the sun and invoke its curse if he is guilty : but 
the most binding oath is that taken while plucking the leaf of 
a pi-pal tree. Fines go towards the expenses of the panchayat, and 
any surplus to the panch. Panchdyats also solemnize the marriages of 
widows and the fee then realised is paid to the widow's father-in-law. 
The Bduria sehrhs. 

Tradition avers that when a rdiii of Nimrdna married she was 
accompanied by five families of Rdthaur Baurirts from whom are 
descended the present Rathaur (? Bdurias or) Kdjputs. Hence the 

• Not, apparently, the same as the Gangil got mentioned above, 
t Apparently named Karaul, and founder of the State of Karauli. 



^6 The Bduria cults. 

Rdtliaurs* regard Niinrd/na as their Sehrh and worshio Devi at her 
temple there. The Panwdrs have their sehrh at Kali^na near 
Narnaul : the Badgfijars theirs at Kanaund : and the Chaubans at 
Ranmoth near Mandi>an (?) in Alwar. 

The Dabrias Bpecially affect Musd-ni Devit but the B^urias as a 
whole have no distinctive cults and few special observances. Some 
of them wear the hair long in honour of Masd,ni Devi, k> whom a 
childless man vows that if a child be vouchsafed to him its hair 
shall remain uncut. Some B^urias also wear the patri, an ornament 
shaped like a jugni and made of gold ; in case of sickness prayer is 
offered through {sic) the pa^.v to the pitars, 'ancestors/ and on 
recovery the sufferer has a patri made and wears it round his neck. 
At meal times it is touched and a loaf given in alms in the pitara* 
names. J Another charm is the devi M ddnd, a few grains of corn, 
which are carried on the person and which, like the patri, avert all 
evil. 

The Devi at Nagarkot, Z^hir Pir (Giaga) and Thakurji ( ? Krishna) 
are other favourite deities of the Bd-urias, but the Sun god is also 
propitiated in times of calamity or sickness. Fasts (hart) are kept 
on Sunday in honour of Hhe Sun, and water thrown towards it. The 
janeo is never worn. For some reason not explained an oath on a 
donkey is peculiarly binding. Mr. Williams notes that B^urias are said 
not to ride the donkey and to regard it with peculiar aversion. Oaths 
are also taken on the cow and the pipal tree. 

The Baurias are strict Hindus, refusing to eat anything, even 
ghiy which has been touched by a Muhammadan, though they will drink 
water from a bhishti's skin, but not that kept in his house. Bdurias 
will only eat meat procured by themselves or killed by jhatka. Pork 
they eschew, but not the flesh of the wild pig.§ The nilgai is regarded 
as a cow and never eaten, nor is the flesh of a he-buffalo save by 
the Baurias of Shaikhd,wati in Jaipur. As they are no longer per- 
mitted to possess swords they slaughter goats with the chhuri. 

In Lahore, where the Bd^urias are said to be non-criminal, they have 
a dialect of their own called Ladi. Elsewhere their patois is called 
Lodi and is said to be understood by Bhils, Sdnsis, Kanjars and such 
like tribes. The Bd-wariah dialect is called Ghirhar, and sometimes 
Pashtu. 

* And the Katorias, as being of Rathaur descent. 

I Mr. Williams says : — 'boats are offered to Devi and, at the time of oblation, water is 
sprinkled on the animal's head ; if it shakes its ears the omen is propitious and Devi has 
accepted the sacrifice.' And Mr, Dunnett writes : — " In Lyallpur the worship of a devi is 
admitted by all but the Songira Dharmwat who revere Bhairkiya and Narswer (Nar Singh). 

The devi is worshipped in jungles at the sacred tree. At its roots a square is marked 
out with stones, and in the centre a hole is dug. A he-goat is then slain, and the blood 
poured into the hole, the holy tree and the foreheads of the worshippers being also sprin- 
kled. Over the hole a hearth is then constructed, on which the skuU, the left fore-leg, 
liver, kidneys and fat are burned. The remainder is then cooked on the same hearth, and 
eaten by the worshippers. The ceremonial is of course based on the idea that the god is 
of the brotherhood of the tribe." 

^ ' When anyone is in trouble, the cause is ascribed to his having angered a departed 
spirit, called patar, to appease which some crumbs are fried in oil and put in a brazier, 
before which all those present fold their hands and beat their brows.' (Williams). 

§ Tn some parts the Bauria* will, it is said, cat the flesh of animals which have died a 
uai\u:al death. 



Bduria customs. 7 ' 

Birth observances. — The child's name is chosen by a Brahman. On 
the fifth day after birth the mother takes a lota full of water on her head 
to the nearest well, a Brahmani and Nain, with other women, accompany- 
ing her and binuing songs. She rakes with her hhanjor (moistened grain) 
of gram or hnjra and after worshipping the well throws some of the 
hhanjor, with a little water out of her lota and a makka brought by 
the BrahmHni or Nain into the well. The rest of the bhanjor is 
distributed among children. The motiher is deemed purified on tho 
tenth day. Kathaur children are ttikon to the sehrh at Nimrana to 
have their heads shaved, but the Panwdrs, Chauhdns and Badgujars 
all take theirs to Masani Devi at Gurgaon. 

Wedding rt^es.— Betrothal is not specially initiated by either side, 
but as soon as the negotiations have reached a certain stage the 
girl's father, his Brahman or nai goes with the tika and even the 
poorest man confirms the agreement by presenting a rupee to the boy. 
Well-to-do people give him a camel or gold earrings. 

Biiuria men are, in their youth, sometimes branded. Most of their 
women are tattooed in one or more places on the face, viz., near the 
outer corners of the eyes, at the inner corner of the left eye, on the left 
cheek and on the chin : hence Bauria women are easily recognizable. 

Bdiurias do not marry within their own got, and it is said that the 
bridegroom must not be younger than the bride, and that a blind or 
one-eye'd man must espouse a blind or one-eye'd woman ! In some 
tribes, adds Mr. "Williams, fair women are only married to fair men, 
and the blackskinned, which form the majority, mate with one another. 

The girl's father intimates the date fixed for her wedding by 
sending a ici/ia c/it7^^2 written in Sanskrit, and on tho day fixed the 
wedding party goes to the girl's house. The bridegroom wears the 
aehra and his forehead is smeared with haldi. The ceremonies aro 
all in essence the same as those observed by the Rdjputs, except that 
no khera is named, for the simple reason that the Baurias have no 
fixed abodes. Weddings are, however, not solemnised by sending the 
patka or katdr in lieu of the bridegroom. Bduria brides wear a necklace 
made of horse hair on which aro threaded gold and silver beads. This 
is called sohag sutra and it is worn till the husband's death, when it 
is burnt with his corpse. 

On a man's death his elder and then his younger brother have tho 
first claim to his widow's hand. Failing such near kinsmen a stranger 
may espouse her on payment of pichha, a sum assessed by tho 
panches and paid by the new husband to tho nearest agnate of tho 
deceased's father. 

Co-habitation with a woman of another caste is punished by not 
allowing the offender to smoke with the brotherhood, and the woman is 
regarded as a suret and her children as tmretwdl even though she 
be a pure Rajput by caste. Infidelity on a wife's part is purged away 
by pressing a red hot iron into her tongue.* 



* Mr. Williams' account of the Bdwaria marriage customs is however different and runs 
as follows : — / . . 

"Each tribal sub-division is cndogamous, anc! Ciu:h got exogamous to tho father s po*^ 
Marriage is permitted in the mother's got excludiDg near relations. Blarriage within th 



78 Bduria sport. 

The observances at death differ in no way from those current 
among orthodox Hindus. The bones of the dead are taken to Garh 
Muketsar and there thrown into the Ganges. Mr. Williams however 
writes : — "The dead over seven years of age are burnt among most of 
the tribes, though some, as the Bid^wati, practise burial. The corpse 
of a young: person is draped with fine white cloth, of an old man with 
coarse cloth, and of a woman with turkey red. On the third day after 
a funeral, boiled rice is distributed among young girls. When a 
BAwaria wife is cremated her widower lights the pile. A father per- 
forms the same office for a son, a son for a father, on failing such 
relationship, any near relative. On the third day following, the ashes 
are collected and rice is laid on seven pipal leaves and placed at the foot 
of the tree, certain persons being told to watch from a distance. If a 
crow eats the rice, it is a good omen ; but bad if a dog devours it. The 
period of mounrnig lasts twelve days. The ceremony of shrddh is per- 
formed in Assu, when rice is given to crows, the idea being to supply 
the necessities of the deceased in another world." 

Sporting Propensities. — A distinguishing feature of this people is 
their shikarring: proclivities. In all parts of the Province they have 
dogs, large meshed nets for catching jackals and other vermin, and 
thong nooses for antelope. Where jungle is thick and game plentiful, 
sport sometimes takes the form of slaughter. Game is gradually 
driven into an enclosure formed by two lines of stakes, several feet 
apart, each tipped with a coloured rag and forming an angle at the 
apex of which are planted in several parallel rows the little bamboo 
stakes with slip knot thongs, looking in the distance like a patch of dry 
grass. The third side of the triangle is formed by the B^warias with 
dog and torn toms. When the beat begins, the line of beaters advances 

prohibited degrees of consanguinity is punished with excommunication up to a period of 12 
years, as among the Kuchband and other cognate tribes. The higher gots in the social scale 
are the Solkhi, or Sulankhi, Panwar, Choh4n, Bh4ti, and Sankhla, and hence intermarriage 
■with them is sought after for the sake of their blue blood. 

Marriage and betrothal occur when both sexes have arrived at adult age. Sons may 
remain immarried without incurring odiiun ; but, in the case of daughters, the panchdyat 
interferes and penalties are inflicted if too much time is allowed to pass. 

The ceremonies at betrothal — sdk or mangani — are simple. An emissary of the suitor 
meets, by appointment, the girl's relatives and hands a sum ranging from Rs. 5 to 9 to the 
senior male relative present, who pays the amoimt to the girl's father. The suitor is then 
invited, if acceptable, to the evening meal, when the contract is made. An interval then 
passes before tlie date of mariage is fixed, previous to which the girl's paternal imcle visits 
the suitor and gives him a rupee. Seven days before the wedding, the same relative 
presents himself and ties black cotton tags round the youth's ankles. 

Marriage is always by fhera, as among tribes of the same category . On the day ap- 
pointed, four wooden pegs, a span long, are driven into the ground forming a square, a fire 
lit in the centre and cotton seed steeped in oU placed over it. A square copper coin (mansuri 
faim) is put on the top of each peg. The couple circle seven times round the fire with a 
knot tied in their garments, and the ceremony ends. A Brahman is usually present and 
receives a donation of Rs. 2 to 5, Rs. 24 to 100, according to the status of the parties, is 
paid to the bride's parents, who prepare an outfit of cooking utensils and clothing, and 
return some of the rupees in a thdli, or brass vessel. The home-coming, or mukldwa 
ceremony comes last and consists in the bride's being sent to her husband's house with a 
gift of a chadnr from her parents. 

Marriage by karewa is permitted and is the only form permissible to widows. It is 
availed of when a woman is destitute, or has no parents. A surviving brother is required 
to marry the widow, and, in default, she may claim compensation through a pnnchdyat. 
When a widow marries, bracelets of lacquer are put on her and a fine of Rs. 5 imposed. A 
woman convicted of adultery is disgraced and her chadar torn, the male accomplice being 
fined from Rs. 2 to 4 by the panchdyat"

with great noise and howling, causing the game to gallop away until the 
line of stakes is reached, when scared by the coloured rags the animals 
glaoce aside and speed towards the apex, where a clear space appears 
with no visible obstacle hut some tufts of familiar grass. In attemptino- 
to clear these, some antelope are caught in the thongs and thrown

Bawa, fern. Bawi (1), a title given to the male descendants of the first three 
Gurus of the Sikhs ; (2) a. fakir or sddhic; the head of an order of 
monks.

Bazaz, (1) a cloth-dealer; (2) a section of the Aroras. 

Bazid Khel, a section of the Jawaki Afridis found in Baizai, Kohdt. 

Baziqar, /r. Pers. bdzi, ' play.' The Bdzigar is usually a Muhammadan 
the Nat a Hindu. Among the Bdzigar both sexes perform, but 
among Nats only the males. Some say the B^zigar is a tumbler and 
the Nat a rope-dancer, others that the former is a juggler and also an 
acrobat, the latter an acrobat only. In the Eastern Punjab the 
B^zigar is termed Bddi. See Nat. 

In Ferozepur the Bdzigars have a shrine at Sadhaiwala, built in 
honour of an old woman who died not many years ago. Liquor is 
poured into a cup-shaped hole in this tomb and drunk. Weddings 
in families which affect this shrine are generally solemnised there. 
They have a Kd,ja, and his wife is H^ni. Both settle disputes without 
appeal and are almost worshipped, the latter being attended by a 
number of women who carry her long train. Bdzigar camps consist 
of reed huts pitched in regular lines. The 'caste' is said to be 
recruited from various castes, even Brahmans and Jats, but each 
sub-division is endogamous. The Bdzigara are in fact only an occupation- 
al group. 

Bed,* a section of the Muhidls. 

BEDA,t (1) a musician caste inLad^kh : see Ind. Art. 1901, p. 330 ; (2) the

Be-nawa (?ba-nawa) (1) a doubtful syn. for he-shara: (2)— or Bd-nawd,* 
according^ to Mr. Maclagan one of the most prominent of the 
Be-sliara or unorthodox orders of IsMm, and said to be followers of one 
Khwdja Hasan Basri. The term is sometimes apparently applied in 
a loose manner to Qddiri and Chishti faqirs, but it is properly applicable 
only to a very inferior set of beggars — men who wear patched garments 
and live apart. They will beg for anything except food, and in 
begging they will use the strongest language ; and the stronger the 
language, the more pleased are the persons from whom they beg. Many 
of the offensive names borne by villages in the Gujrdnwala District 
are attributed to mendicants of this order, who have been denied 
an alms. The proper course is to meet a Be-nawd beggar with gibes 
and put him on his mettle ; for he prides himself on his power of 
repartee, and every Be-nawd wears a thong of leather which he has to 
unloose when beaten in reply, and it is a source of great shame for him 
to unloose this thong [tasma khol dend). The Be-nawds appear to be rare 
in the west of the Punjab, and those in our returns are mainly from 
Karnal, Julluudur, LudhidiUa and Hoshi^rpur. 

Bkeag, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Be-shara, a term applied to the irregular or unorthodox orders of laMm 
whose followers, while calling themselves Musalm^ns, do not accom- 
modate their lives to the principles of any religious creed : c/. dzdd. 
The Be-shara orders include the Be-nawd, Gurzmar, Maddri and Rasul- 
shdhis. 

Beskd, s.m. (K.), the watchman of harvested grain. 

Beta (incorrectly BATiA),a small outcaste group found in Spiti, correspond- 
ing to the Hesis of Kuliu. They live by begging, making whips for 
the men and bracelets of shell for the wot&en, arfd attending weddings 
as musicians along with the blacksmiths. Blacksmiths do not eat with 
them or take their women as wives. Merely to drink water out of an- 
other man's vessel conveys no pollution in Spiti, and in the higher parts 
of the Spiti valley the hookah is also common to all : while in the lower 
parts Hesis are merely required to smoke from the bowl of the common 
pipe through a stem provided by themselves.

Bhabra, fem.Bhdbri,a caste of the Jainis, chiefly engaged in trade. The term 
Bhd,br4 appears to be of great antiquity, being found in an inscription of 
Asoka. The name is now fancifully derived from Bhaobhala, * one of 
good intent,'t but in Jullundur the Bliabr^s attribute their name to 
their refusal to wear the janeo at the instance of one Bir Sw^mi, who 
thereupon declared that their faith (bhu) was great. The term BMbra 
however appears to be used by outsiders of any Bani^s, especially of 
the Oswals and ochers whose home is in Rajputd.na, whether they

are Jains by religion or not. This would appear to be the casein 
Rawalpindi, an'l in Siisa the Sikh immigrants from Paliala certainly 
call the Oswal B^nias Bhabras. 

The Bhdbrds of Hoshidrpur are an interesting community. As 
a caste they have two groups, each comprising various gots or als, 
viz. : — 

Group I. — Oswals. 
Gots. 



Bhabhii. 

Nahar. 

Gadhia. 

Mahmia.

The Osw^l came originally from Osia in Jaipur, the Khanderw^l from 
Khandela in Jodhpur. As to the origin of the got names, Mahmia or 
Maimia is derived from Mahm, the Down in Rohtak, and was originally 
called Dhariwal. Seoni (which occurs in both the gcoups) is a Khatri 
clan. The Liga (who perform the first tonsure, or mimdan, at home) 
came from Sultd-npur, in Kapurthala : the Tandw^i, of Tanda (? in 
Hosbiarpur) are an al of the Bhabhus, formed only a 100 years ago and 
not yet a got. The Nahar or ' lions ' once drank the milk of a lioness 
and hail from Jaipur. The Gadhia are called Churria in R^jputdoa. 
Most Bhabras cut their boys' hair for the first time at Dadi Kothi (now 
called Kangar Kothi), their temple near Jaijon. Most of the Hoshid-rpup 
Bhd,br^s are Oswals, of the Bhabhu and Nahar, those of Balachaur being 
Gadhia and Naha.r by got. Some Bhabras respect Brahmans and employ 
them on social occasions, at weddings and funerals, and for the shradhs, 
though the Jain tenets forbid the shrddh observances. The Khanderwals 
alone appear to wear the janeo. In Jind the Jains are said to be 
recruited, from the Aggarwal,* Oswal, Srimal, and Khandelwal Bdnias, 
but the last three are also styled Bhabrds— whether Jains or not. 
Jain Aggarwdls are said to intermarry with the Yaishnava Aggarwals 
in that vState but not in Karndl. Another account from Jind states 
that the Oswdl are bisa, i. e., of pure descent, while the Srimal are only 
dasa, i. e.,t of impure descent, and that these two groups do not in- 
termarry. The Oswal are also stated to avoid only the paternal got 



* An account of rather doubtful authority makes the Oswals and Khandelwala only 
' Bbaos,' the Bagri form of hhd{, ' brother ' — and derives Bhdbra from bhdo — because 
Parasnath was an Oswal of the ruling family of Osnagar. It makea the Aggarwalaa 
Saraogis, i.e., sikha or disciplea. Each group ia said to be endogamoua, i. c, Bhabfia do 
not intermarry with Sar^ogia. 

t Another account says that both Oswil and Srimal contaia hisa and dasa claases, the 
dasa being in a minority in both groups-

in marriage, while tlie Srimal observe the ionx-got rule. On the other 
hand the BMbras of Nabha are said to have two sub-castes : Oswd,l, who 
observe the four-grot rule, and Kundewal (? Khandelwd,!), who avoid only 
the paternal got in marriage.* And again in Maler Kotla the * Bh^br^s 
or Oswd,ls ' are said to avoid two gois. The Jain Bhdbrd,s are strictly 
monogamous, a second wife not being permitted during the life-time of 
the first under any circumstances. t For further information regarding 
the Aggarwdl, Oswal, etc., see Bania, and for the Jain sectarian 
divisions see Jain. 

Bhachar, a Khokhar clan (agricultural) found in ^hahpur. 

Bhadah, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multd,n, 

Bhaddar, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

Bfadiar, a tribe of Jats, in Sid^lkot, which claims Solar Rajput origin and 
is descended from its eponym. Atu, 7th in descent from him, 
came from Ajudhia and took service under the R.ajas of Jammu. 

Bhadko, an Arain clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar and Montgomery. 

Bhagar, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

Bhagat Bhagwan. See under Udasi. 

Bhagat, an agricultural clan found in Shahpur. 

Bhagat-panthi. — A sect of the Nanak-panthis which appears to be quite 
distinct from the Bhagtis or followers of Bdba Suraj of Chd,ha Bhagtdi 
in the Kahiita tahsil of Rawalpindi. It is found in the Bannu District, 
in Pah^rpur, and in tahsil Dera Ismail Khan. Though they reverence 
the Granth, the Nanak-panthis observe the usual Hindu ceremonies at 
marriao-e or death, but the Bhagat-panthis do not. They take the 
Granth to their houses, and read certain portions of it at weddings. 
Marriage and betrothal ceremonies may be performed at a dharmsdla, 
or the marriage may be celebrated by taking the Granth to the house 
and there reciting portions of it. No funeral rites are performed and 
the dead are buried, not burnt. Passages from the Granth are read 
for a few days after the death. And on occasions of marriage or death 
Jcardh imrshdd is distributed. There is no rule of chhiit or * touch,' 
forbidding contact with other castes. The sect makes no pilgrimages, 
avoids idolatry, and performs no shrddh for the dead. Daily worship 
is an essential duty and consists in recitations of the Granth at six 
stated hours of the day, viz., before sunrise, before noon, afternoon, 
before sunset, in the evening and at night. At worship they sit down 
eight times, rising eight times and making eight prostrations. This 
sect thus strives after pure Sikhism and freedom from Brahminical 
supremacy. 

Bhaggo, a sub-division of Jats. 

Bhagti, a Gosain sub-sect or order, said to have been founded by Kanshi 
Ram, a brother of Saindas. The latter was a Brahman Bairdgi whose 
son Ramdnand has a shrine, well-known in and about the Gujrd,nwal^ 
District, at Baddoke. His sect has many followers among the more 
respectable Khatris and Brahmans of Lahore and its neighbourhood. 

* Till recently the Oswal of the Punjab avoided two gots in marriage, and the Dhundias 
among them still do so, but in 1908 a great asseciblage of the Pujeias resolved that only 
the paternal gob need be avoided. 

+ This is however said to be merely a counsel of perfection.

Bhakral, one of the group of tribes whicl/ hold considerable areas in 
the soutli-east of the Rtlwalpindi District. The Hliakral are also found 
in some numbers in Jhelura and Gujrat. Like the Budhal they 
probably came from the Jammu territory across the Jfielum. They do 
not approve oF widow marriage. A laige number of the tribe also 
return themselves as Pun war in Hi1,wal()indi, and the tribe may be 
classed as Hajput. 

Bhakri; a Sayyid clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery.

Bhaman, a Jilt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhamrai, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhamye, a Gujar clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhand, Bhand. — The Bhand or Naqqd,l is the story-teller, joker, and 
buSoon, and is often also called Bd^sha. The name comes from the 
Hindi bhdnda "buffooning.^' He is separate from, and of a lower 
professional status than, the Bahrupia. Beth are commonly kept by 
Rajds* and other wealthy men like the jester of the early English 
noble, but both also wander about the couutry and perform to street 
audiences. The Bhd,nd is not a tiue caste any more than the 
Bahrupia, and is probably often a Miidsi by caste. Elliott seems to 
imply that Bahrupia is a caste and Bhd,nil an occupation j but the 
former statement is certainly not true in the Punjab. 

Bhandar, a J^t clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhandela, a minor caste found in Sirmur, and cn'respouding to the 
Sikligar of the plains. 'J'hey appear to have come from Marw^r in the 
Mughal times and retain their peculiar speech and intonation. Sikhs 
by religion, they are dealers in arms, etc , by occupation, and are said 
to be much given to crime. 

Bhander, a Jat clan (agricultural) foun 1 in Amritsar. 

Bhanggi, fern. Bhanggan (also a woman who drinks bhang). A man of the 
sweeper caste : also a man belonging to the Bhanggi misl. 

Bhangqia, fern. Bhanggeban, a dealer in bhang. 

Bhango, a tribe of Jd,ts found in Sialkot which claims Solar Riijput 
ancestry and is descended from its eponym, who came from Nepal. 
Also found in Amritsar (agricultural) ; and in Montgomery as a Hindu 
Jclt clan (agricultural). 

* Kadeh Bhand, known as Kidir Bakhsh. was a famous Bhand, who peed to go frcpi 
one court to another. The Maharaja of Pati^la gave him a village. 



84 Bhangu-^Bhardi. 

BnANGtJ, Bliang^ij,* a J^t tribe which does not claim Rdjput origin. The 
Bhangu and Nol were among the earliest inhabitants of the Jhang 
District and held the country about Shorkot, the Nol holding that 
round Jhang itself before the advent of the Sid,ls, by whom both tribes 
were overthrown. Probably the same as the Bhango, supra. 

Bhaniwal, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhanjra, a synonym for Dumna in the lower hills of Hoshidrpnr and 
Gurddspur. He makes sieves, winnowing fans and other articles 
of grass and bamboo. Like the Sansois, Sarials and Daolis, the 
Bhanjr^s may be regarded as an occupational group cf the Dumnds, with 
whom they intermarry. 

Bhanot, a Rajput clan which occupies a hdrah or 12 villages immediately 
north of Garhshankar round Padrawa, S^lempur and Posi. The 
name is fancifully derived from Imi, because they once dwelt in the 
hanot or shadow of the ha7i or forests of the Siwdliks, and they are 
said to have come from Bhatpur, a village close to that range not 
now held by them. They appear to have been an al of the Ndrua. 

Bhaneanaye, a Gujar clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhanrae, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bhanwala, a small J^t clan in Jind, whose jather a is a Gosain. 

BhAo, a sept of Raorhbansi Rajputs, found in Gujrat, immigrants from 
Ajudhia into Jammu and thence into the Gujrd.t sub-montane. 
The name, which perhaps suggests a Rdjputana origin, is said to be 
derived from the fear (bhao) which the tribe inspired : but others 
say the Bhao were free-booters and hence earned the title. 

The Bhao rank high, and they, the Manhas and Jural, greet one 
another ' Jai deo. ' They also intei marry with the Chibhs of Kadhdle 
and Ambariala; but not with the rest of that tribe, owing to an 
ancient feud. The first tonsure is performed at Kilit, a place in 
Samrdla, in Jammu territory. 

Bhar, a Jd.t clan (agricultural) found in Multd,n. 

Bhaeah, Bhaeah, two Jat clans (agricultural) found in Multd,n : (possibly 
one and the same). 

Bhaeais— The Bhardis who are scattered throughout these Provinces are 
also known as Pirhain,t a name which is explained thus: — 

(i) One Bukan Jdt was a devotee of Sakhi Sarwar who one day said 
to him twjhe piri di, *the saint's mouth has fallen on thee,^ whence 
the name Pirhai. 

(m) Another account says that after leaving Dhaunkal, Sakhi Say y id 
Ahmad went to Multdn and rested for a while at Parahin, a place 
south of Shd,hkot, which was the home of his mother's ancestors, 
Rihan Jdts by caste. At Multan an Afghan chief had a daughter to 
whose hand many of the Shiihkot youths aspired, but none were deemed

worthy. One day, however, the Afghdn invited Sayyid Ahmad to a 
feast and begged hira to accept his daughter in marriage. This offer 
the saint accepted, and the sihra below, wliich wrs composed on this 
occasion, is still sung wirh great reverence. The mirdsi, however, 
neglected to attend the wedding punctually, and when he did appear, 
rejected the saint's present of a piece of blue cloth, 1^ yards in 
length, at the instigation of the Jjits and Pathans, saying it was of no 
use to him. Hearing this the , Sayyid gave it to Shaikh Buddha, a 
Jdt who had been brought up with him, saying : "This is a bindi 
(badge), tie it round your head, and beat a drum. We need no 
mirdsi, and when yon are in any difficulty remember me in these 
words : — Daimji Rabdia saicdria, bohar Kali Kakki-wdlia — Help me 
in time of trouble, thou owner of Kd,li Kakki ! You and your 
descendants have come under cur protection, pandh, and you shall be 
called ijandhi.^' This term became corrupted into Parahin in time. 
Thus the account contradicts itself, as the name is said to be derived 
from Parahin, a place. 

The term Bhar^i itself is usually derived from chauhi bharnd, lit. 
'to keep a vigil,' in which are sung praises of the Sakhi. But another 
and less simple account says that owing to his marriage Sayyid 
Ahmad incurred the enmity of the Jdts and Pathd,ns of Shdhkot and 
left that place for Afghauistd,n, accompanied by Bibi Bai, Rd,nd, Mian, 
and his younger brother. Twenty-five miles from Dera Ghazi Khd,n 
they halted. No water was to be found, so the Sayyid mounted 
his mare Kali Kakki and at every step she took water came up. His 
pursuers, however, were close at hand, and when they overtook him 
the Sakhi was slain, and buried where he fell. The spot is known as 
Nigaha and still abounds in springs. 

Years after Isa, a merchant of Bokhara, and a devotee of Sakhi 
Sarwar, was voyaging in the Indian Ocean Avhen a storm arose. Isd 
invoked the saint's aid and saved the ship. On landing he journeyed 
to Multdn where he learnt that the saint had been killed. On reaching 
Nigd/ha he found no traces of his tomb, but no fire could be kindled 
on the spot, and in the morning as they loaded the camels their legs 
broke. Sakhi Sarwar descended from the hill on his mare, holding 
a spear in his hand, and warned the merchant that he had desecrated 
his tomb and must rebuild it at a cost of 1^ lakhs. He was then to 
bring a blind man, a leper, and an eunuch"^ from Bokhdra and 
entrust its supervision to them. One day when the blind man stumbled 
near the tomb he saved himself by clutching at some kahi grass where- 
upon his sight was restored and his descendants are still known as the 
Kahi. 'I'he eunuch was also cured and his descendants are called 
Shaikh. The leper too recovered, and his descendants, the Kalang, are 
still found in Nigahii. To commemorate their cures all three beat a 
drum, and Sakhi Sarwar appeared to them, saying ; *' He who is my 
follower will ever beat the drum and remain barahi,f ' sound,' nor 
will he ever lack anything." Hence the pilgrims to Nigdhd became 
known as Bhardin.

86 Bhardi — Bharhhunja. 

Strictly speaking the Bliarais do not form a caste, but an occu- 
pational group or spiritual brotherhood which comprises men of many 
castes, Dogar, Habri, Uawat, Dum, Rajput, Mochi, Gujar, Tarkhdn 
and last, but not least, Jdt. They belong to the Muhammadan religion, 
but in marriage they follow the Hindu customs. Thus a Jd,t Bhar^i 
may only uiarry a Jat woman, and in Kangra, it is said, she too 
must be a Bhardi. In Ambfila, however, a Bharai may marry 
any Jdtni, and in Kapurthala it is said that, being Muhammadans, 
marriao-e within the got is permitted, and tliat; Hd,jput Bliarais 
may take wives from Jilt Bhaidis. There appears indeed to be no 
absolute or even general rule, but the tendency apparently is for the 
Bhardis recruited from any one caste to form a separat'^ caste of 
Bharais, marrying only in that caste, e.g., in Ludhidna the Jdt Bhardi 
only marries a Bhar^i Jdtni, and the gots avoided are the same as 
among the Jdts. The Jdt Bhardis are numerous. They claim descent 
from one Gdrba Jat, a Hindu attendant at Saklii Sarwar's shrine, who 
was in a dream bidden by the saint to embrace Isldm. On conversion 
he was called Shaikh Gdrba. The Jdt Bhardis have several gots: — 
Dhillon, Deo, Rewal Garewdl, Mdn, Randhdwa, J ham, Karhi and 
Badecha. 

Marriage Doicer. — The amount of mehr, given according to Muham- 
madan Law to the wife by the husbar.d, never exceeds Hs. 32-6 ; while 
the minimum dowry given to the bride by her father consists of Rs. 21 
in cash and 5 copper vessels. 

Insignia. — The Bhardi's insignia are a driun {dliol), beaten with a 
curiously-shaped stick, like a short crook ; a wallet {khallar) hung 
round the neok by a string. The stick and khallar are peculiar to the 
Hhardis. The standard of the Pirhais is a fringe [jagddhri) of tassels 
on a long pole. These fringes are presented by women as thank- 
offerings for the birth of sons and at weddings. They are supposed 
to be tied round the forehead of the saint as they would be tied on a 
bridegroom's forehead. 

Food. — It is f^aid that in many places Bhardis eat only goat's flesh, 
and that leprosy would aflflict him who ate any other kind of flesh. 
But this restriction is certainly not universal. Beef is avoided, because, 
it is said, the Bhardis have many Hindu votaries. 

Bharal, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Bbaranch, a smallJat clan in Jind who have the same Sidh as the Kale

Bhafhhunija groups. 87 

As the gots are so few, only one got is avoided in marriage, but the 
caste is said to be strictly endogamous in Pati^la, and outsiders'aro 
never admitted into t)ie caste. 

By religion Bharbliunjas are both Hindus and Muhanimndans. Like 
other Hindus the former invoke Sada 8hiva when commencing work, 
as the shop is regarded as his thard (platform). Subha.i, another 
deota, is also worshipped at weddings, sherbet and some copper pice 
being offered him, tmd cooked food distributed in liis name. 

A Bharbhunja wife may not wear glass bangles or blue clothes or a 
nose-ring {lauvg). 

Bharbliunjas only make harts at weddings; and only eat food 
cooked by Brahinans. They wear the janeo, but permit karewa, the 
husband's brother's claims being recognised. /I'hey preserve an old 
system of local jianchdyats, with hereditary chaudhris, in which all 
caste disputes are settled. At weddings, etc., the chaudhri gives the 
lag and receives li shares in the hhaji. Bharbhunjas mostly pursue 
their creed and calling, but some take to service. In appearance they 
are dark and under-sized. 

In the N^bha State the Bharbhunjas have two occupational groups, 
the Dhankuta or " rice-huskers " (from dhdn, ricp, and kutnd) and 
the Malld,hs or boatmen. Thesp two groups do not intermarry, or drink 
togefclier, but they smoke from the same hxiqah with a different mouth- 
piece. The Malldhs use a large spoon, the Dhankutas a sharp crooked 
instrument, in parching gram. Both groups are found in the Bd,vval 
Niz^mat of this State. In the Phul and Amloh Nizdmats the Kd,yasths, 
a sub-group of the former, claim origin from tliat caste, audit is said : — 
Pa^hgiya jo Kdyastha, ivarnd bhatti jhokan Id'iq : 'He who acquires 
knowledge is a Kayastha, otherwise he is only fit to parch grain.' Hence 
many Kayasths have joined the Bharbhunja caste. In Bd,wal the 
Bharbhunja gots are named from the place of origin, e.g., Mandauria, 
from Mandaur in Alwar, and Chhatagia from Chh^tag. Elsewhere their 
gots are JMu-bansi, Cbandar-bansi, (claiming l^djput origin) Bhatnagar 
and Chandan Katar, and of these the Bhatnagar again suggests 
Kdyasth affinities. The caste is endogamous, and four gots are 
avoided in marriage, but widow marriage is said to be only allowed 
in Bawal. Jats, Gujars and Ahirs take water from a Bharbhunja's 
hands, but Bdnias, Khatris and Brahmans will only take fresh water 
brought by him, not from one of his vessels. The gurus of the 
Bharbhunjas are always Brahmans and perform the phera. Their 
women wear no nose-ring, its use having been prohibited by a sati 
in each group. The Bharbhunjas of Baiwal affect the cult of Bhairon, 
to whom the Mallahs of Agra used to marry their daughters. Tradition 
says that the god once saved a boat from sinking and thenceforward 
the family married one of their girls to the god and left her at his 
shrine where she survived for less than a year. But now only a doll 
of dough is formally married to the god. Other Bharbhunjas also 
reverence Bhairon, and their guru is Subh^n Sahib, whose shrine is 
in a town to the east. He is worshipped on the hhdi duj dnj in Katik. 
The Bbarbhunjas of Phul and Amloh have a pecuhar form of be- 
trothal contract. The bride's father goes to the bridegroom's and 
gives him 4 Mansuri pice, and the latter gives him twice as much in 



^S JBharech — Bhargava Dhusar. 

return. This is called paua hatdnd or exchange of presents, and the 
contract is then said to be irrevocable. If any one violates it without 
reasonable cause he is excomiDunicated by the chaudhris, but may be 
re-adtnitted on payment of a fine which is spent for the benefit of the 
brotherhood. All the Bharbhunjas, except those of Bdwal, wear the 
janeo. If a traveller or a wedding party of Bharbhunjas halts in any 
village the Bharbhunjas there are bound to entertain the whole party, 
otherwise they are excommunicated.'^ 

The Bharbhunja in Delhi claim to be Jaiswdl Edjputs, and have three 
gots, Jaiswil (the highest), Kherwii and Td,jupuria, which all intermarry 
and smoke and eat togethei'. Each village has a chaudhri and of 
two chaudhris one is called chaukrdt. The chaudhri can only act with 
the advice of t\vQvanchdyat. Each chaukrdt has what is called the 
* half pagrl ' and each chaudhri the ' full pagrL' The chaudhri has 
jurisdiction over petty disputes within the caste. Fines ranging from 
Re. 1 to Rs. 100 are levied and the smaller sums spent on feast, 
while larger fines are expended on such public objects as guest-houses. 
Each chaudhri and chaukrdt gets double hhdji at weddings. 

Bhakech, (Barech more correctly), one of the branches of the Pathans. 

From it was descended the family of the Naw^bs of Jhajjar which was 

called Bahidurwati after the name of Bahadur Khan, one of its members. 

The State of Bah^dargarh (Dadri) also belonged' to this family. 
Bharera, a term said to mean silver-smith, in the Simla Hills. The 

Bliareras intermarry with the Lohdrs. 
Bhaegava DeusAR, Dhunsar, a sub-division of the Gaur Brahmans, now 

mainly employed in trade or as clerks. They give themselves the 

following pedigree : —

All the descendants of Bhrigu and Chiman were called Chimanbansi 
Bhargavas, and as Chiman the rishi used to perform his devotions at 
the hill of Arahak, near Rowdri in Gurgaon, which is now called Dhosi, 
those of his descendants who settled in that locality became known as 
Dhusars. Chiman rishihsis an ancient temple on this hill and a new 
one was built in recent years. Adjoining these temples is a tank, the 
Chandrakup. The Dhijsars have the following seven groups or gotras : — 



* Popular legend distorts this descent in a curious way. It says that once Chaman, a 
Brahman of Narnaul, took as his mistress a woman of menial caste, who bore him 7 sons and 
as many daughters. When asked to marry them he bade them appear on an amdAvaa with 
a cow and made each touch its different parts : so one touched its tail {puchal) and foimded 
the Puchalar gotra ; another its horns {sing) and founded the Singlas gofra, and soon. Each 
gotra has five panvaras, except the Kashib which has three or occasionally seven. The Kashibs 
are thus known as triparwaras or saptparwaras and the other gotras as p'^^ichpanvaras. 



Bhargava Dkusar history. 



89 




The Dhusars affect the Yaj-ur Veda, the Mad3'andaDi sakha and the Katj'ani sutraj and 
invariably wear the sacred thread. Only the Brahma form of marriage is tolerated among 
them and in the choice of a bride the ffotra and worshippers of the same kulJevi (family 
goddess) are avoided. Widows never remarry. 

The Bhargava Dhusars claim to have given a long list of parohits and ministers to Hindu 
kings, from Chanda Bhargava who officiated at the sarp yng or serpent sacrifice originated by 
Rfija JamaijayatoHemu Shah, the Baqqal of Rewari, who revolted against Akbar, as the

[Fagan—Hissar Gazetteer, pp. 124, 127—129.] 

Bhatia. — A caste originally from the country round Delhi but more recently 

from Bhatner and the Rajputana desert, and claiming tobeRdjputs 

of Yadubansi race, one branch of which became rulers of Jaisalmir 

■while the other took to commercial pursuits. The name would seem 

to show that they were Bhatis (Bhatti in the Punjab) ; but be that 

as it may, their Rajput origin seems to be unquestioned. They are 

numerous in Sind and Guzerat where they appear to form the leading 

mercantile element, and to hold the place which the Aroras occupy 

higher up the Indus. They have spread into the Punjab along the 

lower vallpys of the Indus and Sutlej, and up the whole length of the 

Cliendb as high as its debouchure into the plains, being indeed most 

numerous in tSialk't and Gujrdt. In these Provinces however they 

occupy an inferior position, both in a social and in a mercantile sense. 

They stand distinctly below the Khatri and perhaps below the Arora, 

and are for the most part engaged in petty shop-keeping, though the 

Bhatias of Dera Isma'il Khan are described as belonging to a ' widely 

spread and enterpj-ising mercantile community.' They are often 

supposed to be Khatris, are very strict Hindus — iar more so than the 

other trading classes of the Western Punj5,b-~eschewing meat and 

liquor. They do not practise widow-marriage.

The Bhdtia sections.

The BMtia caste has 84* sections, called wwA;/i5, divided into two 
groups thus — 



Grodp I. — Bari-

10. Kandal. 

11. Ghanghal. 

12. Kore. 



Both Bald,ha and Jdwa claim to be chdrghar. All the above sections 
are of Bardghar status. It is hardly necessary to explain that 
dhdighar may not give daughters to any but dhdighar, though they may 
take from chdrghar and so on. A breach of this rule involves degrad- 
ation and hence the same section may be both dhdighar and chdrghar. 

Group II. — Bunjahi, which comprises the remaining sectionsf such 
as Baila, Chotd,k, Dholia and Naida. 

There are no territorial groups, but the orthodox idea among the 
old men is that daughters should be given to the Western Bhatids 
of Shd,hpur, Jhelum and Dera Isma'il Khan as they are of superior 
status to those in Gujrdt, while the Eastern Bhatiiis of Sidlkot and 
Gujrdnwdla are considered inferior and wives are taken from them. 

It should, however, be noted that in Bahdwalpur these groups 

appear to be unknown, but of the 
wSk sections given in the margin the 

RaSha. Sijwala is the highest and the Rilla 

Challhar. the lowest. The Bhdtids have a 

Jilla. proverb ' dhan di wadi ai ' or 

^ ••''• ' wealth is greatness.' In Bahawal- 

pur, they live in large rectangular hawelis, each comprising 30 or 40 
houses.

descent and originated in Ajudhia whence its eponym migrated to 
Amritsnr, where it is also found as a Jat (agricultural) clan. 

BHAT9.A. — Like the Mani^r, Banjdra and others the Bhdtrd, is a pedlar. 
He claims Brahman origin, and his traditions say that one Mddho 
Mai, a Brahman rishi, a singer and a poet, once loved and wedded 
Kd,m Kundala, a dancing gii-1. From this pair are descended the 
Madhwas or Bhdtras.* The latter word appears to be a diminutive 
of the Sanskrit bhatta, a bard. However this may be, a curious 
legend accounts for the Bh4trd,s' location in the Punidb and their 
conversion to Sikhism. Madho was born and died in Ceylon,T but 
in the reign of Babar, GuriJ N^nak visited that island, and there 
made a disciple of Changa Bha^ra, a descendant of Mddho. The 
Adi Granth records that 20 maunds of salt a day were required for 
Changa's numerous followers, many of whom were converted to 
Sikhism and followed Guru Nd,nak back to India. 

The M^dhwd,'', however, did not at first settle in the Punjab. 
Originally they were to be found chiefly in the Dadra Dos, along 
the banks of the Ganges in the Bijnor District of the United 
•Provinces, whero many of them are hanjdras or pedlars by trade, 
some hawking cheap ornamButs for women, others so-called Vedic 
medicines.! Thence they migrated into Hoshi^rpur and Si4lkot, but 

♦ This tradition is said to be preserved in the Mahabharata and Singh 4 san Batisi. In a 
j)ttri/;a7ia of Mahi^rnja Ranji't Singh of 7th Asauj, 1866 Sambat, and now in the possession 
of a Bhatra of Dhariwil, the Madhwas w^ere exempted from the grazing tax. 

t A Sikh temple, known as Dera Baba, was built in Ceylon to the Guru's memory at the 
Madhw4s' original home.

(though children under 12 have their heads shaved) and here they 
pose as magicians, foretelling the future by gazing into a cup of oil. 
Thence they mainly frequent the K^ngra District. In Sialkot a moiety 
are true Sikhs, obssrving all the Sikh customs, and often posing as 
gurus, Akd^lis or Nihangs when on their wanderings.* They prey on the 
credulity of the people by astrology. The other moiety are jatadhdris, 
but smoke, and generally assume the characteristic garb of the 
Udasis, pretending to be emissaries of certain temples and col- 
lecting subscriptions for them. After the Diwdli the Bhdtrds set 
out on their tours, returning at the commencement of the rainy 
season. They travel in gangs generally of half-a-dozen or so, and 
the Sikhs are occasionally accompanied by their wives and 
daughters, for whose marriages they collect subscriptions. Various 
forms of swindling are practised by them and they earn large 
sums which they promptly squander on drink and gambling. 
Besides hawking small hardware for sale they pierce children's noses 
and ears for rings,t Hke the Ramdiya of the eastern districts. 

The Bhdtrds' claim to Brahminical origin is borne out by the fact 
that they wear the janeo and tilak, and even at eclipses receive 
certain offerings, while standing in water, from each and every caste. 
They also practise palmistry {rekha). Other castes call them harar- 
popo or Thags, and the higher Brahman groups disown them. 
Probably they are a branch of the Pakauts. 

The Bhdtras have 22 gots, of which 13 are found in Sialkot, viz. ;— 

Bhains. Gaml. Kasba. Lohi. 

Bhattf. Gojra. Lande. Rithor. 

Bhotiwil. Kag. Lar, Rod. 

Digwa. 
Bhatt, fem. Bhatten, Bhattni, Bhdtni, Bhatani : dim. Bhatetd, : fem. 
Bhateti, the son or daughter of a Bhatt : also, contemptuously, any 
one of that caste. The Panid,bi form is Bhatt, but it is very commonly 
pronounced Bh^, especially in the Hills. 

The organisation of the Hindu Bh^ts almost baffles descriptioD, so 
fluid are its intricacies. 

In Hissar are found two sub-castes, Brahm and a few Rdj. The 
former are clients of the Mahdjanpt, performing certain functions for 
them at weddings, &c.§ ; they wear the janeo, avoid widow marriage, 
and only eat food cooked by a Gaur Brahman ||, while the Rdj are land- 
holders and cultivators, receiving dues at Jdt weddings. 

The Brahm, Brahma or Brahmi Bhdts are very widely spread, and 
always appear to stand higher than the other sub-castes or groups, 
which vary from place to place. Thus in Rolitak the other groups are 

* Recently, however, some of them have taken to disguising themselves as Bairagi 
sddMs. Others, of Daska, make an indelible mark on their necks and call themselves 
Hosaiai Brahmans, collecting alms from Muhammadans.

three in number, viz., Japrg^ or Tappawd,r,* Ch^rant, and a fourth 
class, to which belonged Udd, Bh^t.J The Jagg^s comprise the BLaria, 
Roria, SbakkarwdU, Solanki and other gots. 

In Gurg^on on the other hand the Bh^t or Rai, as he is called, is de- 
scribed as a Mir^si, and is divided into four clas6es§ ; — 

y ( 1. Brahm Rai, Bhdts of the Brahmans. 

X 2. Bero (^Baro) Rai, of the Rajputs. 

jj f 3. R5.J Hai, who eat fiesh and drink liquor. 

(4. Jag^, or genealogists : of whom I is superior to II.|| 

The Brahm group then extends right across the south of the Punjab 
into Mult^n, Dera Ghdzi KhSn, Dera Isma'il, Mi^nwdli and even Bannu • 
the group below them being called K^timar.^H 

On the other hand in Multd,n the Brahm Bhd,t8 are said to be divided 
into four classes : — 

Chandi Dds. I Mahal. 

Jangd Bhambd,. | Sutrak. 

This group is also called Vateshar and regards itself as Bahrf or 
superior, while the Bunjd,his, who are not recognised as Brahm Bhd,ts 
comprise the following gfois : — 



Dehi Palsihar. 
Shenor. 
Sipal. 
Sugerlu. 



Agan-hotrl.^* Lakhnauri. 

Chandan. Manjhor. 

Dharor. Palsihar.

The real grouping in MuUin however appears to be into four func- 
tional groups, viz. : — 

1. Brahm, eulogists and genealogists. 

2. Vartishar, who live upon dues payable at weddings and funerals 
for their services. At weddings they summon the brotherhood, and so 
on. At deaths they notify its members, and also procure certain

and Garara. 



§ Apparently sub-castes : if not, I and II each form a sub-caste. But it is also said that 
the mirdsi^ of the Kajputs are called Kana or Ucharn Bhats, the E4nas being storv tellers 
and eulogists, as well as genealogists. And yet another account divides the ithats into four 
classes :— (1 . Rai Bhat, or ' meisteisingers.' (2^ Ranas "heralds " who used to act as envovs 
as well as encourage the fighting men by their singing of legends, (3) Kathaks or musicians' 
and (4) JagJis or genealogists and story tellers, '

articles for tbe corpse. At funerals their females take part in the 
sidjpd (mourning), being paid annas 2 per day. At a girl's wedding they 
get Ke. 1-8, but at a boy's only Re. 1, the sum which they also get 
at a funeral. Their perquisite on other occasions is called vel badhdi. 

3. The Chandisar live in the villages and live by begging. The 
Kdtimdrs who used to be numerous in Multdn, are an off-shoot of 
this branch. 

4. The Kutichar are vagrant beggars. 

Accounts from Mi^nwdli, in which District the Bhd,ts are very few 
in number, give a threefold division of the caste, as follows :— 

J C i. Brahmi. I jj f ii. Kdtimdr or Sheni Khel. 

^iii. KhosU. 1 ^ |iii. Baddu. 

I performs ceremonies : II does not, though at weddings the Kd,timd,r 
sing songs of congratulation. The Baddii in virtually an out-caste.* 

A second account points to the fact that the Bh^ts derive their origin 
from the Pushkarnd, Brahmans as well as from the Sd,rsut, and says the 
Pushkarni Bh^t are equal in status to the S^rsut.t though the status 
of the sections varies, and a family whose widows marry outside the 
brotherhood is looked down upon. 

Lastly a third account gives the old functional groups : the out who 
sing songs and recite chronicles ' in the afternoon 'J ; the Md,gadh, who 
keep pedigrees of kings, and recount their deeds : the Windijdn, who 
teach princes ; and the Bh^t or Jagak§ who sang songs in the early 
morning hours to awaken the king-. Yet this same account divides the 
Bhdts into Brahms and Kd,timdrs. 

In Multd,n, tahsil Shnj5bd,d, only the Brahm and Kdtimd,r groups are 
known. The former comprises 7 gots : Chandi Dds, Mahol, Sutrak, 
Changar, Palsa, Chandaria, and Channan, all of which are said to be 
Sdirsut gots and intermarry. The Kd,timd.r8, also said to be Sd.rsuts, 
form a distinct sub-caste. They have, as a rule, no clients, and live 
by blackmail, but in Shujd,bd,d itself they receive fixed dues (from one 
to four annas a h^ad at weddings). They still compose habits which 
the Brahm Bhdts do not. 

In the accounts from Karndl, Patid,ld. and KapurthaldH allusion is 

* The Baddd takes alms from Muhammadans, which other Bhats will not do. No other 
will eat with him, yet he wears the janeo. His corpse is not burnt like a Hindu's, but is cast 
into a stream. It is to be regretted that no further particulars of this interesting group are 
given.

II In Kapurthala to the Siit is assigned the duty of reciting verses from the Purans : and 
to the Magadh that of eulogising the Surajbans, Chandrbans, etc., while to the Vandijan is 
allotted the recitation of chronicles, and eulogising Deo, rilchi, pjtar and Hati kinondan, 
whence they are designated Kabishars or bards. The latter also announce betrothals, set 
forth the dowry at weddings, and so on. 



The Bhdt groups. 



97 



made to an older and apparently extinct organisation of the Bhdt caste 
into three main groups, viz. : — 

1. Sut, reciters of myths. 

2. M^o-adhs, chroniclers. 

3. Vaiidis, or Vandijan, who acted as advisers to Rdjas and as 
poets laureate. 

The Vandis alone are found in Patidld. where they are known as 
Brahmd Bhdts or Brahmsi Kais. They wear ihe janeo and retain their 
Brahminical gotras such as Konsal (in Kapurthald), Bhardwdj, etc. 

In their internal grouping the Brahm Bhdts imitate the Khatri 
organisation, having two groups as follows : — 

I. — BaRI, or the 12 GOTS. 



10. Phdg. 

11. Chandi dds. 

12. Dhiran. 



1. Gun deo. 4. Lakhau Sain. 7. Bhdriimal. 

2. Kataria. 5. Dhur. 8. Tdhu. 

3. Pangan. 6. Bisbel or -wel. 9. Kalian. 

and of these numbers 1 — 6 form a I)hd,ighar group, wiiich avoids only 
one got iu marriage, (as indeed does the whole Bd,ri group, apparently) 
whereas the Bunjahis avoid four. This latter group includes the 
following g^ois : — 



Bhulddia. 
Malaunia. 



Manohia. 
Saroha. 



Suridn. 
Tetia. 



Tuhdnia, etc. 



On the other hand in Shd,hpur the Bhdt are divided into Bunjdhis 
and Khokhars, the latter suggesting the Khokharain group of the 
Khatris, thus : — 



I.— BUNJAHIS. 



II,— Khokhars. <

Of these the Jain section will intermarry with any other, but 
from the above notes it is abundantly clear that the Bhdts are 
simply an offshoot of the Brahmans, being differentiated from them 
by function. And to explain their origin various legends have been 
invented. One is that when -Janmeja celebrated a sacrifice he sum- 
moned the Gaur Brahmans and tricked one of tliem into accepting an 
offering of a diamond hy concealing it in some pcin. This Brahman 
became a Bhdt. Another, to whom Janmeja offered a gift, refused it 
and became a Taggd. Another ia that iShiva was celebrating the 
marriage of his son, and giving alms to Jogis, Jangams, Sanidsis and 
Suthrds, who received them with a good grace. Thereupon the god 
asked if any would constrain him to give alms, and a drop of sweat 
falling from his brows to the ground the first Bhdt pprang from 



Bhdt legends. 

it, with a Jcatdr in hia hands, and uttered a kalit which runs : — " 
goddess Kd^likd., give the Bhdt a Jcatdr whose sight will cause a close- 
fisted man {shum) to flee. Let the Bhd-t cleave him from head to foot 
with his /ca^dr." Shiva replied : — "0 Betal Rai, Bhdt, I would have 
given you the kingdom of the whole world had you not appeared thus. 
Now I grant you great influence and all will be terrified at your voice, 
but you will get what you may/' This habit, obtained from a Bhdt, 
would make all the Bhdts professional extortioners. A third tradition 
is that Brahmd offered gifts to Brahmans, but they all refused it, until 
one of their sisters' sons accepted it and thus became a Bhdt. 

Two legends from the Simla hills also describe the origin of the 
Bhdts. The first explains how they acquired the power of reading 
men's thoughts. Under Rdjd Bhoj,* it sayp, lived Kdli Dds, a famous 
Bhdt who held that a man could say anything he wished in poetry, 
and so Kdli, the goddess, pleased with his devotion, conferred on 
him the power of thought-reading. The other legend goes further 
back, and describes how Rdjd Jaswantt had a wise counsellor in a 
woman Khankdli. Once when he was holding his court at Srinagar 
in Garhwdl the Rdjd of Mdrwdr, Jagdeo, came to see him and found 
him and Khankdli in council. The lady veiled her face, explaining 
that as a man had come to that cowardly court she could not show her 
face before him. This reply naturally annoyed Jaswant who declared 
he would give her 10 times as much as Jagdeo would bestow. Khankdli 
then went to Jagdeo's tent ; but as he was at his devotions his Rdnl 
gave her a dish full of gold coins and gems which Khankdli refused to 
accept, as she could take no alms from a woman. When the Rdjd 
came she presented him with a rupee, as a nazr, and said she was the 
wife of a Bhdt and had come to demand dan (charity), which one of 
Rdjput blood could not refuse. He bade her ask a favour, and she de- 
manded his head, which the Rdjd at once cut off, and she carried it in a 
dish to Rdjd Jaswant. Tauntingly Jaswant asked what she had got 
from Jagdeo, who had fled from his own kingdom and sought a refuge 
with himself. In reply Khankdli showed him the head and demanded 
those of himself and his 9 sons in fulfilment of his vow, threatening him 
with the ruin of his kingdom if he refused. The king's sons, his queen, 
and he himself, however, all declined to sacrifice their lives in fulfilment 
of the Rdjd's rash promise. 

Khankdli then returned to Jagdeo's tent. She had forbidden his 
queen to burn his body till she returned, and when she found the Rdni 
lamenting over his corpse she restored it to life and promised him the 
empire of all India. This he soon achieved. In the first encounter 
Jaswant was overthrown and Jagdeo seized his kingdom. Gradually 
he subdued all the petty chiefs in India, compelling them to pay 
6 annas in the rupee as tribute. From Khankdli and Kdli Dds the 
Bhdt chain descends. 

In Sirmur the Bhdts are by origin Brahmans,J but having adopted 
karewa they lost status and are iiow by occupation genealogists. 
Many, too, are cultivators and trans-Giri mairy with Kanets. The

Blidts of Nd,haTi retain Brahman customs, but those of the interior have 
adopted those of the Kanets. With the Kanets the Bh^t3 furnish the 
Dewds or priests to the temples. Trans-Giri there is a sub-division of 
tVie Bhd,ts called Deti, but the rest of the Bhdts do not intermarry with 
them and they are inferior to the other groups. 

The Muhammadan Bhats. 
The Muhammadan Bhdts are even fewer in numbers than the Hindu, 
and far less elaborately organised. In Hissdr they date their con- 
version to A'lamgir^s reign, and still continue to minister to Mahdjans 
and other Hindus as well as to Mughals and Pirzildas, but Shaikhs 
only fee them at a daughter's wedding; as do also oilmen and weavers 
who give them 8 annas. But they get fees on the birth of a son. In 
Rohtak they have only three sections, Bijhdu. Sil Saha and Gur Deva, 
of whom the latter recite genealogies and compose songs. 

Their patrons are Muhammadan Rajputs and Hindu Mahiijans, and 
they receive —

The 



The Bhat's fdnctions. 

The functions of the Bhdt differ in different parts of these Provinces. 
In the south-eastern districts he is not entrusted with any religious 
functions at all. Thus in Rohtak the Brahm Blidts merely get 
annas 4 to 8 on the bridegroom's departure at a wedding ; and the 
guests at a rich man'ss funeral are invited through a Bh^tj ^^° receives 
Re. I in cash, and a turban when the pagri is tied round the heir's 
head. A Bh^^ also summons the kinsmen to witness an excommuni-

cation or a re-admission into caste.* As we go westward, however, the 
Bhd-t's functions become more definite, assuming at times almost a 
priestly colour, while his perquisites are correspondingly larger and more 
certain. Thus ia Kapiirthal<i the Brahm Bhdt sings congratulatory 
songs at a betrothal, at the saia chitthi, at a chhotd tikd, or marking 
of the bridegroom's forehead, the milni,i or meeting of the bride and 
bridegroom, at the lawdn or turina, the mittha bhdt and the chirJcani, 
receiving a fee of annas 2 or so, together with other rails. 

After a death the Bhdt remains for 13 days in the deceased's house 
and helps to procure what is required ; at a shdnt he gets a rupee ; 
and at a such he gets a similar fee with certain clothes : —

In the western districts the Bhd,tni fulfils the duties of a professional 
mourner. Thus in Shdhpur she leads the mourning by the women 
of the deceased's brotherhood for a fee of Re. 1, and in Dera Ghd,zi 
Khd.n she does this for a wage of 2^ annas a day, besides what the 
relatives may give her. 

In Kd,ngra§ the only relic of the Bhdt's former functions is the 
making of hahits, and a proverb runs : — Bhdt hi bhet kahit, i.e., a Bhat 
will always make a present of a kahit. Like the parohit and the barber

sing congratulatory songs on auspicious occasions for a fee of four double-pice, raised at 
weddings to Re. 1-4-0.

X But in Dera Ghazi Khan this is done by the Jajik, 

§ This is the account from Hami'rpur. In Nurpur tahsil Bhats merely visit the house of a 
newly married couple and receive a small fee, earning their living by cultivation. In 
Kangra tahsil they sometimes at a wedding get a fee called durbhia, which varies from 
3 pies to 2 annas : they also get one at an investiture with the janeo, and at weddings the 
girl's father gives his Bhat annas 2 and some cloth, while the boy's Bhit gets Re. 1-4.0, but 
they perform no rites. "

Bhatti. The name Bhatti would appear to be unquestionably connected 
with Bhat, Bhatt, Bhd,ti and Bhatiti, Bhatt bearing the same relation 
to Bh^t as Jatt to Jat, kamm in Punjabi to kcim, etc. As a tribe the 
Bhattis are of some antiquity, numerous and wide-spread. They give 
their name to the Bhatti^na* and to the Bhattioraf tracts, as well 
as to various places, such as Bhatinda, Bhatner, Pindi Bhatti^n and 
possibly the Bhatti^t in Chamba. Historically the Bhattis first appear 
to be mentioned in the TLirikh-i-Firoz-shdhi of Shams-i-8iraj Afif, and 
the following notes are culled from the translation of that work in 
Elliott's Sist. of India : — 

In the reign of Ald-ud-Din, Tughlik of Khurasan obtained the 
district of Dipd>lpnr, of which Abohar was a dependency. To Abohar 
were attached all the jungles belonging to the Mini (Mina ?) and 
Bhatti tribes. Tughlik, anxious to ally his family with the native 
chiefs, heard that the daughters of Rdna Mall Bhatti were beautiful 
and accomplished, so he sent the amalddr of Abohar to negotiate the 
alliance of one of them with his brother, Sipahsd-lar Rajab. In his 
pride the Rana rejected these overtures, and so Tughlik proceeded to 
levy the outstanding revenue from the talivandls of the Bhattis with 
great severity. The Rdna's daughter, Bibi Naila, hearing of this, urged 
her own surrender. ' Consider,' she said, ' that the Mughals have carried 
off one of your daughters.' She was accordingly married to Rajab, 
assumed the name of Bibi Kadbanu, and became the mother of Firoz 
Shah III in 1309 A. D.f 

In 1394 Strang Khan was sent to Dipdlpur to suppress the 
rebellion of Shaikha Khokhar. There he raised troops and, taking 
with him Rai Khul Chain Bhatti and Rai Daud Kamdl Main (? Mina), 
he crossed the Sutlej near Tirhdrah (Tihjira, in Ludhiana).§ 

In 1389 we read of Rai Kamdl-ud-din Main (? Mina) and Rai Khul 
Chand Bhatti whose fiefs lay near Samana, being sent with Prince 
Hum6yun to raise troops at that fortress. I|

1 02 Bhatti clans. 

Timur found Bhatner unJer the rule of Rao Diil Chain,* a Rajput, 

and probably a Bhatti. Curiously enough he is represented as having 

a brother named Kamal-ud-din, and in one history Khul Chain is said 
to have been the Rai of Bhatner.t 

Again in 1527 we read of Mirza Kd,mran'8 coming from Lahore, with 
many horses and much wealth taken from the Bhattis and Khokhars.f 

The legends of the Bhattis are, however, silent on these events and 
ascribe the origin of the tribe to Achal through Barsi, who extended 
his dominions from the south to Bhatner, which they held until expelled 
from it by the Rdjdof Bikaner early in the 19th century. Then they 
spread over Bhattiana, which comprised the modern tahsil of Sirsa 
and the northern part of Fatehdbad. The tribe is now found princi- 
pally along the Ghaggar valley as far as Bhatntr. 

Various other traditions are, however, current in different localities 
and of these the most probable is that which connects the Bhattis 
with Jaisalmir. The story current in HissAr is that they were in very 
early times driven across the Indus, but returned and some 700 years 
ago dispossessed the Langdh, Joiya and other tribes of the country 
to the south of the lower Sutlej, Rud founded Jaisalmir, which State 
they still hold. Bhatti, the leader under whom they recrossed the 
Indus, had two sons Dasal and Jaisal. The former settled in Bhattiana 
and from him are descended the Sidhu-Bardr J^ts, the "Wattu being 
also descendants of his grandson, Rjijput. With this tradition may 
be compared the foUowing detailed account of the Bhattis of BahdiWal- 
pur, in which State they have 15 principal clans :— 

i. The Bhattis, or pure Bhattis, who are generally landowners 
or cultivators, though some are weavers and blacksmiths. 

ii. Pahor, found throughout the Lamma. 

iii. Chus. 

iv. Jogi and 

V. Jandd,ni. 

These five septs are closely connected, do not give daughters ont- 
eide the group, and usually intermarry. 

vi. Shaikhra. 

vii. Chakar-HuUe : a small sept, of recent origin called Chakar- 
ullah or servants of God. 

viii. Lallu. 

ix. Bhdbhe : a small sept. 

X. Katesar : also a small sept, which rears sheep. 

xi. Kulyar or Kawalyfir which has an interesting history :— 

Kulyar was a son of Rd-na Raj Wadhan, who had four other sons, 
(1) Dtterd, (2) Ntan, (3) Kdnjun, (4) Hatdr. The tradition is that the

ancestors of Rdj Wadhan lived in ancient times near Ghajni, whence 
they migrated to Delhi, which after a time they left for Bha^ner. 
In the 7th century of the Hijra Rdj Wadhan together with his tribe 
left Bhatner and settled near Chhanb Kulydr (now in the Lodhrdn 
tahsil of Mult^n), which in those days lay on the southern bank of 
the Sutlej and formed part of the dominions of Rai Bhuttit, the ruler 
of a city, the greater part of which was destroyed by the Sutlej flowing 
over it; ; but parts of its ruins are still to be seen on the right bank 
of the Gb^ra (in tahsil Lodhrdn). R^nd, Rd,j Wadhan had a beautiful 
daughter whom Rai Bhuttd, desired to marry. The request was refused 
by Kulydr, the eldest son of Rilj Wadhan ; and the result was that a 
sanguinary battle took place in which Rai Bhuttd, was slain. The 
tract of the country thus conquered by the Kulyd,rs became known as 
Chhanb Kulyilr, which name it still retains. At this time Sher Shdh 
Sayyid Jaldl was living in Uch, where Rfln^ R^j Wadhan and his sons 
went to see him and embraced IsMm. Rdj Wadhan remained Jat Uch, 
Utterd, occupied the ' Vidh ' (Bi^s)*, Nun began to live on the Rdvi, 
(and that tribe is now dominant in Shujdbdd tahsil), Kanjun at the 
Don^ri Mari (?), and Kulyilr made Chhanb Kulydr his residence. 
Hat^r was deprived of his share of the inheritance.t 
xii. Daragh. 

xiii. Sangrd, : with a famous sept called W^gi. In the 8th 
century Hijra the Sangrds migrated from Rdjput^na and 
settled in Kathdla, then a large town on the Gurang or 
Hariari, the ruins of which are still to be seen near Tibba 
Tdnwin-wd,la. Kath^la was at that time held by the Joiyas. 

xiv. Mahtam : the Muhammadan Mahtams claim to be Bhattis 
and say a mirnsi once ironically called their ancestor 
'Mahtam, 'or chief. They appear to be distinct from the 
Hindu Mahtams. 

XV. Bhet : who claim to have been Bhattis who accompanied 
Shaikh Hakim from Delhi, but are said by others to be 
Dhedhs or Menghwals, whom that saint converted. 

xvi. Markand, Bokha, Jhakhkhar, Dhandla, Phanbi, Bir^r, 
Dadu, Kap3,hi (cotton-workers and reed-cutters), and 
K^hin, are nine clans descended from the same ancestor 
and they intermarry. Some are landowners, others tenants, 
but some are boatmen, and though Bhattis by origin they 
are regarded as of low status. 

On the south-east border of the Punjab the subject population of 
Bikiiner is largely composed of Bhattis, and tradition J almost alwajs 



* The tradition is that in those days the Bias flowed separately to the north of Kahror 
towards Shuj^bad. 

t The Mittru Bhatti of Multan say they came from Bikaner. 

J The Hissar tradition is very different and says that the ihattis are of the Jdtu family, 
and that like the T-unwar Rajputs they trace their origin to remote antiquity. At some 
distant period, two persons named bhatti and feumija are said to have come to this country 
from Mathra. The latter had no male issue, and his descendants (called Joiya Rajputs) 
live in Sirsa. After some generations tne of the Jamily of the former, niinnd Kusalu, 
became Baja— he had two sens, Dusul and Jaisul. 'J he latter became haja oi Jaisalmir, 
where his descendants still reign. The former remained in Bhatti«na— hf had cnJy ore son, 
named Janra, who had several wive." (all of other castes) by whom he had 21 gons, whoee

carries us back to the ancient city of Bhatner, which lies on the banks 
of the long since dry Ghaggar, iii the territory of that State bordering 
on Sirsa. But in that tract, which corresponds to the old Bhatti^na, 
the Bhatti is no longer a dominant tribe and the term is loosely applied 
to any Muharamadan Jdt or Rajput from the direction of tbe Sutlej, 
as a generic term almost synonymous with R^th or Pachh^da. 

In the central Punjab, however, and towards the north of it, the 
Bhattis, though scattered, hold strong positions. In Amritsar tradition 
avers that they have a Mong pedigree' beginning with Adam, 10th in 
descent from whom was Krishna, sim of Jad, the son of Jadam. And 
the present State of KapurthaU was held by a Raj^ who sought the 
aid of Lakhanpal and Harpal, sons of theR^oa, Purab Chand, of Bhatner 
against his foes. Accompanied by Panp^l, a third son of the Rand 
by a J at wife, tbey overran the neighbouring country ; but the Raja 
refused to give them the share he had agreed to bestow upon them, 
so they put him to death and partitioned his kingdom, Lakhanpal 
taking the Bdri Dodb, Harpal that of the Bist Jdlaudbar and Panpll 
the modern Ferozepur District, ilai Viru, Lakhanpd,l's great-grandson, 
founded Vairowal in Amritsar some 540 years ago and his grand- 
daughter, a sister of Rai Mitha, was married to Rai Ibrahim of 
Kapurthald., himself a Bhatti and descended from Harpal. But after a 
futile attempt to subdue Rai Mitha, Ibrahim forbade intermarriage 
between the two branches. 

Kapurthald, tradition is, however, quite silent as to Lakhanpal or 
Harpal, and, according to leorends current in that State, Rai Nd,nak 
Chand is said to have left Bhatner and settled in Bhuldua, in that 
State. Three brothers Bhatti, Manj and Chauhd,n founded the Rajput 
tribes so named, which settled in the Punjab only 14 generations ago. 

Nevertheless reciprocal marriage is confined to the Bhatti, Manj 
Naru and Khokhar* tribes, which avoid marriage with the Chauhdu, 
Awan, Nipdl, Bajoha, Janjua, Punwd,r, Varyd. 

The Khokhars and Nd,rus are regarded as foreign by race to the other 
Rdjputs, who all trace back their desoent to R5,ja Salivahan who has 
a shrine at Sidlkot. He is said to have been defeated by Imdm N3,sir. 

In Gujrdt tbe Bhattis trace their first settlements back to Dulla 
Bhatti, Rd.jd. of Pindi Bhattid,n who was put to death by Akbar. All 
his family was in Akbar's camp on the Jhelum, where they were kept 
in durance until released at the intercession of a faqir whose shrine 
is still pointed out at Chhapar on the bank of that river. Bulla's son, 
Kamdl Khd,n was allowed to settle on the waste lands near Ghamd;n, 
still a Bhatti village, while the rest returned to Pindi Bbatti^n.f 



descendants established different tribes, such as the Lal-hhcdl, Sidhij, and Barar Jats. Janra 
foiinded the town of Abohur, naming it after his wife Abho— by this wife he had three 
sons- Rajpal, Chun and Dhum :— the Wattu Bajputs are descendants of the first- the Mai 
Bajputs of the second— and the Nawab of Rania and his family, of the third. Inasmuch as 
the Bhattis were more num.erous than the rest, the country was called Bhattiana. The 
habits, manners and customs of Bhatti Rajputs are similar to those of the Tunwar Hajputs.

A Bhatti pedigree.

The Bhatti of the Guji'anwdla Bdr, where they are the " natural 
enemies of the Virk," are descended from one Dhir, who eighteen 
generations ago left Bhatner, and settled in the Nur Mahnl jungles- as 
a grazier and freebooter. His grandson went furtlier on to the banks 
of the R^vi, and his son again moved up into the uplands of Guirln- 
w^ia. The modern descendants of these men are described as " a 
muscular and noble-looking race of men, agricuUurists more by 
constraint than by nntural inclination, who keep nu'nerous herds of 
cattle which graze over the pasture lands of the Bir, only plough 
just sufficient to grow food for their own necessities, and are famous 
as cattle-lifters and notorious thieves." The Bhatti of Gujranwala 
enjoyed considerable political importance in former times, and they 
still hold 86 villages in that District. In Sidlkot the Bhatti claim 
de^jcent from Bhoni seventh in descent frrim their eponymous ancestor 
Bhatti, who came to Gnjr^nwala from Bikdner, and thence to Sialkot.

neighbouring Jfit tribes, though they will take wives from among them 
without scruple.* In the Salt-range the Bhatti seem to bold a very 
Subordinate position as Bhatti, though it may be that some of the 
innumerable Rajput tribes of that tract may consider themselves 
Bhatti, as well as what«-ver their local name may be. The Bhatti of 
Jhang hold the considerable Bhattiora tract north of the Ghendb, 
They came first from Bhatner to the right bank of the Jhelum near 
the Shahpur border, and thence to Bhattiora. They are described as 
"a fine race of men, industrious agriculturists, hardly at all in debt, 
good horse-breeders, and very fond of sport. They do very little 
cattle-lifting, but are much addicted to carrying off each other's 
wives.^' 

The persistence of the traditions which connect the Bhattis with 
Bikdner, Jaisalmer and the old fortress of Bhatner cannot be disre- 
garded. But for a fuller discussion of their origins see Rajpdt,

no land in the plains ; to the south it holds a strip of very fertile 
country extending from the Takwdra along the hills as far as Dabbra. 
It has a few scattered liamlets in the Nasrd-n country north of the 
Takw^ra, and is also found in considerable numbers in the north-east of 
the Gtimal valley. To the west the hill couniry of the Bhittannis ia 
hemmed in by that of tlie Wazirs. The two tribes are generally more 
or less at feufi, though the Bhittannis, til] recently, never scrupled to 
assist Wazir robbers in their incursiona into British territory. 

The Bhittaonis live in small villages, generally hidden away in 
hollows. Their houses are mud and brushwood hovels of the poorest 
description, and sometimes they hve in caves hollowed out of the 
rock. One of their principal places is Jandola, ou the road leading up 
the Tdnk zam to the Wazir country. 

The tribe is divided into three sections : Dhanna, Tatta and Wraspun. 
In the plains the lands of the Bhittannis were originnlly dividend into 
numerous s-nall divisions, known as ndlds. Each naldy as a rule, 
forms a single plot, owned by a number of families generally closely 
connected by birth. The waste land in each ndld is the property of 
the ndld proprietors. B«^fore land became valuable, the proprietors 
of the different TiiZ'is used readily to admit men of their own sub- 
section to a share in the ndld lands, and in this way, men, who had 
before lived exclusively in the hills, were continually settling in the 
plains. There has never been, therefore, any actual division of the 
conrtry on shares, and tlie present proprietors hold purely on a 
squatting tenure. The lands of the Wraspuns lie to the no i th^ the 
Tattas to the south, and the Dhannas in the middle. The Dhannaa 
own much less land than the other two sections, and fewer of them 
reside in the plains. The plain Bhittannis live in scattered hirris or 
villages. The larger ndlds have separate kirria and headmen of their 
owUj but more generally the people of several ndlds live together in 
one kirri, under a common headman. 
Bhojiya, a Muhammadan Jd,t clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 
Bhojki, a term applied to the pujdris or officiants at the great shrines of 
Devi, such as that of Jawiilamukhi, that at Bhaun in the Kangra 
District, Naina Devi io Hoshi^rpur, etc. The Bhojkis were said by 
Barnes to be *' not Br^hmans, thoufj;h they are the hereditary priests of 
these celebrated temples. They all wear the sacred thread; they 
intermarry among themselves alone, eat flesh, drink wine, and are a 
debauched and profligate set ; the men are constantly in the Courts 
involved in litigation, and the women are notorious for their loose 
morality." Colonel Jenkins writes of them: — "The Bhojkis are 
perhaps a unique feature of the Kdngra District. They claim to be 
Sdrsut Br^hmaus ; but if so, have certainly sunk in the social scale, 
as no ordinary Brahmans would eat kachi rasoi with them. They 
appear to occupy much the same position as the Gangaputras of 
Benares, and the probability is that they are mere Jogis who have 
obtained a reflected sanctity from the goddesses whose service they 
have entered. The name is evidently couneeted with the Sanskrit root 
bhoj to feed,"*^ and is taken from the nature of their duties. They

intormarry among themselves and with a class of Jogis called Bodha 
Pandits. Another account states that the Bhojkis of Bhaun do not 
give daughters to those of Jaw^lamukhi or Naina Devi, though up 
to Sambat 1936 they used to accept brides from the latter, whom 
they regard as inferiors. The Bhojkis of Bliaun now otdy intermarry 
among tliemaelves, excluding their own got and the mother's relatives 
up to the 7th desrree. But they also intermarry with the Pandit 
Bodhas and the Bararas. The former are said to be Brdhraans, 
but both they and the Bararas take a deceased's shroud, etc., like the 
Achdraj. The Bhojkis of Chintpurni are Brahmans and marry with 
Brahmans, and will not even smoke with those of Bhaun, etc.'^

between Rohtds and Hatyd, to which they give their name of Bugi^l.t 

Bhular. — The Bhular, Her, and Min tribes call themselves asl or 
" original'^ Jd-ts, and are said to have sprung from the^ai or " matted 
hair" of Mnhd-deo, whose title is Bhola {' simple') Ma hadeo. They 
say that the Mdlwa was their original home, and are commonly 
reckoned as two and a half tribeN, the H^r only counting a? a half. 
But the bards of the Man, among which tribe several famihes have 
ris^n to political importance, say that the whole of the Man and Bhular 
and half the Her tribe of Rajputs were the earliest Kshatriya immi- 
grants from Rajputana to the Punjab. The head-quarters of the 
Bhular appear to be Lahore and Ferozepur, and the confines of the 
Md^njha and Malwa; but they are returned in small numbers from 
every division in the Punjd,b except Delhi and R^walpindi^ from almost 
every District, and from every Native vState of the Eastern Plains 
except Dujdna, Loharu, and Pataudi. The tribe is probably not a 
wholly homogeneous one. In Jind its Sidh is Kalanjar, whose samddh 
is at Mdri, and to it milk is offered on the 14th feat^j of each month ; 
also cloth at a wedding or the birth of a son. In Si^lkot its Sidh is

Bhular are Hindu and Muhammadan Jdts and classed as agricultural.

Bhutta. — The Bhutta are said by the late Mr. E. O'Brien to have traditions 
connecting them with Hindustan, and they claim to be descended from 
Solar Rajputs. But since the rise to opulence and importance of 
Pirzada Murad Bakhsh Bhutta, of Multdn, many of them have taken to 
calling themselves Pirzddas. One account is that they are immigrants 
frooi Bhutan — a story too obviously suggested by the name. They 
also often practise other crafts, such as making pottery or weaving, 
instead of or in addition to agriculture. They are said to have held Uch 
(in Brthawalpur) before the Sayyids came there. They are chiefly found on 
the lower Indus, CheniibandJiielum, in Shahpur, Jhang, Multdn, Muzaf- 
fargarh, and Dera Gh^zi Khan. In Jhang most are returned as Rdjputs. 
The Bhutta shown scattered over the Eastern Plains are perhaps mem- 
bers of the small Bhutnaor Bhutra clan of Malwa Jdts. kSeealso Butar. 
and Buta. Maclagan describes them as a Jdt or Bdjput clan found in 
Multiin tahsll and allied to the Langahs, etc., Bhutta, Langd>h, Dahar, 
Shajrd and Naich, being said to be sons of Mahli in tne couplet : — 

SagJii, jihdndi dddi, Sodi jihdndi md,

A branch of this clan at Khairpur near Multaa is in the transition 
stage towards becoming Sayyid. 

According to the Bahawalpur tradition the Bhutta are of the same 
stock as the Bhdtia.* When Dewa Rawal, sister's son ot Raj^ Jajja 
Bhutto, was building the fort now called Derawar Jajja in a fit of 
jealousy stopped its construction ; whereupon his sister who was married 
to a Bhatia Rajput thus addressed him : — 

Rdi Jajja Bhutta sen ivain hi hhain puchhde, 
Kaya Bhutta hay a Bhatia Kot usdran de.

BiSHNOij* Pablad Bansi, (fr. Vishnu, one of the Hindu Trinity), a sect 
whose founder Jhdmbaji lived towards the end of the 15th century. 
Tradition says that at Piupdsar, a village soutli of Bikdner, in 
the Jodhpur territory, lived Laut, a Rajput Punw^r, who had attained the 
age of 60 and had no son. One day a neighbour going out to sow his 
field met Laut, and deeming it a bad omen to meet a childless man, 
turned back from his purpose. This cut Laut to the quick, and he 
went out to the jungle and bewailed his childlessness until evening, 
when a faqir appeared to him and told him that in nine months he 
should have a son, and after showing his miraculous power by drawing 
milk from a calf, vanished from his sight. At the time named a child 
miraculously appeared iu Laut's house, and was miraculously suckled 
by his wife Hdnsa.t This happened in Sambat 15U8 (A.D. 1451). 
For seven years the boy, who was an incarnation {autdr) of Vishnu, 
played with his fellowR, and then for 27 years he tended cattle, but all 
this time he spoke no word. His miraculous powers were shown in 
various wayn, such as producing sweets from nothing for tbe delectation 
of his companions, and he became known as Achamba (the Wonder), 
whence his natce of Jhamba, by which he is generally known. After 
34 years, a Brahman was sent for to get him to speak and on bis 
confessing his failure Jhd,mbaji again showed his power by lighting a 
lamp by simply snapping his fingers, and uttered his first word. He 
then adopted the life of a teacher, and went to reside on a sandhill, 
Bome thirty miles south of Bikaner, where after 51 years he died and 
was buried, instead of being burnt, hke an ordinary Hindu. 

Another account of Jh^mbaji says that — 

" When a lad of five he used to take his father's herds to water at 
the well, and had for each head of cattle a peculiar whistle ; the cows 
and bullocks would come one by one to the well, drink and go away. 
One day a man named Udaji happened to witness this scene, and, 
struck with astonishment, attempted to follow the boy when he left the 
well. He was on horseback and the boy on foot, but gallop as fast 
aa he would he could not keep up with the walking pace of the boy. 
At last, in amazement, he dismounted and threw himself at his feet. 
The boy at once welcomed him by name, though he then saw him for 
the first time. The bewildered tjdaji exclaimed Jhdmhaji (omni- 

♦ Pronounced Viahnoi in Buhawalpur and £fk4ner. 

I Aooordiog to the Hiasar Settlement Report bia parents were Lohub-aad Kesar, 



Biahnoi tenets, m 

scient), and henceforth the boy was known by this name. On attaining 
manhood, Jbdimbaji leit his home, and, becoming a faqir or religious 
mendicant, ia said to have remained seated upon a sandhill called 
Samrathal in Bik^ner, for a space of 51 years. In 1485 a fearful famine 
desolated the country, and Jhduibaji gained an enormous number of 
disciples hy providing food for all that would declare their belief in him. 
He is said to have died on his sandhill, at the good old age of 84, and 
to have been buried at a spot about a mile distant frora it.'^ 

A further Account says that his body remained suspended for six 
months in the pinjra without decomposing. 

The name Bishnoi is of course connected with that of Vishnu the 
deity to whom the Bishnoia give most prominence in their creed 
though sometimes they themselves derive it from the 29 {his-nau) 
articles of faith inculcated by their founder. In fact it was very 
difficult in our returns to distinguish the Rishnoi from the Vaishnav 
who was often entered as a Baishnav or Bislino. The Bishnois some- 
times call themselves Prahlddbansis or Prahlddpanthis,"^ on the ground 
that it was to please Prahld,d-bhagat that Vishnu became incarnate in 
the person of Jhdmbaji. The legend is that 33 crores of beings were 
born along with Prahldd and five crores of them were killed by the 
wicked Hirndkash, and when Vishnu, as the Narsin^h avatar, saved the 
life of Prahldrd and asked Prahliid to name his dearest wish, the latter 
requested that Vishnu would effect the salvation (mukt) of the remain- 
ing 28 crores. To do this required a further incarnation, and Jh^mbaif 
was the result. 

Tenets of the Bishnois. — Regarding the doctrines of the sect Sir 
James Wilson,t from whom I have already quoted, writes: — 

" The sayings {sabd) of Jhambaji to the number of 120 were written 
down by his disciples, and have been handed down in a book (pothi) 
written in the Ndgri character and in a dialect similar to B^gri 
seemingly a Md,rwd,ri dialect. The 29 precepts given by him for the 
guidance of his followers are as follows : — 

Tis din sutak—vdnch roz ratwanti ndri 

Sera karo shndn — sil — santokh — suchh pydri 

Pdni — bdni — idhni — itnd lijyo chhdn. 

Dayd — dharm hirde dharo — garu hatdi jdn 

Chori — nindya — jhiUh — barjya had na kariyo koe 

Amal— tamdku — bhang — Hi dnr hi tydgo 

Mad — 7nds se dekhke dur hi bhdgo. 

Amar rakhdo that — bail tani nd bdho 

Amdshya barat — ri'inkh lilo rue ghdo. 

Horn jap samddh jnljd — b'ish baikunthi pdo 

TJntis dharrti ki dkhri garu batdi soe 

Fdh'il doe par chdvya jisko nam Bishnoi hoe, 
which is thus interpreted : — "For 30 days after child-birth and five 
after a menstrual discharge a woman must not cook food. Bathe in 
the morning. Commit not adultery. Be content. Be abstemious and 
pure. Strain your drinking water. Be careful of your speech. Ex-

112 Bishnoi observances, 

amine your fuel in case any living creature be burnt with it. Show 
pity to livinof creatures. Keep duty present to your raind as the 
Teacher bade. Do not speak evil of others. Do not tell lies. Never 
quarrel. Avoid opium, tobacco, bhang and blue clothing. Flee from 
spirits and flesh. See that your goats are kept alive (nob sold to 
Musalm^ns, who will kill them for food). Do not plough with bullocks. 
Keep a fast on the day before the new moon. Do not cut green trees. 
Sacrifice with fire. Say prayers. Meditate. Perform worship and 
attain Heaven. And the last of the 29 duties prescribed by the 
Teacher — ' Baptize your children, if you would be called a true 
Bishnoi'." 

Some of these precepts are not strictly obeyed ; for instance, 
although ordinarily they allow no blue in their clothing, yet a Bishnoi, 
if he is a servant of the British Government, is allowed to wear a blue 
uniform ; and Bishnois do use bullocks, though most of their farming 
is done with camels. They also seem to be unusually quarrelsome (in 
words) and given to use bad language. But they abstain from tobacco, 
drugs and spirits, and are noted for their regard for animal life, which 
is such that not only will they not themselves kill auy living creature, 
but they do their utmost to prevent others from doing so. Conse- 
quently their villages are generally swarming with antelope and other 
animals, and they forbid their Musalmdn neighbours to kill them 
and try to dissuade European sportsmen from interfering with 
them. They wanted it made a condition of their settlement, that no 
one should be allowed to shoot on their land, but at the same time 
they asked that they mitjht be assessed at lower rates than their 
neighbours on the ground that the antelope being thus left undisturbed 
do more damage to their crops; but I told them this would lessen the 
merit {'pun) of their good actions in protecting the animals, and they 
must be treated just as the surrounding villages were. They consider 
it a good deed to scatter grain to pigeons and other birds, and often 
have a large number of half-tame birds about their villages. The day 
before the new moon they observe as a Sabbath and fast-day, doing no 
work in the fields or in the house. They bathe and pray three times a 
day, — in the morning, afternoon, and in the evening — saying'' Bishno, 
Bishno " instead of the ordinary Hindu " R^m Rd,m." Their clothing 
is the same as of other Bagris, except that their women do not allow 
the waist to be seen, and are fond of wearing black woollen clothing. 
They are more particular about ceremonial purity than ordinary Hindus 
are, and it is a common saying that if a Bishnoi's food is on the first of 
a string of twenty camels, and a man of another caste touches the 
last camel of the string, the Bishnoi would consider his food defiled 
and throw it away." 

The ceremony of initiation is as follows : — 

" A number of representative Bishnois assemble, and before them a 
sddh or Bishnoi priest, after lighting a sacrificial fire {horn) instructs the 
novice in the duties of the faith. He then takes some water in a new 
earthen vessel, over which he prays in a set form {Bishno gdyatri), 
stirring- it the while with his string of beads [rudla), and after asking 
the consent of the assembled Bishnois, he pours the water three times 
into the hands of the novice, who drinks it off. The novice's Bcalp 



Bishnoi rites. H^ 

lock {choti) is then cut off and his head shaved, for the Bishnois shave 
the whole head and do not leave a scalp-lock like the Hindus ; but they 
allow the beard to grow, ouly shaving the chiu on the father's death. 
Infant baptism is also practised, and 30 days after birth the child 
whether boy or girl, is baptised by the priest {sddh) in much the same 
way as an adult ; only the set form of prayer is different {garbh- 
gdyatri), and the priest pours a few drops of water into the child's 
mouth, and gives the child's relatives each three handfuls of the con- 
secrated water to drink; at the same time the barber clips off the 
child's hail'. This baptismal ceremony also has the effect of purifying 
the house which has been made impure by the birth {sutak).'^ 

The Bislinois intermarry among themselves only, and by a ceremony 
of their own in which it seems the circumambulation of the sacred fire, 
which is the binding ceremony among the Hindus generally, is omitted. 
They do not revere Brahmans,t but have priests {sadhs} of their own, 
chosen from among the laity. They do not burn their dead, but bury 
them below the cattle-stall or in a place frequented by cattle, such as a 
cattle-pen. They observe the Holi in a different way from other Hindus. 
After sunset on that day they fast till the next forenoon, when, after 
hearing read the account of how Prahldd was tortured by his infidel 
father Harn^kash for believing in the god Vishnu, until he was deliver- 
ed by the god himself in his incarnation of the Lion-man, and mourning 
over Prahld,d's sufferings, they light a saciificial fire and partake of 
consecrated water, and after distributing unpurified sugar iguf) in 
commemoration of Prahldd's delivery from the fire into which he was 
thrown, they break their fast. Bishnois go on pilgrimage where 
Jhdmbaji is buried, south of Bik^ner, where there is a tomb {mat) over 
his remains and a temple (mandir) with regular attendants (pujari) . 
A festival takes place here every six months, in Asauj and Phdgan, 
when the pilgrims go to the sandhill on which Jhd,mbaji lived, and 
there light sacrificial fires (horn') oi jandi wood in vessels of stone, and 
offer a burnt offering of barley, til, ghi and sugar, at the same 
time muttering set prayers. They also make presents to the attendants 
of the temple, and distribute moth and other grain for the peacocks 
and pigeons, which live there iif numbers. Should any one have 
committed an offence, such as having killed an animal, or sold a cow 
or goat to a Musalm^n, or allowed an animal to be killed when he 
could have prevented it, he is fined by the assembled Bishnois for the 
good of the temple and the animals kept there. Another place of 
pilgrimage is a tomb called Chhambola in the Jodhpur country, where 
a festival is held once a year in Chet. There the pilgrims bathe ia 
the tank and help to deepen it, and sing and play musical instruments 
and scatter grain to peacocks and pigeons," 

The Bislinois look with special attention to the sacred /lom or sacrifice; 
it is only the rich who can perform this daily ; the poor meet together 



* But according to the Hissar Settlement Report, the ceremony of admission to the sect is 
as follows : — The priests and the people assemble together, repeat the pahul-mantar over a 
cup of water, and give it to the candidate to drink ; who thereafter goes round the assembly 
and bows to all. His head is then shaved after the mamier of the founder of the sect. 
According to his means he has to pay a certain sum of money (Rs. 5 to 500 is the limit), for 
the purpose of buying gram, which is then sent to the Samrathal sandhill in order to feed 
pigeons, 

t But in F^zilka the Bishnois are said to employ Brahmans for religious as well aB 
secuilar purposes. 



Il4 ' Bdchah — Bodla. 

to carry out the rite on the Amdvas day only. The gaenas or sddhs* 
who are their priests and are fed and feed by them Uke Brahmans, 
are a hereditary class and do not intermarry with other Bishnois, 
nor do they take offerings from any but Bishnois. The Bishnois 
themselves are a real caste and were shown as such in the Census 
tables ; and the returns of the caste are much more to be relied on than 
those of the sect, for the reason given above, that many Bishnois by 
sect must have been shown as Vaishnavas, and vice versa. It is said 
that a member of any of the higher Hindu castes may become a Bishnoi, 
but as a matter of fact they are almost entirely Jd,ts or Kh^tis (carpen- 
ters) or, less frequently, Rdjputs or Banias, and the Bd,nia Bishnois are 
apparently not found in the Punjab, their chief seat being Mur^ddbM, 
in the United Provinces. The man who becomes a Bishnoi is still 
bound by his caste restrictions ; he no longer calls himseK a Jd^, but 
he can marry only Jd,t Bishnois, or he is no longer a Khdti, and yet 
cannot marry any one who is not a Kh^ti ; and further than this, the 
Bishnoi retains the got of his original tribe and may not marry within 
it.f Karewa is practised among them, but an elder brother cannot 
marry a jounger brother's widow, though her brother-in-law or father- 
in-law are entitled, if she do not marry her dewar, to a payment called 
hhar from her second husband. 

There is not perhaps very much in the teaching of Jhdmbaji to 
distinguish him from the orthodox pattern of Hindu saints, and in some 
points his doctrine, more especially with regard to the preservation of 
life, is only an intensification of the ordinary Vaishnava tenets. But 
in the omission of the phera at marriage, the cutting off of the choti or 
scalp-lock, the special ceremony of initiation, and the disregard for 
the Brahmanicul priesthood, we find indications of the same spirit as 
that which moved the other Hmdu reformers of the period. 

BocHAH, a J^t clan (agricultural) in Multdu. 

Bodla. — The BodMs are a small section of the Wattu RijputsJ of the 
lower and middle Sutlej, who have for some generations enjoyed a 
character for peculiar sanctity, § and who now claim Qureshi origin 
from Abu Bakr Sadiq ; and many of them call theoiseives Qureshis. 
They still marry Wattu girls,- though they give their daughters only to 
Bodlds. They were till lately a wholly pastoral tribe, and still hold 
a jdgir, the proceeds of which they now supplement by cultivation. 
They came up from Multd,a through Bahawalpur to Montgomery, where 
they were described by Purser as " lazy, silly, and conceited/' From 
Montgomery they spread into Sirsa, where they occupied the Bahak 
pargana which they still hold. They are credited with the power of 
curing disease by exorcism, and especially snake-bite and hydrophobia; 
they are recognised samts, and can curse with great efficacy. They 
have no relations with the other Qureshis of the neighbourhood, and 

* According to the Hissar Settlement Report the sddhs are priests and the tha'jpun 
are secular clergy, generally elected by the people. Priesthood is not hereditary. In Fazilk4 
it is said that Bishnois never employ a Brahman if a Bhat is available. The Bhi.t too is a 
Bishnoi. 

t In F?izilka the Bishnois are said to have 1^60 divisions : one named Roja, meaning nilgai, 
but no reverence is paid to that animal by the Rojas. Cf. Goraya. 

X No Wattu would claim affinity with the Bodlas, who are held in great respect in Bikaner, 
as Parmeshicar ro sakko ro aakko, i.e., ' Xin of Uod's kith and kin.' The use of Parmeshwax 
for Allah points to a Hindu origin. 

§ Bodla in Western Punjabi means ' simpleton ', and simplicity or lunacy is regarded as 
asign of sanctity in the East.

their Wat^u origin is hereby open to question, though they may 
possibly be of Qureshi extraction, but now so completely affiliated to 
the Wattus by constantly taking brides from that tribo as to be undis- 
tinguishable from them. Their power of curing snake-bites is con- 
nected with a historical fact. When the Prophet and his companion 
Abu Bakar left Mecca, they concealed themselves in a cavern, and 
there the devoted companion, in order to protect his master, tore liis 
turban into rags and closed the holes with the pieces. One hole he 
stopped with his toe, and it was bitten by a snake. When the Prophet 
learnt what had occurred he cured it by sucking the wound, and the 
Sadiqis sometimes seek to prove their descent from the first Caliph 
by claiming the power of curing snake-bite. There is also said to be 
a class of wondering gharishti faqirs called Bodld,. A Sanidsi sub-sect 
also appears to bear this name. Possibly the word is confused with 
Bhola, 'simple', an epithet of MahMev. See also Qureshi. 
BoHEA. — The Bohrd includes two distinct classes : one Brahman money- 
lenders from Mdrwdr, who have settled in the districts on the Jumna, 
and acquired a most unenviable notoriety for unscrupulous rapacity. 
There is a rustic proverb : Bore kd Ram Ram aisd Jam ha sandesd : 
"A Bohrdi's 'good morning!' is like a message from the angel of 
death." These Bohras appear to accept brides from BcLnias, but do 
not give them daughters. 

In the hills any money-lender or shop-keeper is apparently called a 
hohrd (from the same root as beohdr ' trade '■^, and the word is used 
in the same general sense in the south of Rdjputdna and in Bombay, 
taking the place of the ' Biinia ' of Hindustan, though in Guzerat it is 
specially applied to a class of Shia traders who were converted to 
IsMm about 1300 A. D. [For the Mnhammadan Bora see Wilson's Sects 
of the Hindus, p. 170. They are represented in Multd,n.] In the Punjab 
all the Bohras are Hindus. In those Hill States in which Bohras are 
numerous, Banids are hardly represented in the returns, and vice versa ; 
and both the Bdnia and Boliia are in the liills also known as Mahd.ian. 
The Hill Bohrd,s are said to be exceedingly strict Hindus, and to be 
admitted to intermarriage with the lower classes of Rdjputs, such as 
Ei,this and Rd,wats. In Gurdd;spur there is said to be a small class 
of traders called Bohrds who claim Jd,t origin, and who are notorious for 
making money by marrying their daugrhters, securing the dower, and 
then running away with both, to begin again da capo.

Their ancestor is said to have been a disciple of Bahdwal Haqq and 
to have received from him some of the land granted to him by the

found in Bahdwalpur as landowners. The Bappis, with whom they 
intermarry, and Sangis are said to be of the same stock. 

BoT, an Arain clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery.

BozDAR, an independent Baloch tribe situated beyond our frontier at the 
back of the Kasrdni territory. They hold from the Sanghar Pass on 
the north to the Khosa and Khetrdn country on the south, and have 
the Luni and Musa Khel Pathdns on their western border. Those 
found in Dera Ghdzi Kh^n live in scattered villages about R^janpur 
and among the Laghdri tribe, and have no connection with the parent 
tribe. The Bozdd^r are hardly of Rind extraction seeing that their 
pedigree only makes them descendants of a goat-herd who married 
Bdno, widow of Rind's great-grandson, Shau Ali. They are divided 
into the Duldni, Ladwdni Ghuldm^ni, a suh-tuma7i, Chakrd,ni, Sihd,ni, 
Shd,hwdni, Jal^ldai, Jdfirdni and Rustamd,ni clans. They are more 
civilized than most of the trans-frontier tribes and are of all the Baloch 
the strictest Musalm^ns. Unlike all other Baloch they fight with the 
matchlock rather than with the sword. They are great graziers, and 
their name is said to be derived from the Persian buz, a goat. 

Brahman, (Panjdbi Bdmhan, Bahman; fern. Bd,mhani: dim. masc, Bamhanetd j 
fern. Bamhaneti, a Brahman's son or daughter : cf. Bamhanau, Brahman- 
hood). 

The Brahmans in India are divided into two great geographical 
groups, the Utrahak, who live to the north of the Vindhias, and the 
Uakshnat, who inhabit peninsular India to the south of that range. 
The former are further divided into 5 groups, viz. — 

1. S^raswat, (modernised Sdrsut).! 

2. Kankubj. ( 

3. Gaur. ^Also called, collectively, Gaur, 

4. Utkal. I 

5. Maithal. J 

The southern groups* also number 5 and are : Darawar, Mahdrashtri, 
Borashat, or Karnfltik, Tailing and Gorjar.t Of these the only repre- 
sentative in the Punjab are the Pushkarnd Brahmans, who sprang 
from the Mah^rashtri group. t The mass of the Punjab Brahmans 

* Also called, collectively, Darawar, from the saint of that name. Another account says 
the Darawar comprise the Maharashtr, Tailing, Gurjar, Dakhshani and Indrik : (Amritsar). 

t Lest it be too hastily assumed that Gorjar, Gurjar or Gujar Brahmans have any 
connection with the Gujars, folk-etymology has suggested that the name is derived from 
gujjh, ' secrecy ', because their ancestor had once to conceal his faith. 

X But unlike the southern Brahmans the Pushkarnaa observe ghunghat (i. e„ their women 
veil their faces), but they have no garhlm dhan (pregnancy rite) and in other respects their 
customs are dissimilar.

are Sarsuts, but Gaurs are found in the eastern districts of the

community. Such are the Pushkarn^s, Muhials, described below, and 
the Bhojki, Dhakochi, Taqa and Tagu groups. 

The Pdshkaenas. 

It will be convenient to describe first the Pushkarnds, a comparatively 
small and unimportant group found only in the south-west of the 
Punjab. They are divided into two territorial groups, (i) Sindhu, " of 
the Indus valley," and (ii) Mdrwari, of Mdrwdr, or Marechd. 

The Pushkariids claim to be faroMts of all the 'Bhdt Rd,jputs ' who 
are divided into Bhdts, Bhattis and Bhdtid,s,* and are described by 
Ibbetson as more strict in caste matters than the Sd/rsut.

* Incidentally this indicates that the Bhattis and Bhiltias have a common origin — both 
come from the country to the south of the Punjab. There are said to be Bh4t Rijpata in 
Jaisalmir. 

t It is said that the Pushkarns used to be called Sri-Malis, that they rank below the 
Sarsut, Piirikh and Gaur sub-castes, and are (only) regarded as Brahmans because of their 
skill in astrology. But thoy are by origin possibly Sarsuts who made Pushkar or Pokhar, 
the sacred hike near Ajmer their head-quarters. One section of them is said to have been 
originally Beldars or Ods who were raised to Braluninical rank as a reward for excavating 
the tank and it still worships the pickaxe, but this tradition is not now current in the 
Punjab.

gots: Mattar and Wattu.^

which I cannot trace elsewhere. It has 6 gotsX : —

The Bkahmanical Hierarchy in the South-West Punjab. 

Before describing the Sdrsut Brahmans it will be best to describe 
the organisation of the Brahmanical heirarchy in the South-West 
Punjab, where the Sdrsuts aud Pushkarnds overlap, combining to 
form groups of beneficed and unbeneficed priests which are further 
attached to the different castes. 

The Wateshar. — The Wateshar§ are a group of Brahmans whose 
clientele is scattered, and who receive fixed dues from their patrons, 
irrespective of the services rendered to them. If they preside at a 
religious function they receive fixed fees in addition to their stand- 
ing dues. 

In Midnwdli the Wateshar class comprises the following sections 
of the Sarsutjl and Pushkamd; Brahmans : — 

T^u i. ( i. Kandiara. 

1. Dhajinanpotra ... J ^ Lain. 

* The Wattu 50* is the lowest of all: Brahmandn men Wattu, ghoron men tattii — "The 
Wattu among Brahmans is what a pony is among horses." 

I But towards Bikaner is a group known as Parik. 

J The sub- divisions of these sections are variously given thus : — 

f Ambruana, from Amar Nath, Rangild4si, from " Rangil 

Bhojipotra is said to include \ Dis," Wajal, from Wajalji, Tejal from Tejalji, all four 

i, ii and iii as in text and 1 with Ram Nand, Machhindraji and Bhara Mai, sons of 

C. Sidh Bojh, the saint and eponym of the section. 
This section also includes the Dand-dambh, the nick-name apparently of some family 
earnt by curing an ox, as the name implies. 

The Samapotra also in- ) the Kalkadasani, Prayagdasi, ^ and all six sub-divisions are 
eludes i and ii, as above with ) Prithwi Mai and Shamdasi S patronymic. 

The Samapotras are descended from Sidh Saman and perform a special worship on the 
Rikhipanchami, the 5th of the bright half of Bhadon. They also worship HingUj devi at 
births, weddings and on the 3rd of the bright half of Bais^kh.

v. Jan. 

For the correspondence between these sections and those of the Muhiil Brahmans see infra., 
§ It has been suggested that Wateshar is derived from hirt, ' dues.' It is doubtless the same' 
word as Vriteswar, derived homvritti or virat. and may be translated 'beneficed.' Thus the 
Wateshar form an occupational group and the description given of their sub-divisions is 
certainly not absolute. 

II Among the S4rsut Wateshar the matrimonial relations are complicated. The Sethpal 
marry with the Bhojipotra and Simepotra, if such alliances have been actually made in the 
past. If however they cannot obtain brides from these two sections they try to get them from 
the Bhardwaja or Kathpal. Agaia the Dhannanpotra only take brides from sections 
Nos. 2—4, but give none to them. Under these circumstances it is not surprising to learn 
that the Bhojipotra and Samepotra sections used till recently to practise female infanticide 
habitually. Lastly sections Nos, 5— 7 are willing to effect exchange betrothals with the 
Narainis, if no suitable match offers within this group of three sections, which intermarry. 
The Pushkami Wateshars also effect exchange betrothals as do the Shahri and Naraini.

Of the Siodhu-Pushkarnd, Wateshar the Nangu minister to the 
Gurmalia, Kaura, Gulati, Sadidev, Chikkar, Mungiya and Raon-khela 
and many other sections of the Aroras, and the Sajulia section of the 
Bhatids. The Lapiya minister to the Kharbanda, Chawala, Mongid, 
Karre, Khattar and Kalache gots, and the Parial to the Khera, Bugra 
and Khurana, all sections of the Arords. The Tanksali* minister 
to the Nangpal, Mutrija, Dua (Seth Hari) ; the M attar minister to the 
Khurana, all Sateja Aroras; the Gandhria to Mahesri Banias ; the 
Wasu to Bhatias ; the Wesa to Mahesri Banias and the Sohana to 
Bhiti^s. 

The Astri have fewer patrons than the Wateshar, and the clientele of 
each is confined to one place, where he resides. If a Wateshar is 
unable to officiate for a patron an Astri acts for him, receiving |ths of 
the fee, the balance of fths being handed over to the Wateshar. 

The Astri sections in Mid,nwali are — 

1. Ramdeh,t 2. Shason, 3. Bhaglal, 4. Ishwar, and 5. Dahiwdl. 

The Naraini is an immigrant group, and is thus without patrons, but 
if the Wateshar and Astri are illiterate, a literate Naraini is called 
in to perform any function requiring knowledge. As a rule, however, 
the Naraini only presents himself when alms are given to all and 
sundry.

Only a Brahman may be an astri, a parohit or a thdni. He may also 
oflSciate as an Acharaj, a Bhdt, a Gosd,in or a Ved-patr, (and so may any 
other Hindu), but if he does so he must not accept any dues for the rites 
performed. Only a Brahman can take sankalpa, no other Hindu.

The Skcular Brahmans. 

The Muhial Brahmans, — This group of secular Brahmans is said to 
derive its name from tmihin, a sum of money given by them at 
weddings to BhiUs and Jiljaks, varying from Rs. 5 to Rs, 7 or Rs. 12. 
The Muhid^ls are also styled Munlii'ils, and are said to be so called from 
tmihin, a sept. But it is also suggested that the name is derived from 
mukhia, 'spokesman,' or 'principal.' By origin the Muhiflls are cer- 
tainly Silrsuts and still take wives from that group in Gujrfit, while in 
Rilwalpindi the five superior sections (Sudhdn, Sikhan, BhaklAl, Bhog 
and IC4h) of the Bunjfihi Silrsuts used to give daughters to the Bhimwdl 
(Bhibhill) ' Muhiill Sarsuts' and occasionally to the other Muhiill 
sections, though they refused them to the inferior sections of the 
Bun]Yihis: Rawalpindi Gr. 1883-84, p. 51. 

Their organisation is on the usual principles and may be thus 
tabulated : —

The Bd.ri group either intermarries or takes daughters from the 
Bunjiihi, but the two sections of the latter (Lau and Bibhow^i) 
can only marry inter se.^ 



* The Bhats eulogise the Muhiiils in the following verses : — 

Daft data, Lau mangtd, \ ' The Datts are generous, and the Lau beggars, 

Cnhihhar wich Sardar. The Olihibbars are Sardirs. 

Walidn hath katariydn. The Haids dagger in hand

Mohan Bali chakddr. I Mohan and Bali are chakddrs. 

There are further sub-divisions, but among the Waid the Samba, among the Datt the 
Kanjruria, among the Bnli the Khara and among the Chhibbar the Barra, are considered 
superior clans.

The descendants of thefiveSidhs are further sob-divided into pdnchtoUas 
(wVio give their daughters not less than 5 tolas of gold as dowry) and 
tritoliyas (who give not less than 3). The latter rank below the former. 

The origin of the Mnhidls is thus desci ibed : In Sambat 200 
Vikrami the five Sidhs went to the Naunuthi Hill and there practised 
asceticism. About that time too the Khatris of the Aror family 
(now the Arords) and the other Khatris fell out, so the latter separated 
from the Aroras and became jajmdns of the Sidhs. The Muhidls 
who did not attacli themselves to the Aroras refused to accept alms 
(dan) and are still purely secular. They are found chiefly if not 
exclusively in Rd,walpindi (where many are Sikhs) ; in Jhelum and 
Shahpur as lanHholders or io service. All Muhidls may marry girls of 
Brahman families which are not Muhidl. 

A small group of secular Brahmans found at Harid^na, in 
Hoshidrpur is the Kanchan Kawal. They are also called Suraj Duaj 
(Sun- worshippers). Their ancestor came from Delhi as a hdnungo 
to Haridna, whence they are also called Kdnungos. They can marry 
in the ndnhd's got, avoiding only the father's got. They do not take 
charity {dan), and either take service or engage in trade or cultivation. 
If any one of them takes alms he is outcasted and they do not 
intermarry with him. 

Other purely lay groups of Brahmans are : the Dhakociii of the 
Dhund and Karral Hills in Hazara, who are also called Mahajans : the 
Tagas of Karnal, who are Gaurs by origin and agriculturists by avoca- 
tion : and the criminal Tagus of the same District. 

THE SARSUT BRAHMANS. 

The Sdrsut is essentially the Brahman of the Punjab, jast as the Khatri 

is distinctively a Punjab caste. The Sarsut, as a body, minister to all 

the Hindu castes, possibly even to those which are unclean and so stand 

outside the pale of Hinduism. Uoon this fact is based the leading 



Brahmans of the Rhatris. 123 

principle of their organization, which is that the status of each section 
depends on the status of the caste to whicli it tninistere. Inaccordanco 
with this principle, Ave may tentatively classify tlie iSdrsut thus : — 

Sub-group i. — Brahmans of Brahmans, called Sbukla. 

Sub-group ii. — -Bi-ahraans of theKhatris — 



5. Khokharan.* 
G. Sarin. 



1. Punch-zati. 4. Bunjahis. 

2. Chhe-zati. 3. As^th-bana. 

Sub-group uY. — Brahma tis of Arords. 

Sub-group iv. — Brahmans of Jdts. 

Sub-group v. — Brahmans of inferior castes, e.g., the Chamarwd. 

Further, each of the sub-groups is divided into grades on the analogy 
of the Khatri caste system thus — 

1. Panchzciti. 3. Butijahi. 

2. B^ri. 4. Inferior zdtL: 

Thus we may take the Shuklaf Brahmans to comprise the following 
gots : — 

fGallia ~1 ( Jetli. 

I Malia I I Jhing^n. ^ 

Pauchziti ...-j Kapuria ^ or < Mohla. 

Bhaturia I 1 Kumaria. 

t J I Trikha. 

The Sdj'sut Brcihinans of the Khatris. — The connection of the Khatri 
with the Sarsut Brnhman caste is peculiarly close. One tradition of its 
origin avers that when Parasu Rama was exterminating the K^hatriyas 
a pregnant woman of the caste took refuge with a Sdrsut. When her 
child, a son, was born, the Sarsut invested him Avith the janeo and 
taught him the Vedus. Hence the Sarsuts are invariably the parohits 
of the Kliatris, and fiom this incident arose the custom which allows 
paruhit Sindjajman to eat together. 

The boy manied 18 Kshatriya girls and his sons took the names of the 
various rishis and thus founded the gotras of the Khatrisj, which are the 
E.ame as those of the Brahmans. Tliis legend explains many points in 
the organization of the Sdrsut Brahmans in thn Punjab, though it is 
doubtless entirely mythical, having been intended to account for the close 
dependence of the Brahmans of the Sarsut branch on the Khatri caste. 

Gtoup I. — Panjzati i. At the top of the social tree stand five sections, 

. ,, , ,„ -v which are the parohits of tlie Dhaigrhar 

1. Monia. 1 t/-i j^ ' rrn • • ^ ■ ° 1

3. Jhingan. |^ Group Panjzati or Panjzati or ' five sections,' and also as 
*■ Kumada J P^^l^^^^^^'- Pachhdda or ' western.' Ii the Brah- 
mans followed the Khatri organization 

in all its complexity we should expect to find these sections constituting 
the Plidighar sub-group of a Bdri j^roup, and they are, \i would seem^ 
called phaighar-Lah(n-ia, at least in Lahore. 

There are'also said to be two groups, each oibzdtif<, which once formed 
themselves into endogamous cliques. These were : {i) Kalia, Malia, Bhaturia, 

* Probably this is correct. The Muhial having ceased to be Brahmans at all, no longer 
minister to tha Khokharan-Khatris and so a special group of Khokharan-Brahmans haa had 
lobe formed. 

t The Shuklas are beggars, who come from the east, from the direction of the United 
Provinces. They beg only from Brahmans, but arc not their parohits. They are quite 
distinct from the Shukal of the Simla llills.

Punbu.ll The last-named got was, however, replaced by the Mohlas^ be- 
cause one of its members was discourteous to his daughter-in-law's people. 

The Bari group further, in addition to tlie Panchzdtis, comprises the 
following 7 gots : Paumbu, Gangd;har,*=» ]\lartha, Sethi Churavaur, 
Phiranda and Purang. 

Group II. — Bunj^hi. This group contains several sub-groups whose 
relations to one another are obscure, and indeed the subject of con- 
troversy. They may be classified, tentatively, as follows :— -

• Jhingan is said to be derived from j/uVigra or ;^«jyV!., a bell, because the sound of a bell 
was heard at its eponj^m's birth. This got is supposed to be only 20 generations old. 
It has three sub-sections, Gautam, Athu and Nathu. Further, Nathu's descendants are sub- 
divided into the less known sub-divisions of Cbamnapati and Kanwlapati. The Jhingans 
gotra is Bhardwaj ; iheir pur vur as Bhrign, Bharjan and Bhardv/aj, their slidkhd Madhunjan 
and the Rig Veda their veda. At Dipalpur at the house of an ancestor, Baba Chhajjil, they 
hold a fair in Magh, at which the cliUa, jhand, janeo and other rites are performed. Nathu's 
descendants all wear a noth in the nose. 

t Trikha's gotra is Farashar and it is sub-divided into the Palwarda, Aura and Dwija 
bub- sections. 

t The Jetli !7o^ra is Vatsa, and its sub- sections are Vialepotra, Chandipotra, and Rupe- 
potra — all eponymous. The two former are replaced by Hathila and Harnpotra, according 
to another account. The Mihrotra Khatris make them ofierings on the 12th of the light 
half of each lunar month. 

§ The Kumbria gotra is also Vatsa and they too have three sub-sections. 

II Apparently the same as the Paumbu. below. 

*|[Lhe Mohlas gotra is Somastam, audits sub-sections are Dalwali, Shiv-Nandi and Akashi. 

*" Of the Vasiaht gotra. They have five sub-sections, Veda Vyas, Gacgahar {sic), 
Gosain, Saraph, and Gangawa&hi, so-called because they used to lead bands of 
pilgrims to the Ganges. They were exempt from tolls under former governments. 
The Sar4ph (Sarraf) were bankers. The Gosains had many jajmdns and the Veda 
Vyas were learned in the Vedas. 'the Gangahars still perform their jhand or tonsure rite 
near the ruins of old Jhang, near which town they possessed a number of wells, each 
inscribed with their names. 

■ft Or Tawaria. At marriage they do not let the bride go to her father-in law's house, 
but send instead a big gur cake wrapped in red cloth. If however the mukldwd ceremony is 
performed at the same time us the wedding, they let the bride go also, otherwise they sen4^ 
her afterwards when her mulddud is given. 

+1 Probably the same ;isthe Bhabakkar, a. got named after a llishi. Its members make 
a boy don the janeo (sacred thread) in his 8th j'ear. Clad as a sddhu in a faqirs dress with 
the alfi or chola, the mirg-chhdla (deer-skin) and kachkol (a wallet for collecting alms) he 
begs from door to door and is then bidden to go to the forest, Lut his sister brings him 
back. 



Brahmans of the Ehatrts. 125 

The Zdt-wdle : — 

Sith-group Hi. — Panj-zati ii. About 116 years ago the Brahicans 
of the five sections below used to give their daughters in marriage to 
the Dhdighar- Lahoria Brahmans ; — 

(1) Kalie. I (3) Kapurie. I (5) Eaggo. 

(2) Malie. I (4) Bhaturie. | 

When their daughters ' began to be treated harshly in the houses of 
tlieir fathers-in-law, these Bralimans {i-)anjzatov five sections) arranged 
to contract marriages only among themselves ' and ceased to form re- 
lationships with the Dhaighar-Lahoria. 

Sub-group iv.- — ChheZcit-wala. — Similarly several other sections of 
Brahmans gave up giving daughters to the Dbaighar-Lahoria Brah- 
mans, such as— 

(1) Pandit. I (3) Dhniide. ( (5) Dhan Kaji. 

(2) Patak. I (4) Gadhari. I (6; Chhukari. 

Stib -group v. — Panchzdt-w^le iii — 

(1) Chuni. I (3) Lamb. I (5) Sarballie. 

(2) Rabri. I (4) Neule. * 

Suh-group vi. — Sat-zdti — 

(1) Sajre. (4) Neasi. j (6) Sardal. 

(2) Punj. (5) Chujii. (7) Anni. 

(3) Bandu, ' 

The above four sub-groups are called collectively Zat-wale, 

Suh-group vii. — This comprises the remaining Bunjdhi sections. 

The Zd,t-wd,Ie stand higher than this last sub-group vii, in that 
they do not accept offerings from, or eat in the houses of, Ndis, 
Kaldls, Kumhdrs or C'hhimbjis, whereas the latter do both. Moreover, 
the Asht-bans and Chhe-zdti sub-groups claim to be superior in status 
to the B^ris, but some families of these two sub-groups stooped to 
give daughters to the latter sub-group, and were, therefore, excom- 
municated by the remaining families of the Asht-bans and Chhe-zati 
sub-groups, so that they lost status and formed a new sub-group called 
Bans-puj. This sub-group now gives daughters to the Asht-bans and 
Chhe-zati sub-groups, but takes its wives, it is alleged, from the B^ris. 

Thus the Brahman organization reflects the main outlines of the 
Khatri scheme, but, thougli on many points of detail our information 
is incomplete, it is certain that local conditions modify the organiza- 
tion. For instance in Bahd-walpur the Khatris are few, while the 
Aroras are numerous aud infiuential, so that we find the following 
scheme : — 

Sub-group i. — Five sections, Mohla, Jetli, Jhingran, Trikha, 
Kumaria. 

Hyper gamous sub-group ii. — Five sections, Dhaman-potra, Sama- 
potra, Bhoja-potra, Setpal, Takht-Lalhdri ; and 

fJypergamous sub-group m.— Seven sections, Lai hd,ri, Bias, Kandaria, 
Kathpala, Shangru-potra or "Wed, Malakpura, and Bhenda. 

Of these three sub-groups, the five sections of the first are Brah- 
mans of the Khatris generally, not of the Dhdighar-Bdri Khatri9 
exclusively, while sub-groups ii and iii are Brahmans of the Arorfie 
in that part of the Punjab. 



126 Brahmans of the Khatris. 

The rules of marriage. — Like the Khatris, the Bunjdhi Brahmans 
profess to folJow the usual ' ionr-got ' rule in marriage, but, precisely 
like the Dhiiighar Khatris, the Zd-t-wale Brahmans avoid only their 
own section and the mother's relations. At least this appears to 
be the usual rule, but it would be rash to say it is an invariable 
one. For example, the B;ins-puj are an exception. The Asht-bans 
obtain wives from them, but if a father has taken a Bans-puj wife, 
the son may not : he must marry an Asht-bans or lose status. That 
is to say, the Asht-bans may only stoop to iuter-marriHge with the 
Bans-puj in alternate generations. 

Similarly the ' ionr-got ' rule is relaxed in other cases. Thus the 
Kanchan-Kamal section of Hoshiarpnr are also called Suraj Doaj, 
(Sun-worshippers). Their ancestor came from Delhi as a qdnungo 
at Haridna ; hence they are called Qanungos. These Brahmans can 
marry in the ndnka got, avoiding only the father's got. They do not 
take any dan (charity) and may either take service or engage in trade 
or cultivation. If any one of them takes to receiving charity, he is 
considered an outcast! and they do not intermalrry with him. 

The ages of marriage. — Among the Bunjahi Brahmans the age of 
betrothal is from 4-8 and that of marriage from 8-12 years in 
Rawalpindi. It is, however, impossible to lay down any universal 
rules, as, generally speaking, the ages of betrothal and marriage 
depend upon the status of each family within the group, as is the 
case among the Khatris. 

The revolt against hypergamy. — It will be seen how the lower sub- 
groups of the Khatris have endeavoured to shake off the yoke of the 
higher in matrimonial matters. A similar revolt against the position 
of the JDhd-ighar occurred amongst the Sarsut Brahmans. About 116 
years ago, says the account received from Areritsar, the Lahoria 
Pbdighar used to take daughters from the Panj-zat ii; but owing to 
the ill-treatment meted out to the girh by the phd.iKhHr, they resolv- 
ed to discontinue the custom, aud the three other groups of the Zat- 
wdle followed suit while the remaining Bunjahis continued to give 
wives to the Zdfc-wale, but no longer received them in return. The 
result was that the Bunjahis could not obtain wives and many fami- 
lies died out, so it was resolved by the Bunjahis that they should for 
the future break off all connection with the Zat-wdle, unless any of the 
latter should agree to give them daughters in return. This was prior to 
Sambat 1932 when a second meeting at Amritsar renewed the compact. 

It may be worth noting that in both castes the proceedings of 
these conferences were conducted in a formal manner, written agree- 
ments being drawn up, and the families which agreed to the de- 
mands put forward being entered in a register from time to time. 

The territorial groups. — Like the Khatris the Brahmans have terri- 
torial groups, but these groups do not usually correspond with the 
territorial groups of the former. For instance, the Brahmans of the 
Murree Hills are divided into two sub-castes-^ Pahdria and Dhakochi, 
who do not interman-y or eat together. The Dugri Brahmans corre- 
spond to the Dugri Khatris of the Si^lkot sub -montane, but they are 
said, on the one hand, to give daughters to the Sarsut, aud, on the

other liand, to intermarry with the Batehru group of Brahmans in 
Kangra. Allusions have been already made to tlie Paclibflda and' to 
the Laboria, terms which seem to be applied exclusively to the five 
highest sectior-s who serve the Dhdighar Khatris. 

The Sarsdt Brahmans op the ArorAs. 

The gfrouping of the Brahmans of the Aroriis has already been des- 
cribed iu dealing with the Wateshars' system, and they further are said 
to be thus divided : 

Panch-z^ti 



Biri 



But the most interesting territorial group of the Sdrsut is that of 
the Kd,ngra Brahmans whose organization shows no traces of the 
Khatri scheme, but reflects that of the Hindu Rajputs of Kilngra, and 
which will, therefore, be described at some length. 

The Brahmans op Kang^a. 

The Sarsut des or jurisdiction extends from the Saraswati river in 
Kurukshetr to Attock on the Indus and is bounded by Pehowa on the 
east, by Ratia and Fafehdbad in Hissar, by Multan on the south-west, 
and by Jammu and Nurpur, in Kangra, on the north. 

Thus the Brahmans of Kangra, who are or claim to be Sdrsut by 
origin, stand beyond the pale of the Sarsut organisation, but they 
have a very interesting organisation of their own. 

We];find the following groups : — 

i. — Nagarkotia. 
ii. — Batehru. 
iii, — Halbaha, or cultivating. 

Group I. — ^The Nagarkotia are the Brahmans of the Katoch, the 
highest of the Rdjputs, and they were divided by Dharm Chand, the 
Katoch Raja of Kdngra, into 13 functional sub-groups, each named 
ft; er the duties it performed in his time. These are — 

i. — Dichhit, the Gurus of the Katoch, who used to teach the Gayatri 
mantra. 

ii.— Sarotari, said to be from Sanskrit saw ladh. Their duty was 
to pour alioii or offerings of ghi, etc., into the hawan kund 
when a jag was performed. They had learnt two Vedas. 

iii.— Achdria, who performed the jag. 



* The Lalri have five sab-sectiona :-Lal Lalri, Viaa Lnlri, Takht Lalri, Ghauijal 
Lalri and Raj Bakht or Jan. 

t By ffofra Shamundal, the Kathpdlaa have fonr sab- sections, Surangu, Sidha, Gilkala 
and Fathak. 



128 The Brahmans of Kdngra. 

iy. — Upadbyaya, or TJpadlii,* or ' readers ' of the Vedas at the jag. 
V. — Awasthi, those who ' stood by ' the Icalas or pitcher at the Muni- 
pursh, and who received the pitcher and other articles (of 
sacrifice). 

vi. — Bed birch, who made the hedi, or square demarcated by four 
sticks in which the halas was placed. 

Yii. — N^o- Pundrik, whose duty it was to write the prescribed in- 
scriptions on the hawan Jcund. 

viii. — Panchkarn or secular Brahmana engaged in service on the 
Rajds. They performed j^t-e out of the six duties of Brah- 
mans, but not the sixth, which is the receiving of alms. 

ix. — Parohits, who were admitted to the seraglio of the Raja and 

were his most loyal adherents. 
X. — ^Kashmiri Pandit, literate Brahmans from Kashmir, who are 
found all over the Punjab. 

xi. — Misr,t said to mean ' mixed,' also Kashmiri immigrants, who had 
preserved their own customs and rites, but had intermarried 
with the Nagarkotia. 

xii. -Kaina, who helped the rulers by their incantations in time of 

war. (Said to be from ran, battle-field.) 

xiii. — Bip (Bipr), now extinct in Kdngra, These were parohits of 
the Nagarkotia and of some of the Batehru, 

Of these 13 sub-groups numbers x and xi seem to be territorial 
rather than functional. One cannot say what their relative rank 
is or was. The first six are also called the six Achdrias and were 
probably temple priests or menials of inferior status. The Bip pro- 
bably ranked high, and the Raiua, or magic men, were possibly the 
lowest of all. The Khappari are also said to be found in Kaiigra, but, 
no account from that District alludes to them. 

Group II. — Batehru. — There are two sub-groups— 
i, — Pakkd Batehru. — With 9 sections— 

(1) Dind, (2) Dohru, (3) Sintu, (4) Pallialu, (5) Panbar, 
(6) Rukkhe, (7) Ndg-Kharappe, (8) Awasthi-Chetu and 
(9) Misr-Kathu. 



* But apadhi is in Orissa translated ' title.' Vide Tribes and Castes of Bengal, I, p. 161. 
Upadhyayais, correctly speaking, qnite distinct from Upadhi. 

t It will be observed that the Misr (section) occurs in both the Batehru snb-gronps 
and among the Nagarkotia, so that we have three sub-sections — 

(1) Kasbmiri-Misr, Nagarkotia. 

(2) Kathu-Misr. Patka Batehru. 

(3) Mali-Misr, Kachcha Batehru. 

Of these the last named are parohits of the Kashmiri Pandits, the Kashrairi-Miara and 
the Rainas. 

The Nag (? section) are also thus found, for we have — 

(1) Nag-Pandrik, Nagarkotia, 

(2) Nag-Kharappa, Fakka Batehru. 

(3) Nag-GosaUi, Kachcha Batehru. 

It is explained that Kharappa (cobra) and Gosalu (? grass-snake) are nicknames im- 
pljit.g contempt, as these sub-aections are of low status. But a comparison with the 
Brahmans of Ur'issa suggests a totemistic origin for those sections : V. Tribes and Castes 
of Bengal, I, p. 161. 

The Awasthi too are found in all three groupa. 



The Brahmans of Kangra, i20 

ii. — Kachchd Batehru. — With 13 sections — 

(1) Tagnet, (2) Gbabru, (3) Suglie (Parsr^mio), (4) Chnp]ial, 
(5) Chatlivvan, ((3) Awasthi-Tliirkanun, (7) Awasthi- 
Gargajnun, (8; Ghogare, (9) Nag-Gosaiu, (10) Mali-Misr, 
(11) Acluiriapathiarj, (12) Pandit Bariswal and (13) 
Awasthi-Kuiarial. 

Group III. — Halbalia. — The Halbahas have 29 got.s or sections : — 
(J) Pandit-Marchu, (2) Bhntwan, (3) Khurwal, (4) Gidgidie, 
(5) Lade, (6) Pahde-Koptn, (7) Pahde-Saroch, (8) Korle, 
(9) Awasthi-Chakolu, (10) Pandit-Bhangalie, (II) Narchalu, 
(12) Mahte, (13) Diikwal, (14) Saiihalu, (15) Pahde-Daroch, 
(16) Pandore, (17) Thenk, (18) Pahde-Kotlerie, (19) Bngheru, 
(20) Bhaiiwal, (21) Bashist, (22) Ghutanie, (23) Mir.dhe- 
Awasthi, (24) Prohit-Golerie, (25) Prohit-Jaswal, (26) Hasolar, 
(27) Poi-Pahde, (28) Faiiarach and (29) Pharerie. 

Of these the first fourteen now intermarry with the Batehru, giving, 

and, apparently, receiving wives on equal terms. 

Hijpergamy. — The Nagarkotia take brides from both sub-groups 
of the Batehru, and th^y have, since Sambat 191 J, also taken brides 
from the Halbaha. The Batehru take wives from all the sections 
ot the Halbaha. When a Halbaha girl marries a Nngarkotia, she is 
seated in the highest place at marriage-feasts by the women of her hus- 
band's brotherhood. This ceremony is called sara-dena and implies 
that the Halbaha bride has beconio of the same social status as the hus- 
band's kin. Money is never paid for a bri-ie. Indited Barnes observed : — 

" So far do the Nagarkotias carry their scruples to exonerate tho bridegi'oom from all 
expense, that they refuse to partake of any hospitality at the hands of the son-in-law, aud 
will not even drink water in the village where he resides.'' 

Social relations. — The accounts vary and tho customs have, it is 
explicitly stated, been modified quite recently. The Nagarkotia 
may eat with Batehrus and have even began to eat 'kachlii from 
the hands of a Halbaha according to one account. According to 
another this is not so, and a Nagarkotia who has married a Halbaha 
girl may not eat at all from the hands of his wife until she has 
borne at least one child, when the prohibition is said to be removed. 

The Batehru and Halbaha section names. — These show an extraor- 
dinary jumble of Brahminical gotras {e.g., Bashist.), functional and 
other names, so that the accuracy of the lists is open to doubt. 
It appears certain, however, that some of the sections are named 
from the tribes to whom they minister. Thus, we may assume, the 
Pahda-Kotleria are Pahdas of the Kotleria Kiliputs ; the Parohit- 
Goleria and Parohit-Jaswal to be jiarohits of the Goleria and Jaswal 
Riljputs, and so on. This is in accord with the system, which has been 
found to exist among the Sd,rsut of the plain?, whereby the Brahman 
takes his status from that of the section to which he ministers. But 
status is also determined by occupation. Like tlie Gaddis and Ghirths 
of the KAngra and Chamba hills the Brahmans of Kdngrabave numerous 
als with vaguely totemisLic * names. Thus among the Nagarkotia the 



* In Hiflsar there is a section of Br&hmanH, called Bh^da or sheep- This is interesting', 
because on the Sutlej, at least in Kulla Sarilj, there is a small caste called Bb^hv, who are 
hereditary victims in the sacriiicial riding of a rope down the cliffs to tho rirer. Other* 



130 The BraJimans of Kdngra, 

Pakkd Bateliru have tlie section called Kharappd, (or cobra) Ndg and the 
Kaclichd Batehru, a section styled Ghoslu (a species of fish or possibly 
grass-snake) Nilg. Pundrik also appears to be a snake section. These 
snake sections are said to reverence the snake after which they are 
named and not to kill or injure it. 

In addition to these, the Batehrn (Pakka and Kachchd.) have the 
following sections : — 

(i) Chappal, an insect ; no explanation is forthcoming. 

(ii) Sugga, a parrot ; no exi^lanation is forthcoming, 
(iii) Bhangwaria, fr. bhdngar, a kind of tree. 

(iv) KhaJTire Dogre : Date-palm Dogra, a section founded by a man who planted a gar- 
den of date-palms, and which originated in the Dogra countiy on the borders of Jammu. 

^v^ Ghabru, a rascal ; one who earns his living by fair means or foul. 

In the Chaniba State the Brahmans form an agricultural class, 
as well as a hierarchy. Those in the capital are employed in the 
service of the State or engaged in trade, while others are very poor 
and eke out a living as priests in the temples, or as parohits and even 
as cooks, but they abstain from all manual labour. Strict in caste ob- 
servances they preserve the ancient Brahmanical gotras, but are divided 
into numerous als which form three groups : — 

Group I. — AU : Baru, Banbaru, Pandit, Sanju, Kashmiri Pandit, Kolue,* Baid, Gautaman, 
Bugalan, Atan, Madyan.f Kanwan, Bodhran, Baludran, Bilparu, Mangleru, Lakhyinu, 
Suhklu, Nunyal, Nonyal, Sungl^l, Bhararu, Turnal, Haryan^, and Purohit. 

Group II. — Als : Chhunphanan, Thulyan, Dikhchat, Osti, Pads, Bhat, Dogre, Pantu, 
Kuthla, Ghoretu, Pathania, Myandhialu, Mangleru, Katochu, Pande, Datwan, Dundie, 
Hamlogu, Bhardiathu, Gharthalu, Hanthalu, Gwaru, Chibar, Barare, and Datt. 

Group III. — Als: Acharaj, Gujrati, Gwalhu and BujUru." 

The first group only takes wives from the second, and the first two 
groups have m caste relations with the third. The Brahmans of 
Chaniba town and Sungal§ disavow all caste connection with the 
halbdh or cultivating Brahmans who are hardly to be distinguished 
from the general rural population, though many act as priests at the 
viUage shrines and as iiurohits. Many Brahmans are in possession of 
sdsans or grants of land recorded on copper plates. The hill Brahmans, 
both men and women, eat meat, in marked contrast to those of the 
plains. In the Pangi wizdrat of the Chamba State Brahmans, Rajputs, 
Thdkurs and Rath is form one caste, without restrictions on food or 
marriage. In the Rd^vi valley, especially in Church, and to a less degree 
in Biahmaur also, free marriage relations exist among the high castes, 
good families excepted. But in recent years there has been a tendency 
towards greater strictness in the observance of caste rules. H 



wise traces of totemism are very rare among the Brahmans of the plains, though in the 
Bub-montane district of Ambala two are noted. These are the Pila Bheddi or 'yellow 
wolve^',' so called because one of tlieir ancestors was saved by a she-Wolf and so they now 
worship a wolf at weddings ; and Sarinhe, who are said to have once takf^n refuge under a 
sari7i tree and now revere it. 

* From Kullii, so called because they came with an idol from that country. They are 
priests of the Lakshmi Narain, Damodar and Radha Krishna temples. 

t The Kanwan are descendants of the Brahman family from which Raja Sahila Varma 
of Chamba purchased the site of the present capital. 

X The Ilaryan are in charge of the Hari Rai temple. 

§ The ancient Sumangala. a village noAv held entirely by Brahmans under a fdsan grant 
of the If'th century A.D They are descended from two immigrants, a Brahmachari and his 
rhe'a, from the Kurukshetra. The two families intermarry and also give daughters to the 
Brahmans of Chamba town.

The Brahmans round Simla. 131 

The Brahmans op the low castes. 

As we have seen the Bralimans of the higher castes form a scries 
of groups whoso status depends on that of their cHcnts. On a 
similar principle the Brahmans of the castes which are unclean 
and so outside the pale of Hindiiisui form distinct sub-castes outside 
the circle of those who minister to the higher castes. 

These sub-castes are— 

I. — The Chamarwd. — The Brahmans of the Chanor sub-caste of 
the Chamdrs. 

II. — Dhanakwa.~The Brahmans of the Dhdnaks or Hindu weavers 
in Rohtak. 

III. — The Brahmans of Chiihr.'is. 

Each of these three sub-castes appears to be now strictly endogamous, 
though the Chamarwa are said to have until recently intermarried 
with Chamiii'S. However, it seems clear that they do not intermarry 
with the other Sdrsut Brahmans if indeel they have any claim to 
Silrsat ancestry. No Charaarwa Brahraaa may enter a Hindu's house. 
According to a tale told in Amh^Xa, the origin of the Chamarwa 
Brahmans was this : — A Brahman, on his way to the Ganges to bathe, 
met> Ram Das, tlip famous CliHtnar hliagat. Ram Das gave him two 
coteries and told him to present them to Gangaji (Gangos), if she held 
out her hand for them. She did so, and in return gave him two hangans 
(bracelets). The Brahmnn went back to Ram Das, who asked him 
what the goddess had given him, and he, intending to keep one of the 
two hangans, said she had given one only; but when he looked for them 
they were not on his own body, but in the kiinda (breechea) of Ram 
Das. Ram Das then gave him the bracelets and warned the Brahman 
in future to accept gifts only from his descend ants, otherwise great 
misfortune would befall him. Accordingly his descendants only serve 
Chamars to this day. The Chamarwa are only iiaroliits of theChamars, 
not gurus. They must not be confounded with the masands who act as 
their guriis, though either a Chamarwa Brahman or a (Chamar) mnsand 
can preside at a Chamar's wedding. It is said that tlie Chamarwa is 
also called a Husaini Brahman. 

The Brahmans in the Simla Hills. 
North and east of Simla the Brahmans both Gaur and Sdrsut have 
three groups : Shukal, Krishan and Pujdri or Bhojgi, the two latter 
equal but inferior to the first. The Shukal are further divided into 
two occupational groups (i) tlioso who hold /ay/r^^ granted by chiefs 
and who receive ample dues and (ii) those Tvho receive little in fees. 
The former are generally literate and do not cultivate: they observe 
the rites prescribed by the ShAstras. The latter ai'e mainly agricul- 
turists and practise informal as well as formal marriage and even 
polyandry. The former take wives from the latter, hut do not give 
them. The Shukal gi'oup does not intermarry with the other two*. 

The Krishan Brahmans are also cnltivatf)rs and accept {dmost any 
alms. They also practise widow remarriage and the rit custom. The 



* The Shukal are not stated to correspond to the Shukia, or to le Brahmans to Brahmaca 
only. 



132 Brahmans degraded hy function. 

Pujdris or Bliojgis are temple-priests or chelas of a god. They appear 
to have only recently become a distinct group. Some are merely 'pujaris 
and accept no alms living by cultivation. These do not intermarry with 
the Krishan Brahmans. Others accept alma in the name of a deceased 
person and use the ghi with which idols are besmeared in Mdgh, They 
intermarry with the Krishan group. 

When Paras Ram* a Gaur Brahman overthrew theRdjputs the Sdrsuta 
protected those oi: their women who survived and when the Rdjputs 
regained power they replaced the Gaurs by Sdrsuts. Parns Ram had 
extended his conquests as far as Nirmand in the Sard,] tahsil of Kullu and 
there he established a colony of Gaur Brahmans in 6 villages, still held 
in mucifi by them. These colonists are now spread over Bashahr, Kulld, 
Sard] and Suket, and they are called Palsrdmi or Parasrdmi to this day. 

Both the Gaur and Sarsuts are also cross-divided into the Sasani, or 
beneficed, and Dharowar groups.t The former are priests or parohits 
oi the ruling families, being supported by the rents of their lands and 
the dues received from their clients. The latter live by cultivation, but 
do not hold revenue-free grants. Neither group accepts alms given to 
avert the evil influence of certain planets or offered during an echpse.J 

The Impuee Brahmans. 

We now come to deal with the groups of Brahmans who exercise 
degraded or spiritually dangerous functions. In contradistinction to 
the uttam or 'pure' Brahmans discussed above — Brahmans who serve 
pure castes and fulfil pure functions — we fiud groups of Brahmans who 
exercise impure or inauspicious functions. These groups are known 
by various names, but in some parts of the Punjab, e.g., in Midnwdli, 
they are divided into two classes, the Madham. Mahd-Brahman or 
Acharaj, and the Kanisht. The Madham form a kind of * middle ' class, 
performing functions which though unlucky and even unclean, are 
ritualistic. The Kanisht on the other hand are minor priests, whose 
rites are Lirgely magical, rather than religious; and they include such 
groups as the Ved-patr, Dakaut and Sawani. 

* The tradition begins by asserting that the Gaur accompanied the Rajputs from the 
plains, and that the latter usurped the Gaur's power. 'Ihey then made the Gaurs their 
parohits, but annexed their principalities. Later Kankubj and Maithila Brahmans 
accompanied those Rajputs who escaped from the plains after the Muhammadan invasions 
and found a refuge in the hills. 

t The Dharowar intermarry with the Krishan Rrahmans of the Hills, and give daughters 
to the Sasani and Shukal groups, but not to the Krishan group. 

J Jt must not be iuiagined that this description exhaut^ts the ramifications of the Bill 
Bra^|^lJ^ns. Ihns in Kumi.aisain we learn tliat there are Sar^iut Brahmans, Jhakbrii by 
family, descended from Gautama rislii, aud other families descended from BLardwaj 
rishi. These bitter came, some from Ka^hi, others from Sitidh, and they intermarry intei' 
se or with Bhardwaj Brahmans settled in Basbahr. They worship Brahma, as well as 
VishTiu, Mahe»h and the 10 incarnations. These Bhardwaj, wtio are known as the four 
Bri.hnian foZs, will not iniei marry with a cliss of Brahmans called Paochi, because the 
latter have stooped to widow vemarrinfie. Y(4 the Paochi is not the lowest group, for 
below it are the Pujaras, J.lso Sarmits wearing the jnnco, and affecting the various hill 
rZeoids, of whose lands they aio mostly hereditary tenants. Pujaras permit the bedani 
form of marriage, and also the rit syttem which is in vogue among the Kanets of the 
Simla Hills. They can also eat from a KaneL's hands, but Paochi Brahmans will not eat 
from theirs. The Pujaras are numerous and fairly widespread from Suket to Keonthal 
and Bashabr, giving their name to one Pujarli village in the last-named State, and to 
tinotber in Balsan, 



Brahmans degraded hy function, 183 

The Maha-Brahman or Acharaj. 

MaM-Brahman is usually said to be synonymous with Aclidraj, but 
strictly speaking, tlio Malia-Bralimans appear to be a Pub-division of 
the Garagacli^ra]* or Acharaj. They are themselves divided into two 
groups, (jarg and Sonana. On the other hand in Kangra the Achilraja 
is said to bo one of the two groups of Mahd-Bralimans. 

Of these the Dikhat has the following sections : — 

1, Josi. 3. Sonami. 5. Tamnaj-at. 

2. Kandarf. 4. Sutrak. 

The Mahd,-Brahmans are endogamoug. They give alms in the name 
of the dead after death to Sanidsis, or occasionally to a daughter's 
father-iu-law. The Brahmans do not receive anything in return for 
performance of marriage ceremonies. 

In Kdngra they (and the Sdwanis) are said to have the Bd,ri and Bun- 
jdhi groups, and this is also tlie case in Midnwdli. in Kangra the Acha- 
raj gots are — 

Asil. Baclas, Parasar. Sandal. 

A noteworthy offshoot of the Acharaj are the Par-acharajt, or 
Mahd-achilraj as they are called in Amritsar,J who accept those gifts 
from the Acharaj which the Achdraj themselves take from other 
Hindus after death. 

The function of the Mahd-Brahman or Achd,raj is to accept the 
offerings made after a death in the name of the deceased. Originally 
the term acharija meant simply a guide or teacher in matters spiritual, § 
and the process whereby it has come to denote a great sub-caste of 
* sin-eating' Brahmans isi obscure. As a body the Ach^iryas trace 
their origin to the 5 Gaurs and the 5 Dariiwars, asserting that thoso 
who accepted offerings made within 13 dayf^H of a death were excom- 
municated by the other Brahmans and formed a sub-caste. As the 
only occasion on which an Achdrya visits a house is at or after a death 
his advent is naturally inauspicious, and his touch is pollution. After 
he has quitted the house water is scattered on the fluor to avert ' the 
burning presence of death,* and, io Kangra and Multtin, villao-ers 
throw charcoal, etc., after him. In the Simla hills the Mahii-acharai 
occupies a special position. He is the ■paroliU of the I<ino-, chief or 
wealthy people and represents the dead man and as his substitute is 
fed sumptuously for a whole year by the kin. In some places he even 
takes food from the hand of the corpse on the pyre, but this custom 
is dying out and it now suffices to bribe the Mahd-achdraj to eat to his 
utmost capacity, tlie idea being that the more ho eats the better it will

be for the soul.* Ordinary people, however, only feed an Ach^raj for 
13 days after a death, but Brahmans also receive food for the dead 
occasionally after that period. 

The j^ch^raj, however, also officiates as a Wateshar in death 
observances. 

The Dakaut Bkahmans. 

The Dakaut or Dak-putra derives his name from jpaka,t a Brahman 
who founded the caste. Once on his way to the Ganges, Bhadli, a 
Kumhdrni,J persuaded him to bathe instead in a pond, professing that 
she could get him bathed there in the Ganges. As soon as be 
touched the water he found himself by her enchantment in the river, 
so he made her his wife. Here we have an obvious allegory. 

A Dakaut of Midnwdli gives another version of this legend :— 

Dak was the son of Ved Viyds, the author of the Puranas, and 
was chosen in a Swdyamhar as her husband by Bhandli. Bhandli 
was the daughter of the Raja of Kashmir, who celebrated her 
Swayamhar with the condition that she should wed the man who 
answered her questions. Dak did po and married her. The Granth 
Bhaoidli in Punjabi gives all Bhandli's questions and Dak's answers 
in verses of which the following are examples : — 

Sat; andheri asliiami ode chand hadlon chhdyd 

Chdri pahhi tarmali ganjar basni dyd, 

PoochJio, parho Pandato vdcho Ved, Pordn 

Ek hi to pdni khoo men ek hi to part nashdn 

Nohdri to chdndni sunre kant same kd. hhdo 

Na harsi na goh hari na Poorab, Pachham vdo 

Bald hleva kharch kar dharn najhali ghds. 
A rough translation reads : 

* What would happen if the moon be covered by a cloud on the 
eighth dark night of the moon in the month of Asdrh ? All the four 
signs forebode the fall of rain. 

* The Brahman who nte from a dead man's hand was a Kashmiri. In by-gone days 
when a rdjd or wealthy mail died his direct passage to Heaven was secured by the follow- 
ing rite. His corpse was laid out on the pround and between it and the pyre, which was 
built not far o£E, was made a hearth on which khir (rice in milk) was cooked. This was 
placed in a skull, which was pot in the dead man's hand, and thence the Brahman was 
induced to eat the hhir by a fee of Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 30,000, or the grant of a village. He 
thus became a Khappari (fr. hhopri or khapri, a skull), and he and his children after 
him were cut-castes. Supernatural powers were attributed to them, and as they also 
pursued usury, they rapidly grew rich. After two or three generations, however, the 
Khappari's family could be re-admitted into caste on payment of a fine, and so on. A 
plate or lota is said to have been substituted for the skall. In Mandi State a Brahman, 
who must be good-looking, is fed and dressed for a year like the deceased Eaja. At the ex- 
piration of the year he is turned out of the State, and goes to Hardwar.He must never look 
back on the journey, and is never allowed to return to the iState, which p-riys him a pension. 

t In Mianwali the Dakauntri (sic) are said to be Suds by caste and descendants of Dak 
Bandlf, who composed a gmnfli on astrology called the Bandit Granth. In Rohtak the 
Daks are said to be descended from Sahdec risM, a dacoit (whence their name) who 
composed the Sahdeo Bhadli (Bhadli, his wife, was a sweeper woman). In this work natural 
phenomena are interpreted to forecast the future ; e.g., SuhL-ar vmli hddli rain sanishchar, 
chde luTxe Sahdeo: 'sun Bddli bin harse nahin jde.' i.e., " If clouds appear on Friday 
and stay till Saturday, they will not pass away without rain." In these verses Sahdeo 
usually addresses Bhadli. 

J In Gurgaon too Sahdeo la paid to have met a sweeper woman who told him that the 
auspicious moment had passed and bade him dive in a tank. He did so, and brought up 
first a gold bracelet and tben an iron one. Thinking her an expert he married her.

Another story is tbat when Ram Chandar invaded Ceylon, both he 
and his enemy Kawana were under Saturn's sinister influence, aod 
before he crossed tho strait which he had bridged Rdta Cbandar 
desired to give alms. But neither the Brahmans nor the Mahd- 
Brahmans nor tho Bias, would accept them, aud in answer to his 
prayer Brahma created a doll of grass, sprinkled sar jiwan* amrit 
over it by cuttinj? Pilrbati's little finger, and thus endowed it with 
life. Shivji and Durga bestowed on him veracity, the /anco and tho 
tilaJc, and Brahma bade him receive the alms offered to Rahu and 
Ketu, and to Saturn — whence he was also called Sanichari. 

The Dakaut, however, bears yet other names. As he knows a little 
astrology and can divine the evil influence of the planets, he is 
sometimes styled Jotgi ; in Rupar he is called Pdnda, and round 
Sirhind and Mdler Kotla Dhaonsif. One group is called ArpopoJ 
because it is skilled in palmistry §. 

From Si^lkot comes a still more curious legend : Var^h Mihr, a great 
astrologer from the Deccan, came in the course of his Avandering=> to a

hut on 7 successive Saturdays, in order to seciu-e male issue. Or he sots husband and wife 
by the cars by declaring that their burj or stars do not coincide, and that icmedial measures 
must be taken. Seated among the women he looks at the hand of one and tho forehead of 
another : consults his pntrd or tnble, counts on his finger.'^, and then utters common- 
place predictions. He knows hardly any astrology. On Saturday he goes round bogging 
with an idol of Sanishchar, and he accepts a buffalo calf born in Magh or a foal born in 
Sawan, or any black animal.

hostess asked him to form a temporary union with her daughter-in-law 
on the condition that her child should belong to him. ISo Dak was 
born. Years after Dak had to be surrendered to his father despite 
his attachment to his mother's kin^ but on the road home he saw that 
the corn in one field was mixed with stalks of a different kind like 
those iu one close by. His father, however, taught him that those 
stalks belonged not to the sower but to the owner of the field* ; and 
Pak applying the analogy to his own case compelled his father to 
restore him to his mother's kinsfolk. He founded the Dakauts. 

None of these variants quite agree with the account of the Dakauts 
given in the Karndl Gazetteer, 1890, which runs : — 

The Dakauts came from Agroha in the Dakhan. Raja Jasrat 
(Dasaratha), father of Ramcbandra, had excited the anger of Saturday 
by worshipping all the other grahas but him. Saturday accordingly 
rained fire on Jasrat's city of Ajudhia. Jasrat wished to propitiate him, 
but the Brahmans feared to take the offering for dread of the conse- 
quences; so Jasrat made from the dirt of his body one Daka Rishi who 
took the offerings, and was the ancestor of the Dakauts by a Sudra 
woman. The other Brahmans, however, disowned him ; so Jasrat 
consoled him by promising that all Brahmans should in future consult 
his children. The promise has been fulfilled. The Dakauts are pre- 
eminent as astrologers and soothsayers, and are consulted by every 
class on all subjects but the dates of weddings and the names of children, 
on which the Gaurs advise. They are the scapegoats of the Hindu 
religion ; and their fate is to receive all the unlucky offerings which no 
other Brahman will take, such as black things and dirty clothes. 
Especially they take the offerings of Wednesday, Saturday, and Ket. 
They are so unlucky that no Brahman will accept their offerings, and 
if they wish to make them, they have to give them to their own sister's 
sons. No Hindu of any caste will eat any sort of food at their hands, 
and at weddings they sit with the lower castes ; though of course they 
only eat food cooked by a Brahman. In old days they possessed the 
power of prophecy up to 10-30 a.m. ; but this has now failed them. 
They and the Gujrdtis are always at enmity, because, as they take 
many of the same offerings, their interests clash. 

In Kangra a confused variant of this legend makes Dak the astro- 
loger's sou by a Jtit girl, and Bhandli the daughter of a Rdjd,, whom 
Pak won in a swdyambara, answering all her questions by his art. 
Their son was Bojru. 

Another variant makes Garg give a miraculous fruit to the daughter 
of Gautama rishi. She eats it and vomits up a boy, who is in con- 
sequence called 40'k (vomiting). 

In the, Simla hills two legends regarding the origin of the Dakauts 
are current. According to the first the birth of Saturn,t decreased the 
Sun's lis;ht and power of illumination, so a Brahman propitiated the 
planet. Saturn was so pleased that he bade the Brahman ask a boon 
and agreed to become his pupil. He also proclaimed his intention of 
persecuting mankind unless placated by constant worship and devotion 



* The theory of paternity in Hindu Law is based upon a closely similar idea, 
t Hindu mythology avers that the Sun lost a sixteenth of his power on the birth of 
Saturn, bis eon. 



!rhe Bojrut.

His evil influence was to last for 7i years, but ho assured the Brahman 
that he should be kept in comfort provided ho and his descendants 
worshipped the god. The JDakauts are his descendants. 

The other story is that the Brahman fell under Saturn's evil influ- 
ence. He was instructing a king's daughter, and in tlio room was a 
wooden peacock which swallowed its pearl necklace. The Brahman 
was suspected of its theft and kept in custody for 2i days when, 
Saturn's influence ceasing, the necklace was disgorged by the bird and 
his innocence proved. When he reproached the god Saturn coolly told 
him that he was lucky in getting off with 2^ days instead of the full 
term of 7 4 years of ill-luck. 

In the Kangra hills tho Dakaut is usually called Bojrd*. Bojru 
means thought-reader and in olden times the Bojrus practised black 
magic, not astrology, Now-a-days they practise palmistry. 

In Kangra the Bojru or Dakaut groups are said to be 36 in number ; 
of these the following are found in that District :— ^ 



In Pdlampur tahsil^ 

1. Subdchh. 3. Bachh.

The Dakauts in Mianwd,]i are said to be Vasisht by gotra. 

In the Punjab the Bojrus are called Teli-rdjas, because they rub their 
bodies with oil, wear clothes soaked in oil and make a tikd of vermilion 
on their foreheads. They mostly beg from women, and carry about 
with them an image of Jawalamukhi who lives, they say, in Kdngra, 
and declares her acceptance of an offering by burning one half of it 
with her fiery tongue. Women are induced to give rings and clothes to 
the idol in return for dhup and sandhiir sanctified by tho goddess' touch. 
Small-pox is cured by applying the sandhtlr to the patient or burning 
the dhiqj before him. The Tcli-rdjas also tell fortunes by the samudrik. 

The Dakauts have 36 gats or sdscnis like the Gaurs including tho 
following ; —

* And the nanic (Jakaut is said to be derived from <lah, a small drum, which the Bojrus 
beat on Saturdays when begging ; but it is also said that Dak was the son of Garg rish{ hj 
4 KumhArni. They also beat a small drum over one's head to drive away evil. 



138 The Sdwanis. 

Of the 36 scisctns 30 are found in N^blia (where they are called 
Jotgis) and the other 6 form the sub-caste called the Purbia or Eastern 
Pakauts who are of inferior status * These two sub-castes eat and 
drink together, but do not intermarry. Betrothals are negotiated by 
Mirasis, not by N;us. In marriage 4 gots are avoided,t and karewa 
is allowed. None of the 5 pure Brahman groups certainly, or any 
other Brahman, it is said, will eat with the Dakaut or smoke with 
them : nor will Banid^s do so. 

These Dakauts take offerings {ddn) and alms {'pitn). They accept 
chhciyd da7is, as well as those made to Sanichar (Saturn), Ketu and 
Rahu. They also beg on Saturdays, receiving oil and coppers from 
Hindus. When begging they carry an iron image of Saturn. These 
dans are supposed to be karurl (hard, inauspicious) and to bring evil 
influences on the recipients, whence the proverb : 

Kdl Bdgar se upje, hurd Braliman se hoe. 

' Famine comes from the B^gar, and evil is done by the Brahman.* 

In Rohtak they live by palmistry and by begging, especially on a 
Saturday on which day they beg for oil,§ soap, coppers, a goat, 
he-buffah>, camel, horse, black grain, or other mean gifts. Some of 
them make a jD/ie7-i or 'tarn,' by going through a fixed number of 
lanes and repeating a fixed number of sentences at each door at a certain 
Ijour — usually early in the day. Besides gifts of oil made before bathing 
on a Saturday, Dakauts take gifts of iron, oil, salt, sweets, clothes, 
etc., weighed against persons who are under the influence of Saturn. 

The Pakauts observe all the Brahmanical ceremonies, and have 
Brahmans of their own. On the birth of a son they perform the 
ordinary Brahmanical rites, the ndm-karan, chaul karan, anna-'prdsna, 
chilra-haran, and upnayan karan. Their betrothal, wedding and 
general rites are also like those of other Brahmans. 

The Pakauts study astrology in the Bhadri Chhand and other Hindi 
chhandsj sometimes also from Sanskrit works. 

The Sawani or Sanwni Brahmans. 

Another term equivalent to Pakaut or Yedwa is Sawani, a Brahman 
who in Gurgaon interprets natural phenomena or the voices of birds 
and animals to forecast the future. The Sawanis appear to come from 

• Because it is said they eat flesh and drink liquor, which the Jotgis eschew. But the 
real reason would appear to be that they will accept certain offerings which a pure Brah- 
man would not take, such as those made to avert the influence of Rahu and Ketu. 
The Dakauta have also the Brahmanical gotms, Bhardwaj, Bashist, etc., (Nabha). 
t Only one sdsan is avoided according to the Nabha. account. 

X Dakauts, however, do not accept offerings made on the dead. These go to the Acharaj 
or Maha-Bralmian. 

§ In Ferozepore they beg for oil of rapeseed in small quantities almost as of right, 
singing : — 

Tel idmhe M mel, I " Oil and copper go together, he who 

Chhanichhar mandice, therewith worships Saturn will be for 

Sadd suhh pdive. ' ever happy.'' 

Well-to-do Hindus pour a little oil into a vessel, enough to reflect their face in, and give 
it to the Dakaut. This ensures them long life. 



Tha Ved'pdtrs, 139 

Lucknow, but the name is known as far west as Dora Ismd,il Khan and 
Babdwalpur.* 

The Ved-i'atr Crahmans. 

It is not easy to say definitoly what the Ved-p.itr ia. Tho word 
itself would certainly appear to mean " vessel of tho Vedas," and tlioso 
of tho Ved-patr who study the Vedas and expound them to disciples 
are styled Ved-pathis.t Others, it is said, merely perform the mjnndi 
and pind-clihrdan harm on tho 12th day after a death, but these rites 
are usually pei formed by an Acharaj. 

In Gui^gaon the Ved-pdtrs accept alms at eclipses and are also 
known as Gujnttis, and this is the case in Sidlkct too, but in Amritsar 
the Ved-ptitr ranks below tho Gujrdtia and traces his descent from Ved 
Datt, the son of tho Gujrati fciahdoo by a Sudra woman. The Ved- 
pdtr is also called Vedwa, and the Dakauts are an inferior branch of tho 
Vedwas, being descendants of Dak who married Patli a Mlechh woman. 
The Vedwd-s take chhdyi-jxHrX and other forbidden gifts, such as cocks 
and goats ; but tho Dakaut is on an even lower plane for he accepts 
buffaloes, malo or female, horses, etc., while standing in water. 

In Bannu the Gujrati is said to be also known as Ved-patr, which 
again is equivalent to Dak, or in Kashmir and the hills to Bojru ; in 
Peshdwar and Kohat to Paiufit or Madho ; in Dera Ismdil Khdn to 
Siiwani ; and in Lahore, etc., to Dakaut. Dak, a Brahman, is said to 
have married Bhadli, a courtezan, and from them are descended tho 
Daks, whose gotra is Kaplash, their gots being —

The Dakauts accept unlucky offerings, such as satana (7 kinds of 
grain mixed), oil, iron, goats, buffaloes and chhdyd-pdtr on Saturdays 
and eclipses. They also practise palmistry according to the Samndrah 
8hdstras, and swindle women, whom they frighten by means of charms 

• In Jlianwiili the Sawanfs are said to live by astrology and magic, divining evil 
influences by means of two iron pegs in a cup, in some obscure way, after the manner of the 
Jogis and Muhammadan Doriis. Jn Bahawalpur they are described as wandering out-castes, 
descended from a Brahman by a sweeper woman. Khatris, Aroras and other Brahmans will 
not associate with them and they accept black gifts at eclipses etc. 

t See Platts, p. 1208. Platts does not give Ved-patr, but both in Gurgaon and Rohtak pdtr 
is declared to mean " vessel." 

X The Vedwa takes alms on Saturdays, Sundays and Tuesdays, also when tho Bun passes 
into Rahu and Ketii, as well as to avert their influence at any other time. 

Offerings to Brahmans nro divided into bar or oraha, for the days of the week, and the 
two grahin for Rahii and Kefc, tho two demons who cause eclipses by attncking the sun 
and nionn. These two are parts of a demon ()-d/,s/(fj,s«), who, when sitting at dinner with 
the gods and demons drnnk of the nortnr of the god.i instead of the wine of tho demons. 
The snn and moon told of him, and Bhugwan cut him into two parts, of which Hahu, in- 
cluding the stomnch and therefore the nectar, is tho more worthy. When any body wishes 
to offer to Brahmnns from illness or other cniise, ho con!*ulta n Brahman who casta 
his horoscope and directs v^-hich offering of tho ^even r7)Y(/uis should bo made. The grahins 
are more commoidy offered during an eclipse, that to Rahii being given at tho bc^inninfj 
and that to Kot at the end of the transit. The Ganr BrahmatiH -will not take any black 
olTeritigs, such as a buffalo or goat, iron, FCsamo {til) or tinl, black blankets or cloihes, 
eatt, etc., nor oil, second hand clothes, green clothes; nor aatndja, which ia seven grains 
mixed, with a piece of iron in them; these Lelonping to the grahe whose rif[< rings are 
forbidden to them. An exceptioD, however, is made in favour of a black cow. 



140 The Dasaurias and Bids, 

written on paper in invisible ink. These practices are, however, said to 
be confined to Pakauts from Kdngra. 

The Dasaueia Beahmans. 

The Saurlas or Dasaurias* practise exorcism in the following way :— 
Four or more are called in and they apply fumes to the patient's 
nostrils, while lie sits on his feet, reciting meanwhile cha>rm8 like this: 
Le hulare mere hhalna, ae apii lalier sambhdl, " Jump up, my sturdy 
one, come in your ecstasy/' What with the heat and the strong scent 
the patient perspires freely, and this operation is repeated twice a day 
until his senses return. The exercisers get Rs. 5 or 10 as their fee. 
The patient is fed on almonds and churi.f The solemnity of the rite is 
sometimes enhanced by performing it on a burning ground.| 

A few Saurias are found in Rohtak where they work wonders with 
charms. They can thrust a sword through a man without hurting 
him, and bring sickness on an enemy. In Gurgaon§ by collecting a 
dead man's bones they magically obtain full control over his ghost, and 
to defeat them one of the bones should always be hidden. In Siiilkot 
they are exercisers, but also haunt burning-grounds. 

The Gdjeati oe Bias Beahmans. 

The Gujrd,ti is a territorial group, which immigrated from Guzerat. 
Gujrdti Brahmans also bear the following professional titles : — 

1. Bias, meaning updeshak or preacher. G. Tarwari, or one who has performed a 

a! Joshi, for Jotashi, astrologer. karma land of ten sanshdrs, directed 

3'. Pandaji.^Pawflifa. others to perform them and himself 

4.' Mahta or chief.' acted as a priest at those rites. 

5! Rawal or itinerant sdd/nJ. 11 7. Janji, or family priest, who used to act 

as a go-between at betrothals, as the 
Nais now do. 

The Gujr^ti Brahmans also have 4 main groups which rank in the 

following order : — 

f T f 1- Vadanagar.^ 3. Andich or Pahari. 

Sub-caste 1. ^ g^ jjagar or Visalnagars.** 4, Bararia or Srim^li. 

Of these groups the Yadandgar are the i^^i (family priests) of the 
N^gars, whose daughters they take in marriage and with whom they 
eat both Jcachchi find iiakhi. The Nagars, however, cannot take 
Vadanao-ar girls in marriage. Both these first two groups avoid ajiy 
intercourse with the two last. The B^rarias are the Bias of the 
nichi-sharan or lower grade ; because B^rar married a girl of his own 
family. 

The relations of the Gujrati to other Brahmans are curiously 
contradictory at first sight, but perfectly logical in reality. Owing to 
their strictness in religious observances, and their purity in food and

the ashirbdd or benediction on tlio Gaur and the tSarsut. In spite 
of this they are all looked down upon for taking the chhaydf (shadow), 
grahant (eclipse) and tula ddn^ (offerings) : that is to say, they are 
despised for taking upon themselves the sins of tho community. 

In marriage two gotras are usually avoided, but sometimes only one 
is excluded. Exchange marriages are very common. At a wedding 
the bridegroom wears a silird or chaplet only, and not a crown [niaur). 
The pair are dressed like Shiva and Pjirbati in silk.]] 

At weddings the Ndgars worship Shiva the destroyer, and at 
funerals Vishnu the nourisher, a curiously perverse reversal of the 
ordinary rule. Shiva is their isht-dewa. They observe the ten harms 
of Shiva, and are guided by the Parvami-mdnsd or Jaimni-sutra. 

The Gu jrdti gotras are : — 

Gargas. I Itri. I Parisar. 

Gaiitam. | Kashiva. i Sangras. 

The Gujr^ti are said to have no gots. 

The flosAiNi Brahmans. 

The Husaini Brahmans are Hindus, wear the janeo and mark the 
tilak on their foreheads, but they beg from Muhammadans and not 
from Hindus, and narrate the story of Hazrat Imam Hnsait*, whence 
they are called Eusaini. They say they were originally Blidt Brahmans, 
and have some of their gots: — Gappe, Bhakar, Lande, Gi'ire, Dargopal, 
Kati, Chat Chut, Rabat, Bh^iradwaji, Dangmar, and many more. They 
marry in their own caste, avoiding 4 gots in marriage. They cannot 

* They do not eat kachchi or pahki cooked by Gaur or Sarsut Brahmans : nor any Hindu 
caste ; but they may take sweet stuff cooked in milk by people of such pure Hindu castes 
as the Gaur and Sarsut Brahmans, and the Banias. The Gujrati or Biaa Brahmana, who 
came from Guzerat are in some respects the highest class of all Brahmans; they are 
always fed first; and they bless a Gaur when they meet him, while they will not eat 
ordinary bread from his hands. They are fed on the 12th day after death, and the Gaurs 
will not eat on the 13th day, if this has not been done. But they take inauspicious 
offerings. To them appertain especially the Rahu offerings made at an eclipse. They will 
not take oil sesame, goats, or green or dirty clothps ; but will take old clothes if washed, 
buffaloes, and sahmja. They also take a special offering to Hahu made by a sick person, 
who puts gold in ghi, looks at his face in it, and gives it to a Gnirati, or who weighs himself 
against satnoja and makes an offering of the grain. A bnff.do which has been possessed 
by a devil to that degree that he has got on to the top of a house (often r.o difficult feat 
in a village), or a foal dropped in the month of Sawan or buffalo calf in Magh are giv^n 
to the Gujratifls being unlucky. No Gaur would take them. Every harvest the Gnjrati 
takes a small allowanco (seorhi) of grain from the threshing floor, just as does the Gaur, 

tThe chhdyd-ddn is SO called because in sickness the giver looks at his reflection in some 
ghi poured into a bronze cup (,1-atort). If he is unable to see his face in the ghi he will die. 
The din itself comprises the cup, with the fanj-ratan. 

Other dans are ; the Rah^i and Ketii ddn», which consist of black cloth, flowers, etc., like 
the Sanichar ddn they are offered to Rahu, Ketii and Sanichar in sickness, or at weddings. 
The mdhd-ddn or " great gift," consisting of land or elephants, and made at death. The rog- 
Ihnrvi-hidhi ddn of black cloth is made to avert disease (»-oy). 

X The grahn-ddn comprises gold, silver placed in a cocoanut, and ornaments. It must be 
given by the offerer standing in the water of the tank at Thanesar. Grain, clothes or 
cows may be given at home. 

§ The hdd-ddn is an offering equal to one's weight in grain or coin. It is made by 
wealthy people on their birthday. 

II Other Hindus are, it is said, dressed like Krishna and Radha. The xihra is a bridal 
chaplet, the main- or inula f is a paper crown, worn by tho bridegroom. Krishna a.^ a 
wearer of the latter is called Muktdharf. Shiva or Mahadeva had no maur, even at his 
wedding, whereas Krishna always wears the mulint. This is interesting, but it leaves th^ 
use of tho crown at weddings unexplained. 



142 The Religion of the Brahnans, 

marry witli Bhdt Brahmans, but take water from their hands and vice 
versa. They are ignorant of their own religion and do not worship in 
viandarfi, but their janeos are made by Brahmans ; and auspicious times 
for weddings, etc., arc fixed by them. They have the same customs aa 
other Hindus, and believe in their pantheon. Their own tradition is 
that Yazid's troops en their return, after cutting off Imd,m Husain's 
head, stopped in Rd-hab, their ancestor's l)ome at Bdthowdl in the 
Sialkot District, and placed the head in his house. In the morning, 
finding the head to be that of the Prophet, he kept it, and gave the 
soldiers his own son's head instead, but they discovered that it was 
not the same as the one they h^d brout?ht. So Bahab cut off all his 
seven sons' lieads in succession and gave them to the soldiers. Since 
then Husaiiiis beg from Muhammadans. 

The religion of the Beahmans. ' 

The Brahman, even the Hiisaini, is almost always a Hindu, but a 
few have become Sikhs. Conversion, however, does not appear to 
have created any new divisions in the caste, though it has liad a 
disruptive influence in the following case : — The Patak section of 
the S.irsut Brahmans has two sub -divisions, Machhi-khdn^i and 
Khir-khilt .4. The former are farohits of the third Guru of the Sikhs 
(Guru Araar Das), who was a Baishnav (abstainer from meat and 
drink). The second Guru (Angadl used to eat meat and fish. In 
order to follow the second Guru's habit and yet maintain his Baishnav- 
ship, the third Guru gave a fish at the hhnddan (head-shaving^ 
ceremony of his son to his ^)ar^//l^7, and so liis descendants are called 
Machhi-kh;ui:ls (fish-eaters) to this day. And the descendants of the 
third Guru at a son's hhaddan at their temple at Gondwdl in Amritsar 
give a fish, made of gram -flour and boiled in oil, to their jparohit (a 
de.scendant of the original Machhi-khan^) instead of a live one. The 
ceremony, however, no longer called hhaddan — since shaving the head 
is prohibited among the Sikhs — and in its stead, the custom is to make 
the boy wear his hair long like a Sikh's, whereas before that the boys' 
. hair was cut and plaited like a girl's. 

Beahm-chaei,* a religmus student ; a Brahman from the time of his investi-

Bughti — Bunirg. 143 

BuGHTf, BuGTr, also called Zarkanni, an organized Balocr tnman wliicli occu- 
pies the angle between the frontiers of the Punjab and Upper Sindh. 
Its clans are the Raheja, No//;iini,* Masoi-i, Kalphur, Phong or Mondrilni 
and kShambiini or Kiazai. The last, which is an almost independent 
section, separates the main tribe from our border; while the Marri lie 
still further west. The Bugti are made up of various elements, chiefly 
Rind, but claim descent from Gyiindar, son of Mir Chakur, whose 
son Ralieja gave his name to one of its septs, though the name has an 
Indian sound. The Noi/uini clan has supernatural powers (see p. 46, 
sujpra) and the Shambani form a ^\\h-tuman, which is sometimes con- 
sidered distinct from tbe Bneti. This tuman has its head-quarters at 
SyAhttf, formerly Marrao or Dera Bibrak (fr. hlvaragli, a cliief), also 
called Bugti Uera. 

BuHAR, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar : also in the Bahdwalpur, 
Bikdner and Jaisalmer States, and in Sindh, as well as scattered over 
Multan and Muzatfargarh. They are labourers, tenants and camel- 
breeders in the South-West Punjab and intermarry with the Dahas, 
Palyjirs and Parhars, all branches of the Punwar stock. 

Bdk, a Mahtam clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

BuKHAEi, a Sayyid clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar : see Sayyid.

BuLEcZ/ti (Buledi, Bule^/uVBurdi), an organized Baloch tuman in Dera Glu'izi 
Khdn, also found near the Indus in Upper Sindh, in the tract called 
Burdika, and iu the Kachhi territory of Kalat. 

Buna, Buniya: see Chamar. 

BuEA, a small J^t clan, found in Jind. The samddh of its jathera is at 
Kallu Kotli in Patiala, and it is worshipped at weddings. 

BuijiANA, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Sh^hpnr. 

BuJKARAs. — The Buraras, originally named Hojali, are claimed by some 
as a Samma sept, but otluTS say they are a separate tribe. Their 
tradition is that they are de-'cended from a litija of Girnar near 
Jundgadh, who migrated to Sindh and was converted to Islam. The 
saint who converted him gave him a btii- (Ar. for " cloak,^') whence 
their name. They have three .«^epts : — 

[i) Bhojri or Bhojri-pat)as, four.d in Bnliawalpnr and Bikaner, and 
the highest in status, (ti) Sathia, and (in) Jokhia. 

BuBisn : see Yashkun. 

BuEEA, a Jat tribe, found in Dera Ghazi Khdn and Balidwalpur. The title 
of J^im is prefixed to their names and it is probably of Sindhi origin. 

BuTA, a Jat tribe, apparently confined to Hoshiarpur. Possibly the same as 
the Bhutta of the Western Plains or the Buttar of the Sikh tract. 

Bdtaba, fr. hut, a stcne. A caste of stone-cutters, found in the Kilngra hills, 
who used to be emp'oyed on the forts and temples of that tract. Barnes 
described them as idle and dissijiatcd. 

BufTAK, a small Jat tribe found chiefly on the Upper Sutlej said to be 
descended from a Silrajbansi Kajpnt who C:ime from the Lakki jungle 
and settled first in Gujranwala. Also found as a Hindu Jilt clan (agri- 
cultural) in Montgomery.

Chabeldas(I), -panthi ; a potty sect, founded by an Arora disciple of Shdmii,

Shamji's followers. 8ee Shamdclsi. 

Chachar, an agricultural clan, found in Shahpur and Multdn, classed as Ja( 
in the latter District. In Bahawalpur the Chdchars claim Mughal 
origin and they produce tables tracing their descent from Timur whom 
they connect with Abbds, cousin of Husain, son of Ali. But tradition 
says that the Surar, Subhago, Silro and Chitchat' tribes were once slave3 
of Riija Bungit, Rdi, raja of Amrkot, and that Jam Jhakhar redeemed 
them, and there is a saying : 

Surar, Snhlidgo, iS'dro, cliauthi Cliacharld, 
Anda lid Jam JJiaJchare hd hdhndn Bunga Ra. 

" Surar, S'jbhago (or Subh^a), Silro (or Silrii), (these three) and a 
fourth tribe, the Chachar Avere the slaves of Bung<i Rai ; it was J^m 
Jhakhar who brought thorn," (effecting their emancipation from Bimg^ 
Rai). 

The Clid,chars have several septs : — Raj-dc, the highest in status ; 
Rahmjtni, whose ancestors were Tchal/fas of Ghaus Bah^-ud-Din Zakariya : 
hence they are also called Shaikh- R ah mani, and some sanctity still 
attaches to the sept ; Narang, Jugana, Jhunjha, Chhutta, Gureja, 
Rukana, Kalra, Mudda, Diiwdni, Dohija, Gabr:tni, Muria, Kharyani 
and Zakrid,ni or followers of Ghaus Bahd,-ud-Din Zakariya. 

The whole tribe, however, are followers of that saint and never 
become disciples of any but his descendants. Chachar is also an Ardin

H6 Chdhil^Chdhi. 

Chahal, or more correctly Chuhil.— One of the largest Jdt tribes in tlie 
Punjab. They arc found in greatest numbers in Patittla, but are very 
numerous in Ambala and LudhiYma, ximritsar, and Gurdiispur, and extend 
all along under the hills as far west as Gujr^mwala and Si^dkot. It is 
SHid that Pi^ja Agarsen Surajbansi had four sons, Ch^diil, Chhina, Chima, 
and Sahi, and that the four Jdt tj-ibes who bear these names are 
sprung from them : (yet they intermarry). Their original home was 
Malwa, whence they migrated to the Punjclb. According to another story 
their ancestor was a Tunwar R^ijput called R^jd lUkh, who came from 
the Deccan and settled at Kahlur. His son Birsi married a Jdt woman, 
settled at Matti in the Malwa about the time of Akbar, and founded 
the tribe. 

In Amritsar the Chahil say that Cbdhal was a son of EAj6, Khang, 
who once saw some fairies bathing in a tank. He seized their clothes 
and only restored them on condition that one of theni became his 
bride. One Jchhr^n was given him, on condition that he never abused 
her, and she bore him a son, but one day he spoke harshly to her and she 
disappeared.* But to this day no Chahil ever abuses his daughter ! Settled 
first at Kot Gadana near Delhi, the Chahil migrated to Pakhi ChahiMn 
near Ambdla and there founded Eala Joga or Jogarla in the Md,lwa. 

The Chi'ihil affect Jogi Pir, originally Joga, son of Eajpfll, who is said 
to have been killed, after fighting with the Mughals even when he had 
been decapitated. Jogi Pir is their clihara {?jathera), and a fair is held 
in his honour on the 4th nauratrn in Asauj. ]n Jind the Chdhil 
claim descent from Bala, a Chauhan Rtliput who took a J^t wife, and 
so lost caste, but he acquired influence i3y accepting offerings made to 
Guga, and Chahils, vdiatsoever their caste, still take these offerings.! 
In Jind the Chahil worship Khera Bhumia. 

They are probably, says Mr. Pagan, B^gris, originally settled in 
Bikdner. 

Chahal, a Hindu and Muhammadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in 
Montgomery. 

Chaong, Cqang, a minor agricultural caste, found in the western portion of 
the lower ranges of Kangra and Hoshiarpur. In the Dasuya tahsil of 
the latter district they own some \"illagGS, but are generally tenants. 
The term appears to be a purely local synonym of Bdhti or Ghirth. 
The Chang is quiet and inoffensive, diligent and a good cultivator, like 
the Saini of the plains. 

Chaik, a sept of Brahmans, hereditary priests of Keonthal. 
Chaina, a small tribe, cla'^sed as Jilt, in Dera Ghazi Khd,n. 

Cbak, (1) a Kamboh clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar, (2) a sept of Jdts 
to which Rdniha is sometimes said to have belonged. J 

Chaki, Chakani, the Multani equivalent for Teli or oilman.

* Through an opening in the roof— and so the Chahil do not make openings in their roofs 
to this day. They also avoid Avearing red clothes ; and, till recently, at any rate, did not 
use baked bricks in their honses— a relic of the time when they were ncmads, probably. 

t In Jind tahsil it is indeed said that the pvjdris of Giiga are generally called chahil : in 
Sangrur they are known as hhagats:. In Patiala Chahil is said to have been born of a hill 
fairy : and Baland Jogi Pir ia worshipped as their /af/iem.

Chakabke, a Kliarral clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Chakora, a Jut clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Chakealawi, fr. Chakrd,la a village in Mianw^ili : a new sect, which 
rejects more than half the Qimin, founded by one Ghuhim Nabi of 
Chakrtila, whose followers call themselves Ahl-i-Quran, i.e., believers 
in the Qur^in only. It rejects all the other traditions of the Propliet. 
Its founder has now changed his name to Abdulhth as he objected 
to being called ghuldm (servant) of the Prophet. He believes that the 
Quran is the only book wliich lays dovv'n what is required of a true 
Muslim and that the other subsidiary books and sayings of Muhammad 
are of no account. Ho has accordingly devised a new form of prayer 
which is distinct from that prescribed by the Prophet. 

His followers are numerous in the Shdhbaz Khel and Yarn Khel 
villages of the Mianwali tahsil, as well as in Dera Ismail Kht'm and 
Lahore. A monthly journal called the Ishaat-ul-Qurdn used to be 
published by Shaikh Chitfcu, a leading adherent of the sect in Lahore. 
As the sect did not thrive at Lahore its founder has now settled in 
Dera Ismail Khan. 

Chamal, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Chamain, a tribe of Gujars, claiming descent from a Tunwar Rtijput by a 
Gujar mother. They came from Delhi and are very old inh^bifants of 
the Karnul District, having possibly been expelled from Delhi by Sher 
Shdh. Chamain is probably only a local appellation. 

Chamab, Chamidr, fern. Chamd,ri, -iarf. 

The Chamd,r is the tanner and leather-worker of North-Western In- 
dia,* and in the western parts of the Punjttb he is called Mochi whenever 
he is, as he grenerally is, a Musalman, the caste being one and tiie same. 
The name Chamar is derived from the Sanskrit charmal-'h-a or "worker 
in hides.^' But in the east of the Punjab he is far more than a leather- 
worker. He is the general coolie and field labourer of the villages; and 
a Chamar, if asked his caste by an Englishman at any rnte, will 
answer " Coolie " as often as " ChaTodr."t They do all the hegor, ov 
such work as cutting grass, carrying wood and bundles, acting as watch- 
men, and the like ; and they plaster tlie houses with mud when they 
need it. They take the hides of all dead cattle and the flesh of all cloA'en- 
footed animals, that of such as do not divide the hoof going to Chuhrds. 
They make and mend shoes, thongs for the cart, and whips and otlier 
leather work; and above all they do an ifmnense deal of hard work in 
the fields, each family supplying each cultivating association with tho 
continuous labour of a certain number of hands. All this they do as 
village menials, receiving fixed customary dues in tho shape of a share 
of the produce of the fields. In the east and south-east of the Punjab 
the village Charaars also do a great deal of weaving, which however is 
paid for separately. The Chamars stand far above the Chiihras in social

position, and some of tlieir tiibes are almost accepted as Hindus.* They 
are generally dark in colour, and arc almost certainly o£ aboriginal 
origin, though hero again their numbers have perhaps been swollen by 
members of other and higher castes who have fallen or been degraded. 
Tlie people say : 

Karid Brahman, got Chamdr 
In ke sdth na utrie par. 
" Do not cross the ferry with a black Brahman or a fair Cham^r/^ 
one beino- as unusual as the other. Their women are celebrated for 
beauty, and loss of caste is often attributed to too great partiality for 
a Chamari. 

The traditional origin of the Chamars is that Chanu (or Cbanwe) and 
Banu were two brothers : the former removed a cow's carcase with hia 
own hands and so Banuf out-casted him.t In Kapurthala, however, 
another version is current, and according to this Gat told his brother 
Met to remove a carcase and then declined to associate with him for 
doing so, and the Mirasi who witnessed the incident, took Gat's part. 
Frotu Mat are descended the Chamars. 

Synonyms. — It is difficult to say what are the real synonyms of Chamdr. 
The term Chuhra-Chama,r is often used to denote the group formed by 
the two castes, just as Mochi-Julahd, is used, but it does not imply that 
the two castes are identical. Just as the Muhammadan Chamar is 
styled MocHi so the Sikh Chamar is called Ramdasia {qq. v.). In Sirsa 
a Chamar is called Meghwdl as a compliment, but opprobionsly he is 
styled Dhecl§ or Dherh, a term applied to any 'low fellow \ The 
* Meghwd.1' claim descent from Megh-rikh who was created by Narain. 

Groups. — The Chamars are divided into several sub-caste?. In the 
Eastern Punjab there appear to be at least five true sub-castes which 
do not intermarry. These are in order of precedence : — ■ 

i. Chdndor, said in Delhi to trace its origin from Benares, possibly 
from some association with Kabir. It is the principal sub- 
caste in Hissdr, including Sirsa, and its members do not tan, 
leaving that to the Chamrangs and Khatiks, and working only 
in prepared leather. See also under Meghwdl. 

ii. Raiddsi or Rabdasi, named after Rai Dd,s Bhagat, himself a 
Chamdr, a contemporary of Kabir, and like him a disciple of 
Ramdnand. It is the prevalent sub-caste in Karnal and its 
neighbourhood. 

iii. Jatia, found in greatest numbers about the neighbourhood of 
Delhi and Gurgaon. They work in horse and camel hides, 
which are an abomination to the Chandar, probably as having 
the foot uncloven; and are perhaps named from the word jat 

* The Chamars will eat food prepared by any tribe excppt the Khakrob (Clbiihra), Kanjar, 
Sansi and Nat, Smokino; is only aU'wed anions tbemseWes and they will not eat or 
drink from a Dhobi, a Bum or a Ni'ljiar (indigo dyer). [KMrnalJ. 

t Banu or Banwe here would appear to be the eponym of the Bania caste, which is snid 
to still worship an dr and a ramhi at weddings. 

J A Diim witn-^ssed the occurrence, and so to this day m> Cbamar will eat or drink 
from a Dum or Miraf'i's hands, 

§ The Dhel appears to be a separate caste in the rentral Provinces, though closely allied 
mth the CharaAr. The Dhed is also a large tribe in Kachh and Sindh, also called Bhambi.

a camel-grazier. On tlio other hand, they aro said to obtain 
the services of Gaur Brahmans, which woukl put them abovo 
all other Charaars, who have to bo content with the minisatrtions 
of the outcast Chamarwa Brahman. 

iv. Chambar, the prevalent sub-caste further west about Jullundur 
and Ludhiana. 

V. Golia^ lowest of all the sub-castes, indeed Golia is the name of 
a section of many menial castes in the Eastern Punjdb, and 
in almost all cases carries with it an inferior standino- in the 
caste. 

Further west, in Ndbha, the sub-castes are, however, said to be four 
in number, viz. ;— 

1. Buna (Buuia). 

2. Chamdr. 

3. Chamarwa, ) i. i. i i .i • 

4. Chanbar(64) } who touch unclean thmgg. 

The Buna appears in Ludhiana as the Bunia, a Sikh Chamar, who 
having taken to weaving ranks higher than tlie workers in leather. 1'he 
Bahtia* is also said to be a Sikh Chamar who has taken to weaving, 
but many Rahtias are Muhammadans. 

Territorially the Chamnrs in Patiala are divided into two groups wh ich 
do not intermarry and thus form sub-castes. These are the Bagvi, or 
immigrants from the Bagar, found in the south-east of the State, 
and the Desi. 

Among the Desi iu Patiala two occupational gi'oups are found, nz., 
the Chamdrs who make shoes, and the Bonas, the latter sub-caste 
being weavers of blankets by occupation and Sikhs by religion. 

The Jind account divides the Chamdrs into 5 sub-castes, viz., Rdm- 
ddsi, Jatia, Chdmar [sic), Pdthi and Raigar, but it is not clear whether 
these are occupational or territorial or sectarian groups. The Nabha 
account says they are divided into 4 groups, viz., Chanwar, Jatid., 
Bahmnia (?) and Ciamar [sic). The Chdnwar are again divided into 
two sub-castes (?), Chanwar proper, who are Sultdni.s by reho-ion and 
workers in leather; and the Bonas (or blanket-weavers) who are Sikhs 
of Guru Govind Singh. The Bonas are not found in the south-east. 
The Jatias (descendants of Jntti, wife of Ramdds) are found only in 
the south-east and are regarded as inferiors by the Chanwars, who do 
not drir)k or smoke with them. A curious story is told of the orio-in 
of the Jatids, connecting the name with jhant (pubes). No Chanwar 
Chamar would give the Julias' forefather a girl to wife, so he married 
a Chuhra's daughter, but the jJicratf were nor, completed when a dispute

* In Sirsa the word seems to be applieri to the members of any low caste, such as Chamar 
or Chuhra. Mr. Wilson, however, had never heard the word used. Iu Patiala it is said to 
be applied t) a Sikh Chamar. 



150 Chamdr afots.

The Calimnia al^^o claim descent from a wife of RiCmdas, and wear the 
janeo and thus assert their superiority over other Chamd,rs, but they 
are not found in Niibha. 

The BiUi is apparently the village messenger of the Delhi division. 
He is at least as often a Chuhra as a Chamdr, and ought perhaps to be 
classed with the former. But there is a Chanid,r clan of that name who 
work chiefly as grooms. 

The Dusddh is a Purbi tribe of Chamdrs, and has apparently come 
into the Punjab with the troops, being returned only in Delhi, Lahore, 
and Anibdla, 

Of the above groups it is clear that some are true sub-castes based 
on occupation, while others like the Buna are merely occupational 
groups which may or may not intermarry with other groups. This differ- 
entiation of the groups by occupation is most fully developed in the 
eastern and sub-montane tracts, where the Chamars form an exceedingly 
large proportion of the population and are the field-labourers of the 
villages. But in the central districts their place in this respect is 
taken by the Chuhra. In the west, too, the leather-worker, like all 
other occupational castes, is much less numerous than in the east. 
The weaver class, on the other hand, is naturally least numerous in 
the eastern Districts, where much of the weaving is done by the leather- 
working castes. And, when the Chamar sticks to leather-working in 
the eastern Districts, he is apparently dubbed Chamrang or Dabgar, 
just as in the Punjdb proper a Chamdr who has adopted Islam, and 
given up working in cow-hide becomes a Mussalman Khatik tanner. 

The gots or sections of the Chamars are very numerous, and some 
of them are large. They include the Chauhdn and Bhatti gots^ 
(numerous in the (;entral and eastern Districts, especially Ambdla) and 

Mahmi. 

Phundwal. 

Sindhu. 

Of these eleven gots all but the Kathana are found in the Jullundur 
division. 

The Chamars are by religion Hindus or S]khs. 

Owing to the fact that the famous bhagat Rdmdas was a Chamar 
by caste, many Chamars are Ramdasiast by sect, and of this sect again 
some are also Sikhs. 

Rdmdas was a descendant of Chanu. His mother, Kalsia, was child- 
less, but one day a/a^fr came to her and she gave him flour, in return 
for which he promised her a son. On his return his guru cross-ques- 
tioned him, as he was unable to pronounce the name ' I'armeshwar,' and 
learning of his promise declared that, as no aon had been bestowed on 
Kalsia in her destiny, the faqir himself must be born to her. So he 

* The two most numerous gots among the Mochis also, I'hey may of course have adopted 
these got names from the Rajputs, as Bains and Sindhu may have been b r rowed from 
the Jats. 

f The Ramdasia also claim descent from Ramdas. The Ramdasia (Sikhs) take the 
pahul from Chamars and drink ainrit at their hands. Ihe Mazhabi take them from the 
sweepers' hands. (Kapurthala).

was reborn as R^rndda, who is called Raidas in Biiwal. As his mother 
was a Chamd,ri he refused her breasts, until his gurii bade him suck. 
One day when placed by his mother at a spot where Iliima Nand used 
to pass, he was touched by that taachcr's sandals, and when he cried 
out was told by him to be silent and repeat ' Ram Kdm.' Thus wa3 
supernatural power bestowed upon him. 

Contrary to the Ciiamars' customs Ramdas wore a janeo, sounded a 
conch, and worshipped idols. The Erahmans appealed to the magis- 
trate, whereupon Rarndds cast the idols into a tank, but they returned 
to him, whereas the Brahmans failed in a similar test. Again, cutting 
his neck open Ramdas exhibited 4 jdneos, of gold, silver, copper and 
thread, typical of the 4 yugas. Thenceforth he was known as a 
famous hhagat.* 

Cham^r women wear no nose-ring, but among the Bunas it is wora 
by married women, not by widows. The Chdrimars of Bdwal do not 
wear gold nose-rings, and all the Chamiirs of that locality avoid 
clothes dyed in safEron, and the use of gold. They also use beestings 
only after offering it to the gods on the amdicas.

Chamrang, (a synonym of Chanuir, chiefly returned from Patidla and 
Si^lkot), the term chamrang is probably a purely occupational term. 
The chamrang does not stain or dye leather, but only tans it: fr. 
rangnd (which as apphed to leather means to Man '). The chamrang 
moreover only tans ox and buffalo hides, and does not work in the 
leather which he tans. By caste he is probably always a Chamar. 
■ In Delhi the term appears to be practically a synonym for Khatik 
( q. V. ), but the Khatik is, strictly speaking, a carrier, not a tanner, and 
a Mnhammadan, while the chamrang is a Hindu. In Gujrat also 
the chamrang is identical with the Khatilc.

are originally a vagrant tribe who wander about in search of work • 
but in the neighbourhood of large cities they are settled in colonies. 
They will do almost any sort of work, but are largely employed in 
agriculture, particularly as reapers ; while their women are very generally 
employed in sifting and cleaning grain for p rain -dealers. They are all

at all given to crime. They have a dialect of their own regarding which, 
and indeed regarding the tribe generally, the late Dr. Jjeitner published 
some interesting information. He says that they call themselves not 
Changgar but Chubna, and plausibly suggests that Changgar is derived 
from clilidnna to sift. It has been suggested that Changgar is another

Bhojar, and Bharpdl, said by some of the tribe to be descended from Pir 
Channar, but the more general belief is that the Pir never married and that 
the Channars are descended from his seven brothei-s, sons of Rai Sandhila. 
The Channars are, however, believed to be an offshoot of the Mahrs. 

Channar Pir: — Four miles from Derawar, on a hillock, is the tomb of

any Muhammadan in the city, male or female. He was told that there 
was none and he then asked if any woman was pregnant. The Rai said 
his wife was, and the Sayyid then ordered him to em})lc»y a Muhammadan

expossd him on tlie hillock, but a cradle of santal wood descended from 
heaven for the child. Seeing this Rai Sandhila endeavoured to take 
the child out of the cradle, but failed, as, whenever he approached, the 
cradle rose in the air. When the child grew up, he accepted Makhdum 
Jahanidn as his Pir, and as he was brought up in poverty so his tomb 
is especially efficacious for the rearing of children. The Channar tribe 
is descended from the seven brothers of the Pir. Both Hindus and

being eaten by both as brethren. Hindus are not polluted by contact

the Chaudliritils are the representatives of tlie old taluqddrs, Avhcreas 
tlie Zanilndiirs represent the new men put in during bikh rule. The 
former is the more numerous and powerful, but the latter is more 
united. Marriages between metrberd of these factions are much more 
rare than marriages between members of diifereut tribes. These fac- 
tions have ramifications which extend into Find Dadan Khun tahsil, 
across the Shahpur Salt Range and down into the Sli;ihpur i)lains. For

Hindustfin. Before the seat of their power was moved to Delhi, Ajmer* 
and Sambhar in Jaipur seem to have been their home. After their 
ejectment from Delhi they ai'e said to have crossed the Jumna to 
Sdmbhal in Muradabad, and there still dwell the genealogists and bards 
of the Chauhan of the Nardakt of Karnal and Ambahi in which Districts

the Chauhan spread northwards. In Karnil their cliaudhridis are Gumthala, RaoSambhli, 
Habri and, chief of all, Jundla. 

t For the Chauhan migrations and their conquest of the Pundirs see the article on 
B4iputB, 

J Rana Harra alsohad four illegitimate sonfl, by a Rorni, a Glijari, a Jatniand a Hnjamni 
respectively. The latter's son. Kawal Kaj, founded a hdra^ or group of 12 villages, of 
Rajputs : the Jatni's son, Bhadhi, was the ancost'ir of the Mndhnl Jats who hold two 
tarns, one in Kalsora in Thanesar, the other in Saharanpur. But the Karnal tradition i3 
different. It assigns to Rana Elarrni two Rajput wives and five of inferior status, viz., n 
Rorni, Avhose descendants form the Dopla got of the Roi's, a Jatni, a Gujari, a Joerin and a 
Nain. The descendants of the two latter are the Rajputs <>{ Muatafabad pargava in Jagadhri 
tahsil, while the Jatni's and Gujari's progeny appear to have settled east of the Jumna. 

§ Hantha or Ranta was the son of Kana Har Rai's old ago and his step-brothers 
disputed his legitimacy. So be appealed to the king of Delhi and his mother said that she 
had fed the Rana on dolah, a fiah supposed to possess aphrodisiac qualities. Tlie king 
declared that Ranti's sweat would smell of the fish if he were legitimate, lie ful611ed the 
test and was declared legitimate.

Ranilia's clcscenclants drove tlie Koli Rajputs across tlie Tangri, wliere 
they may still be found. 'I'llok Cliand, son of Subli Mai, liis descendant,

Mai's second son, M^nak Chand, turned Muhammadan and took the 
pachdsi or 85 remaining. Jagajit, 8th in descent from Tilok Chand, 
was Guru Govind Singh's antagonist c. 1700 A. D. In 1756 his 
grandson, Fateh Chand, with his two sons Bhup Singh and Chuhar 
Singh, Qed from Ahmad Shdh Durrani iuto Kotaha where 7,000 Chauhdns 
were massacred by the imperial forces under the Rai of Kotaha. 

In Hissar the true Chauh^ns are immigrants and may be divided into 
two branches, the Nimr5,na"^ and Sidhmukh or, as they call themselves, 
Bclril Thai. The Nimran^s who are descendants of Rdja Sangd,t, a 
great-gTandyon of Chahir Deo, brother of Pirthi Raj, are sub-divided into 
two clans, Rath and Bagauta, both of which came from Gurgdon, the 
former tracing their origin to Jatusana. The name Bdgauta would 
appear to be connected with Bighota.f 

The Bant, Thai had a group of 12 villages near Sidhmukh in Bikaner, 
close to a famous shrine of Gugra. 

The Sohu and Chotia Pachadas claim Chauhan descent. 

The Chauhans own a few villages to the south of Delhi city and have 

a small colony near Jakhauli in Sonepat talisil, but in this District 

they have adopted widow reman'iage and are disowned by their fellow 

Rajpnts, but they are the best cultivators of the tribe, and otherwise 

- decent and orderly. 

In the central and some western Districts the Chauhdns are found 
classed indifferently as Rajput or Jat, e. g., in Sialkot.;]: 

In Amritsar they are classed as an agricultural tribe (Rajput, Jat and 
Gujar), and they are also so classed in Montgomery (Rajput and Jat) 
and in Shdhpur. 

In Bahdwalpur the Chauhdns have three clans : — Khalis ; Hamshira 
[found mainly in Uch feskhdH — they claim that Muhammad Husain, 
their ancestor, was Akbar'&i foster-brother [liamshir), but others say they 
are Hnshmiras not Hamshiras] ; and Khichchi, who claim to be 
descended from Khichchi Khan, ruler of Ajmer 700 years ago, and say 
their ancestor founded Shergadh in Montgomery. Few in number they 
are confined to the hdrdd.ri of Khairpur Bast, where they are carpenters 
and khatiks by trade, though in Multdn they are well-to-do landowners. 

Numerous Jat and other tribes comprise Chauhdn sections or have 
sections which claim Chauhdn descent, indeed it would be difficult to 
name a large caste in the Punjab which has not a Chauhdn section, e.g. 
see Chamdr. The Kichi and Varaich are also numerous Chauhan 
clans in the Punjab. For the general history of the Chauhans and 
their organisation see Rajput.

MISCELLANEA. 



CHEYLA. 



'L'his would appear to be the form under wbicli 
this wcll-kuown word iisiially appeared to the 
Anglo- Indian of a century ago. It was then in 
common use in senses which are not to be found 
in Yule's Hohson-Jobson, nor curiously enough in 
any of the Indian Dictionaries available to me. 
Originally a Hindu word meaning a ' servant,' 
many changes have been rung upon it in Hindu 
life, so that it has meant a slave, a household slave, 
a family retainer, an adopted member of a great 
family, a dependant relative and a soldier in its 
secular senses ; a follower, a pvipil, a disciple and a 
convert in its ecclesiastical senses. It has passed 
out of Hindu usage into Muluimmadan usage with 
much the same meanings and ideas attached to it, 
and has even meant a convert from Hinduism to 
Islam . 

In the last century, persons bearing the title — 
it can hardly be called the stigma — of chela 
played so important a part in current politics, and 
the word was so familiar in its applied senses, that 
to the Anglo-Indian of that day it i-equired no 
reference and no explanation, though nowadays 
some of the secondary senses have become so far 
forgotten that the modern Dictionaries have 
missed them, and so comprehensive a work as 
Burnell's and Yule's Hohson-Johaon has failed to 
record it. 

I, therefore, make no apology for the lengthy 
quotations which follow to prove the uses to 
which it has been put, and giving its history for 
the last four centuries. R. 0. Temple.

Hindu Usage. 

1821. — " We saw a little monastery of Atteets, 
founded by the chiefs of Bhynsror. It is called 
Jhalaca .... The head of the establishment, 
a little vivacious, hot, wild-looking being, about 
sixty years of age, came forth to bestow his 
blessing and to beg something for his order. He, 
however, in the first place elected me one of his 
chelae or disciples by marking my forehead with 
a tika of hhaboot, which he took from a platter 
made of dhak-lenves, to which rite of inauguration 
I submitted with due gravity." — Tod, Rajasthan, 

Vol. i6.,j3. G12- 

1832. — "It was one day remarked that, when 
refreshing in the coond or reservoir, Sirdar Sing 
lob. 1782] did not lay aside his turban, which 
l^rovoked a suspicion that he had no hair. The 
Rana [Raja of Mewar], impatient to get a peep. at 
the bare head of the son of Chandrabhan, proposed 
that they should push each other into the water. 
The sport began, and the Dodeah's turban falling 
oS disclosed the sad truth. The jest was, however, 
not relished by the Sirdar, and he tai-tly replied in 
answer to his sovereign's question, 'what had 
become of his hair ?,' that ' he had lost it in his 
service in a former birth as chela by carrying 
■wood upon his head to feed the tlame when his 
sovereign as a jogi or ascetic performed penance 
[taiyasya) on the hills of Budrinath .... Chela 
is a phrase which includes servitude or domestic 
slavery : but implies at the same time treatment as 
a child of the family. Here it denotes that of 
a servant or disciple." — Tod, BajastJian, Vol. ii., 
fp. o27/. a/iti 528h. 

1874. — "The menials [of Bikanir] are heredi- 
tary household slaves called ' chelas.' They 
are, I believe, never sold by RajpOt families of 
distinction, though they often form part of a 
liride's dowry. When not the children of slaves, 
they have usually been purchased in times of 
famine from their starving relations. Their work 
is light, and they are generally well treated, and 
sometimes placed in positions of high trust. But 
Thakurs, especially the inferior ones, occasionally 
act with much cruelty towards their slaves as 
well as their other dependants. ' Chelas' who 
have fled from theii- masters are to be met with 
in British territory, where they often assume the 
caste of their former owners. The term ' chela ' 
signifies disciple rather than slave, and was 
applied to household servants by the large- 
minded Akbar .... whether in the use 
of this word the Rajpats were taught by Akbar or 
he by them, I cannot at present say : — [here is

are as follow : — .... Infantry .... 
Paltans, 1st, Gol Paltan (under a ' kh&sehela ' or 
household slave; 2n(l, imder a ' nS-nk&rehela ' 
or slave holding grant of land; 3rd, under a 
household slave)." — Powlett, Karauli, p. 40. 

1878. — " Bakhtawar Singh [of Ulwur] died in 
1815 .... Banni Singh, then seven years 
old, was accepted as Raja by the Rajpiits and 
artillery [golanddz) headed by Akhe Singh 
Bankawat and an influential chela or household 
slave named Ramii .... Ramft and Ahmad 
Bakhsh [Khan, Vakil, afterwards Nawab of 
Firozpur and Lobar u] each tried to obtain for 
their respective parties the support of the Delili 
Resident, Sir David Ochterlony .... Ramil 
the faithful old chela died in 1825. His son 
Mulla had established a great influence over the 
young chief, and on the whole this influence was 
used for good, for he was kept under restraint and 
compelled to acquire some education". But Mnlla 
treated him sometimes with such indignity as to 
excite the anger of the Rajpiits and at last Akhe 
Singh had Mulla murdered to the extreme grief 
and displeasure of Banni Singh who expelled 
Akhe Singh from Ulwiu'." — -Powlett, Ulwur, p. 23-

1878. — " The household slaves or Khawas 
Chelas [of Ulwur] number about 200 .... 
Though known generally as kha'was chelas, the 
special title of kliavjas, which is an honourable 
distinction, enftbliug the bearer to sit in Darbar 
is borne by only five. Ramtl, the faithful Minister 
and adherent of M. R. Bakhtawar and Banni 
Singh, is the slave most distinguished in the 
history of the State. His family hold a valualiie 
rent-free grant. Khawas Sheo Bakhsh, Superin-

When in 1870 the Council of Administration 
was established and a fixed sum assigned for the 
expenses of the palace, the late chief neglected 
to supply maintenance to. a number of the house-

for the means of support. The Council thought 
the opportunity a good one for permanently 
reducing the number of slaves in the palace and 
so far diminishing the servile influence which was 
the cause of much evil. It was consequently

the other Dharmpflra. Some of AbiVl-Fazl's 
people had the charge and used to spend the king's 
money in procuring food. As the jogis also used 
to flock there in great numbers a separate receiv- 
ing house was built for them and called Jogipiira. 
Nightly meetings were held in private with some 
of these men and they used to employ themselves 
in various follies and extavagrancies in contempla- 
tion, gestures, addresses, abstractions and reveries, 
and in alchemy, fascination and magic. The king 
himself studied alcbemy and used to exhibit the 
gold which he mad^ One night in the year 
called Shivrat was appointed for a grand assembly 
of jogis from all parts of the country, on which 
occasion he would eat and drink with the best of

of a life three or four times longer than the 
natural life of man." — Elliot, Historij of India,

c. 1596. — " The Chelahs or Slaves. His 
Majesty [Akbar] from religious motives dislikes 
the name banclah or slave, for he believes that 
mastership belongs to no one but God. He there- 
fore calls this class of men Chelahs, which Hindi 
term signifies a faithful disciple. Through His 
Majesty's kindness many of them have chosen 
the road to happiness, [by joining the Divine 
Faith] .... The pay of the Chelahs [in

them Cheelah, which word in the Hindowee 
language signifies one who relies on another

one Dam to one Rupee. They are formed into

names and dresses were given them, and they 
were marched about the parade .... [The 
Europeans] all were bound on the parade and 
rings (boly) the badge of slavery were put into

son of a Gond. The second, Jumshei-e Khan, 
was the son of a Gossein ; and the third and fourth, 
Chiitta Khan snd Islam Khan, were the sons of a

Mahomcdan prince another tie to strengthen that 
of adoption.

father and mother to Mandah, where they place 
his sword and shield on Daler Khan's tomb. 
They make an offering and the boy then girds on 
the sword and takes up the shield, while the 
parents pray that he may be brave as Daler 
Khan. Kettle drums are regularly beaten at the 
tomb." — Irvine, Bam/ash Nawahs, in J. A. S. B.,

tions regarding Daler Khan, see note C. p. oQhff. 

1878. — " [In 1727] Bhure Khan Chela now 
placed himself at the head of a number of brave 
Pathans and penetrated the enemy's army, 
intending to kill Chattarsal. Bhure Khan lost 
his own life instead .... For the loss of 
Bhure Khan the Nawab [Muhammad Khan of 
Farrukhabad] wept and for many days after the 
battle wore orange-coloured clothes in sign of 
mourning, saying — ' "What Bhure said was true ; 
he said he would die before me.' " — Irvine, 
Bangasli Naumhs, in J. A. S. B., Vol. xlvii.,i\ 293. 

1878. — "[In 1729] the Bibl Sahiba mother of 
Kaim Khun, hearing rejiorts of intended treach- 
ery sent Neknam Khan Chela to Faizabad. 
^ , . . . The same day Kaim Khan and 
Neknam Khan visited 'Abdul- Mansiir Khan and 
asked leave to depart. 'Abdul-Mansiir Khan pro- 
posed their waiting for the troops he had .'^ent for, 
who would arrive in a few days. Neknam Khan 



deliver IMuliammad Kliiin by their means.' He 
then in a, great rage lead Kaim Khan I>y the hand 
out of the audience hall. With them were 60 
Pathans clad in chain mail, whose orders were to 
strike at once if any one lifted a finger to touch 
them." — Irvine, Bang ash Nawahs, in J. Ai !S. B., 
Vol. xlvii., p. 300. 

1878. — "Nawab Muhammad Khan to the last 
maintained very plain and soldier-like habits 
. . . . In his audience halls and in his house 
the only carpet consisted of rows of common 
mats and on them the Pathans and chelas and 
all jjersons high or low had to be content to sit 
. . . . when any noble visited the Nawab 
no change was made, the same mats were sj^read 
to sit on and the same food presented .... 
Then for each day after their arrival the Nawab 
would name some chela to entertain the visitor 
sumptuously. [Then follows a story of Nawab 
Umdatul-Mulk Amir Khan and his extravagant 
entertainment by Ja'far Khan Chela]. " — 
Irvine, Bangasli Nawahs, in J. A. 8. B., Vol. xlvii., 
p. 338/. 

1878. — " Slavery is a part of the Muhammadan 
legal system, but there must be, I think, few 
instances, in Avhich it has been carried to the 
length practised by Muhammad Khiin. Slaves 
were preferred to eqiials or relations as deputy 
governors of provinces, slaves led his armies, he 
even kept a bodyguard of slaves. 

One of the i-easons assigned for this preference 
is the trouble given by his brother Pathans of 
Man. Many of them at one time had farming 
leases of parganahs. If the Nawab complained 
of embezzled revenue, their answer was, that they 
would fight, but not pay. If one of them was 
imprisoned as a defaulter, all the other Pathans 
rose in arms till he was released. For this reason 
it is said, some years after his rise to power, the 
Nawab remitted large sums to Afghanistan, and 
induced a colony of the Bangash tribe to emigrate 
and settle in the city of Farrukhabad. From 
among them he selected eighteen leaders as 
Jam'adars. They were petted in every way, the 
Nawab looking on them as his own right arm, 
and to them his daughters were given in marriage. 
He gave them land for their houses on the side of 
the city nearest to the Ganges, and the quarter to 
this day bears the name of Bangashpura. 

Another expedient resorted to was to seize the 
sons of Kajpiits and Brahmans, who were then 
made into Muhammadans. Some were obtained 
by consent, some by payment; others were the 



August, 1S96.] 



were tlius obtfiined and tauglit the precepts of 
Islam. From them were selected the leaders of 
the army, and the collectors of land revenue in 
the panjunahs. 

Muhiimmad Khan had quite a passion for 
increasing the number of his chelas. All his 
managers '^Amils) and deputies (Siibahdars) had 
orders to send him all the Hindu boys, whom 
they could procure between the ages of seven and 
thirteen. When they grew up, they were placed 
in his police or army, or were appointed to 
manage the Nawab's j^rivate affairs. When even 
;in amil had a fight with a troublesome village 
or invested it, he seized all the boys he could get, 
and forwarded them to the Nav.ab. Others 
l)ecame Miihammadans of their owu accord. In 
this way, evei*y year one or two hundred boys 
were made Muhammadans, and by tlie end of his 
life the Nawab had some four thousand chelas • 
Many of these were killed in battle in the Nawab's 
lifetime, many died without issue, and many 
were never married. The descendants of the rest 
still exist, and are distinguished as G-hazanfar- 
bachha (progeny of Ghazanfar), the title of 
Muhammad Khan having been Ghazanfar Jang. 
During the Nawab's lifetime these men were 
never styled chelas, they v/ere always know^n 
as Tifli-Sirkar (sous of the State). All places 
of trust were given to them, the Nawab's house- 
bold was in their charge, and his whole establish- 
ment under their orders. For many of them 
he obtained the title of Waw^ab from the 
emperor. Of whatever caste a chela had been, 
he was married to the daughter of a chela 
originally of the same caste, a Rajput was given 
to a Rajput, a Brahman to a Brahman, and so 
forth. This plan was followed till the time of 
Nawab Ahmad Khan Ghalib Jang (1752-1771). 
After that time they all got mixed together, so 
that one caste cannot be distinguished from 
another. Among the chelas were the sons of 
powerful Rajahs, who by misfortune had been 
captured and made Muhammadans. Thus 
Shamsher Khan ' Masjidwala' is reported to have 
been a Banafir Rajput, Sher Dil Klian was a 
Tomar, Pur Dil Khan a Gaur, Daud Khan a 
Brahman, and so forth. 

The Nawab used to tell his chelas to collect as 
much money, goods or jewels as possible. In 
adversity such property could be made o£ use to 
him or themselves. But he who built a masonry 
structure in any village would be at once removed 
from employment. Nothing was to be built but 
with sun-dried bricks and mud mortar, and to 
ench chela permission was given to build a single 
brick room as reception hall. The only excep- 



tion was in favour of Yakut Khan, Khan Bahadui", 
of whom we will speak again presently. 

A teacher was appointed for the boy chelas, 
his name was Kali Miyan Shah. When a boy 
could read and write, ho was taken before the 
Nawab, who presented him with one hundred 
rupees, a shield, and a sword, by way of khila't. 

From among the chelas of eighteen to 
twenty years of age, the Nawab selected five 
hundred youths, and trained them as a picked 
regiment. They had firelocks of Lahore, accou- 
trements of Sultani broad-cloth, powder-horns 
each holding two and a half seers of powder, and 
each a pouch with one hundred bullets. One 
day, they were drawn up along the Jamna bank 
under the fort at Delhi while the emperor was 
seated on the fort wall, with Muhammad Khiin 
standing in an attitude of respect beside him ; 
Muhammad Shah ordered him to fire at some 
moving object in the river, and was so delighted 
with the good practice they made, that he asked 
for a gift of the whole coi-ps. — Muhammad 
Khan made the ol>jection that they Avere a lot 
of Brahmans and Rajputs, who could do nothing 
but talk a rustic patois and use their swords. 
The emperor accepted the excuse, and sent one 
thousand rupees to be distributed." — Irvine, 
Bangash Naivahs, in J. A. S. B., Vol. xlvi., 
p. 3^0/. 

1378. — [Mr. Irvine gives the facts known about 
47 of the principal chelas, from which it will 
be sufficient to extract the following as illustra- 
tive of the subject in hand.] "{I) Yakut Khan, 
Khan Bahadur .... Seven ganjes [an 
interesting Anglo-Indian form on its own

to these chelas that they will never respect me.' 
Mhd. Khan got np in a rage and went off 
to his house at Aniethi. Mhd. Khiin then 
scolded Bhure Kluin sa3'ing that he had lost 
confidence in him, for if while he was alive they 
did not respect his sous, who knew what they 
would do when he was dead. Bhure Khan 
putting up his hands said :— ' May God Almighty

1878. — [In 1748, on receipt of the erpperor 
Ahmad Shah of Dehli's farmdn to attack the 
Rohelas, in the days of Nawab Kaim Khan] 
" the principal leaders were then sent for to be 
consulted. Chief among them was Mahmud 
Afridi the Bakhshi and others. These all voted 
for immediate war, but the Nawab seems to have 
been reluctant to attack his fellow Pathans. 
Shuja't Khan Ghilzai, who had formerly 
exchanged turbans with 'All Mhd. Khan Roliela, 
Takut Khan Khan Bahadur, Shamsher Khan, 
Mukim Khan, Islam Khan, Kamal Khan, and 
Sardar Khan, ehelas, represented to the Nawab 
that the Rohelas were not his enemies." — Irvine, 
Bangash Nawabs, in J. A.S.B., Vol. xlvii.,p. 377.

sent one of his father's ehelas, whom he trusted, 
his name was Bhiire Khan, with five hundred 
matchlock-men to take possession of Kannauj 
. . . . Rahm Khan Chela used to say 
that his father Dikiwar Khan, then very young, 
visited Kannauj a few days after the battle and at 
the commander's invitation he went into the Rang 
Mahal. There were no people in it, but bags 
of rupees and gold coins were scattered about

Nawab Ahmad Khan made about three or four 
hundred Hindu boys into chelas. Those who 
had charge of his territory acquired wealth : the 
rest who received only pay and gifts rose to no 
eminence. They were all known as Ghalib 
Bachha. (1) Zu'lfikar Khan. In Ahmad Khan's 
time there were three men known as Nawabs, at

i-estrictious of Hindu caste were until Nawab 
Ahmad's time [1750-71] observed. During the 
reign of Nawab Muhammad [1713-43] they 
were never called ehelas or disciples, liut always 
children of the State (atfal-i-sarkar). Their

Fakhruddaula [a chela], whose first task was to

Mhd.'s officers were forbidden to erect any 
structure more lasting than mud or sun-dried

hall one kiln-brick chamber ; but any further 
dabbling in bricks and mortar was the prero- 
gative of the Nawab alone. In Yakut's case, 
however, the prohibition was removed. The Nawab 
remarked that he could never have children, and 
that it did not much matter what buildings he 
left to revert to the State on his death. Yakut

Chet-rami. — The name of a sect founded by one Clict Ram, an Arora of 
Buchhoke, which is still the central sanctuary of the sect, though its 
monastic headquarters are outside the Taxali Gate at Lahore. Chet Earn 
became a disciple of Mahbub Sliah, a J'dl'dlifaqir, of the Chishtia sect. 
After his death Chet Ham slept upon his tomb and there had a vision 
of Christ which is described in a Panjdbi poem, partly composed by him, 
partly by his successors or follower3. On his death in 1894 Chet Ram 
was cremated and his ashes drunk in water by his euthusiastic dis' 
ciples. Before dying he had designated the site of a future Chet-rdmi 
town to be called Isapuri or ' Jesus' town,' and there his bones and 
those of Mahbub Shah are to find their eventual resting-place. Re- 
garding the creed of the sect Dr. H. D. Griswoid writes:* — "The 
Chet-rami sect holds a double doctrine of the Trinity. There is 
the Christian Trinity consisting of Jesus, the son of Mary, the 
Holy Spirit, and God, which is found in the Chet-nlmi creed. 
There is also what might be called a Hindu Trinity consisting of 
Allah, Parmeshwar, and Khudd. Allah is the Creator, Parmeshwar, 
the Preserver, and Khuda, the Destroyer. This idea is, of course, 
based upon the Hindu doctrine of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva as 
Creator, Preserver and Destroyer, respectively. The three potencies 
of the universe, namely AlUh, Parmeshwar, and Khuda have their 
counterpart in the human body, which, from this point of view, is a 
kind of microcosmos. There is a generative part corresponding to 

y Allah, a nourishing part (the breast) corresponding to Parmeshwar, 
and a destroying part (the head) corresponding to Khuda." The 
Chet-ramis frequently carry a long rod surmounted by a cross, on 
which is inscribed their confession of faith. Some form of baptism 
also appears to be practised, but they distinguish between the external 
and internal rite, and are said to have four kinds of outward baptism, 
with water, earth, air and fire. Earth-baptism is used when a lay 
member tears off his clothes, casts dust upon his head and becomes 
a Chet-rd,mi monk, to mark his renunciation of the world. The monks 
are tho clergy of the sect, the theory being that 40 persons arc always 
to subsist on alms and preach the doctrines of Chet Rdm. These 40 
are called chclas and are addicted to intoxicating drugs. The sect is 
probably not very numerous, ai-d it is said to be persecuted by both 
Hindus and Muhammadans, though, when a chela begs of a Hindu he 
does so in tho name of Ram, and when from a Muhammadan in the 
name of AlUh and Muhammad. All castes, even the lowest 
are recruited, but caste distinctions are at least so far observed that

Chhabri, a Gujar clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Chhadhak. Found along the whole length of the Chendb and Ravi 
valleys, but far most numerous in Jhang, where they for the most 
part reo-ard themselves as Rajputs, the Chhadhars claim to be descended 
from Rajii Tur, Tunwar. They say that they left their home in 
Rdiputtina in the time of Muhammad of Ghor, and settled in Bahawalpur, 
where they were converted by Sher Slulh of Uch. Thence they came to 
Jhano- where they founded an important colony and spread in smaller 
numbers up the Chenab and Rdvi. Steedman describes them as good 
ao-riculturists, and less given to cattle-theft than their neighbours. 
Mr. E. D. Maclagan spells the name Chaddrar, which is undoubtedly 
the correct form, and writes : — 

" The Chaddrars are Tunwars. Their chief tribes in the Sandal Bar 
are the Rajokes, Kamokes, Jappas, Luns, Pajikes, Deokes, Ballankes, 
Saiokes, etc. The Chaddrars of the B^r are said to have expanded 
from Dhdban, a small rahna or encampment south-west of Khurid,nwdla. 
The Luns of iwanwala in the Bar say they have been there for seven 
generations. At Bajla rahna there is a separate class of Luns or 
Lunas called Bala Luns, who celebrate marriages, wash the dead and 
• so forth, and act more or less as mullas '\

' Tunwar then became, strong. 
From which family Tara was born ; 
K4ja Ravilan was a fine hero. 
Who builfc the fort of Delhi ; 
Ho built Delhi Fort so 
That his name of a certainty was soondod

Secondly, when he had cleared a wido

He fixed the namo of Chaddrar. 
His name was established and grew from 
day to day. 

He worshipped God and his Prophet. 
A ruler came and ruled. 
The whole country called for help. 
The Chhattis-Paintis and the Luu country, 
Carried rupees to the home of the Chad-

With only half a hand the Chaddrara took 
Nakodar 

And made tha Diniar-des do obeisance. 
First they went to Gagiana (in the Bar) 
and settled, 

Then they reached Lahore. 
When they quarrelled with the Kharrals, 
They stripped the Kharrals of their throne. 
With a push of the shoulder (i.p., with a 
certain amount of trouble) they took Chiniot. 
They used more force. 
They killed Malik Macche Rhan. 
They hai'ried and destroyed him. 
The Chiiddrars were rulers on both sides 
of the river (ChenAb). 

They put the Siala' daughters on rafts and 
dragged them away. 

They cleared a wido road of {i.e., dis-

The Prophet held his canopy over them. 
Hambi (a Chaddrar) lived on the Chitrang

And divided his sliare fully. 
The Jappas' line was also good, 
And separated off a share. 
Thpy met the Bulghan Bilocheg. 
They boat and defeated the Biloches. 
They fed in common, but their share was

They fought to their hearts' content.

The Rdjoke Chaddrars once got hold of a Mughal empercfr's 

elephant and yoked it to a well at a place near Kliurid,nwd,la, still 

called the Hilthi Tlieh. The following- clicip on the subject was given 
by the Mird,si /a^i'r at Shaikh Sd^bu : —

CbhAjju, Chhajju-pantbi. — A sect which exhibits a curious combination of the 
Hindu and Muhammadan creeds among the lower orders. It is said to 
have been founded by Chhajju, a hhagat of Lahore, who lived about the 
time of Aurangzeb.* His followers buj-n their dead, but do not throw the 
ashes into the Ganges ; they take them to a place called Parnaji, in Bundel- 
khand, where they bury them. They believe in the divine mission of Mu- 
hammad, but have no social intercourse with the Muhammadans. One of 
their sacred ^ilaces is Malka Hans, in the Pakpattan tahsil of Montgomery, 
where their mahant, Lachhman Das, lives, and their sacred book is kept 
in a kind of temple. It is called the Kul Jama Banip, is written in 
Bhdsha, and its doctrines are based on a mixture of Hinduism and the 
Quran. They also have adherents at Qabula Tibbi and Harappa, and 
are said to be strong vegetarians and teetotallers. 

Chhajra. a tribe of J^ts who claim descent from the royal race of the 
Bhattis of Jaisalmer. They came to Multan under Kao Kehar, a chief- 
tain of their own, and settled there. Kehar is a name of note in Bhatti 
annals. One Eehar was contemporary of the Khalifa-ul-Walid, a.d. 
713.t He and his sons advanced the Bhatti kingdom of Jaisalmer. 
Another Kehar ruled Jaisalmer in the sixteenth century, and his son 
conquered all the Multdn country up to the Indus. The Chhajrda 
marry their daughters to their own tribesmen only, but receive the 
daughters of other Jd,t tribes in marriage.

called Qalandars. But this seems to be an absolute fable. That they 
came from the Mewat may be conceded, but, in spite of what they

Ghhalapddr rites. ICI 

say, it is probable that they are Hindu converts to Isldm, and that ia 
their former faith they were temple musicians or wandering minstrels. 
On the conversion of the Mewd,t their deities were overthrown, but the 
spirit of idolatory which remained, and is not yet quite extiuct, set up 
Muhammadan pirs in their stead, and they found employment in dedi- 
cating themselves to these saints. But it is doubtful whether they 
were ever really attached to the shrines of the saints to whom thoy 
are dedicated, viz., KhwAja Moin-ud-Din of Ajraer, Badi-ud-Din 
or Maddr Sahib,* or Saiyid Sdldr Masaud Ghazi, known as the 

* Bd,ld Mij'dn.' The Mujawars belonging to these shrines are of 
authenticated descent and certainly of higher status than the 
Cbhalapdars, who derive their name from cJihalap, the musical 
instrument which they carry and which is in itself a sign of low 
social status. That they call themselves Mujd,wars may be taken 
as a mere attempt to claim a higher origin, though they certainly 
take upon themselves certain duties comiectcd with the anniversaries 
of their saints, especially at Delhi, where they are to be seen 
wanderingf from house to house as harbingers of the approaching 
ceremonies, and singing songs to the accompaniment of the chhalap 
in praise of their saints. The anniversary of the first-named saint, 
who is the most reverenced of them all, is held at Ajmer from 
the 1st to the 6th of Rajab, when thousands from all parts of India 
gather at Ajmer. When there were no railways, people used to start 
on this journey weeks and even months beforehand, so that tbo 
month preceding Rajab actually came to be called ' the month of 
Khwdja Moin-ud-Din.^ On the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month 
large numbers from the Mcwat, and the countryside generally, assemble 
at the Qutb, 11 miles from Delhi (which, as the name signifies, is the 
shrine of Khwaja Qutb-ud-Din, the chief disciple of the Ajmeri 
Khwdja) for throe days, which are observed as great holidays. On the 
16th this great concourse forms a huge caravan which sets out on its 
way to Ajmer. Even now the journey is mostly performed on foot, 
though bullock carts are also employed, chiefly for the women. The 
sight is picturesque and interesting, young and old being dressed in 
their best attire ; trains of chhaJcras (country carts) which carry the 
thousands of women and children, singing to the accompaniment of 
drums, flutes and all kinds of instruments. A conspicuous feature of 
the procession is the red and green banners and flags, called chliaridn 
(lit. * sticks'), to which the three days' gathering at the Qutb owes its 
name of the chhnrlou hi mela or 'fair of the flags', which are 
moi'o precisely called Khwaja ji ki chharian. In the preparation and 
erection of these .flags and in the ceremonies connected with them 
the Chhalapdcirs arc the principal actors. The flags look like so many 

* On the first day of Jamadf-ulawal, also called the tiionth of Madar, when tho baiinera 
or c/i/Kt)td7is of Mad4r were eroctod under tho walla of Delhi tho Chhalapdirs, accom- 
panied by a band of drummers, used to appear with Madar's banner before the emperor 
in his court of private audience, and on th^sir arrival ho came out of the palace and hia 
attendants used to give them trays of malidah, the Chhalapdars in return jjlHcing a bnddi 
or garland on tho emperor's body in memory of the Saint, Madar. Prayers were tlion 
offered in the name of the saint and tho malidah was doled out to all present. After tliis 
the king gave the Chhalapdars a standard from tho top of wliich hung a cloth called 
pharaira, embroidered with gold (called task or tamdmi, cto.) to the loose ends of which 
were attached silver cups or katoras. This standard was given to tho Chhalapdars in oidur 
that it might be preeented at the coDvent of Madar Sahib in tbo king's behalf. 



162 Chhalapddr rites. 

sfcanclards, distinguisbing the various bands and contingents whicli form 
the great Khwaja's camp or laahkar. Tlicy aro gaudily draped, have 
guilded tops, and aro garlanded with flowers, which have pecuHar 
names. The cloth, and even fragments of it, after having been once 
twisted round the stick are considered to be not only sacred, but 
possessed of healing virtues, and aro eagerly sought after, especially 
by mothers who cause them to be worn by their children, if sick or 
otherwise in danger, in order to get them cured. They collect women 
of their kith and kin, form a procession headed by the men beating 
drums, and follow them singing the Khwaja's praises, till they reach 
one of these flags, to which they make offerings of sweetmeats, pice 
and cowries and sometimes even rupees, the whole being the per- 
quisite of the Chhalapdars, who are in proprietary charge of the sticks. 
A portion of the sweetmeat, after it has been offered, is returned to 
those who bring it and also distributed among any others present. 
Sometimes this ceremony is performed at the bouse of the child's 
parenta, in which case the Chhalapdd,r takes his stick or flag there and 
bbe rite is gone through mjdst the singing of the child's relatives and 
with great festivities. In some cases the ceremony of putting on the 
garlands and draping a child in the cloth of a flag is repeated yearly 
during its minority, or until the term of years, for which its parents had 
vowed to perform it, has expired. 

For three days the scene at Qutb is most noisy and the din of the vocal 
and instrumental music of innumerable processions passing through 
the streets and crossing each other is enhanced by the noise and rowdy- 
ism of the jumping Darweshes called Qalandars. In front of every 
shop and place where a rustic fan^ily is staying during the fair, as well 
as around every stick or flag erected by Chhalapdars, groups of these 
Qalandars may be seen marking time with tbeir feet which movement 
by degrees rises into high jumps. Their chorus,* while they are thus 
jumping, is— 

Mast Qalandar ! Allah hi degd I ! 

Tdrnhe kd paisd ! Allah hi degd ! ! 

JDudh malidah ! Allah hi degd ! ! 

Dham Qalandar ! Dudh malidah ! ! Allah hi degd ! ! ! 

and so on. 

•* O Darwesh free and drunk ! God will give it ! Copper coin ! God 
will give it! Milk and malidahl God will give it ! Jump Qalandar! 
God will give milk and malidah ! (lit., a sweet dish)." 

This is repeated again and again until the shopkeeper or the person 
or family addressed, gives them somethiug in cash or kind taking 
which they mov(! on to jump before others. 

In all the songs sung by the Chhalapdars, and others generally, on this 
occasion the Kbwaja's praises are the principal theme. The following 
which forms the burden of a popular song is given here as a speci- 
men : — 

3Iere dil darydo Khwdja ! Tere jhalare pe Idgi hai hhir. " My bounti- 
ful river-like KhAvaja ! Look what a concourse of people (with eager 
prayers) has assembled at thy jhalara."i 

* Sung in a loud and emphatic voice, 
t Jhalara is a large spring at the shrine of the Khwaja at Ajmer. 



Chhdligar'^Chhaner. 163 

The second fair of flags is hold in honour of Mad^r Siihib below the 
walls of the fort or red palace of Shah Jaluin ia Delhi. It is similar to 
the Olio de^^cribed above, with this diiforenro, that it is less attended 
and the flags are taken to the tomb of tlie saint at Makkinpur. One of 
the songs (or sohlds as tliey are called) snug bj the Chhalapd;irs which 
refers to Madiir Sahib is : — Lei t.o chaloji luilama Makkinpur ? In this 
song a newly married girl implores hor hnsljand to take her with him to 
Makkin])ur. These fairs are especially popular among the women. 

The third fair is held in honour of 'BalaMiydn' Saiyid Sdldr Masaud 
Ghdzi, who is said to have lost his life in one of the early wars of the 
Musalmi'ms with the idokitrous Hindus. lie was young and about to 
be married, but foiight bravely and died in the hour of victory. As 
in tiie case of the second fair, the chharidn are erected under 
the walls of the Dellii Fort. One of the songs sung in praise of Saiyid 
S^diir runs : — Merd nit hanra Sdldr hdld ! Bald merd jdgo nd : " My 
bridegroom ever young, the young Salar, whj'- does he not awake ? " 

The Chhalapddrs say they have no chaudhri, but a imnchdyat system 
is iu vogue among them. A transgressor is punished with a fine of 10 or 
12 annas with which sweetmeats are purchased and distributed among 
the jianchs. In extreme cases he is punished by temporary excom- 
munication. Marriages are confined to the community. The niMh is 
in vogue, but the bride's dower does not exceed the legal minimum 
under Muhammadan Law. The ceremonies connected with birth 
and marriage, such as sachaq, chauthi, etc., and those observed till 40 
days after death are the same as those of the other Dellii Muliam- 
madans. Widow remarriage is not unlawful, and a deceased brother's 
widow may be taken in marriage. Some of the Chhalapdiirs' songs are :— 

(1) Sung on the bridegroom's side: — Apne Hary die lane pe main 
chunchun wdrun gi Icalydn! Merd jiice hana! Ajjne Earydle bane pe 
main, etc. " I will pick the choicest flowers and shower them upon my 
dear bridegroom, the beloved of God ! May he live long." 

(2) Sang on the bride's side :~Meri acchchi hano sohdg hanri ! " My 
good, and of her husband most beloved, bride ! 

(3) Sung at a hirlh .-'—Aye Idl re tere hath men jhunjhuna. "0 my 
pretty little baby, with a rattle {jhunjhuna) in thy hand." 

One of the ceremonies observed prior to birth is held when the 
woman has been enceinte for 7 months. It is called sath ivdnsd or * the 
custom of the 7th month.' 

The Chhalapdars say that they also sing the praises of Saiyid Ahmad, 
surnamed Kabir.

Chhazanq. — A term confined in the Punjdb to the Buddhists of Spiti, among 
whom caate was said to be unknown. It includes all the land-owning 
classes of Spiti, where everybody except Hesis and Lohd,rs owns land. 
The Chhdzang are by nationality Tibetan, or as they call them- 
selves, Bhoti, and Chdhzang means the land-holding class, and the people 
towards Tibet, Laddkh, and Zanskd,r are known as Chhdzang. It 
appears to be used in a very wide sense to mean all who speak Bhoti, 
just as Monpa means ' the people that do not know,' that is, the 
Hindus. 

Mr, A. H. Diack, a high authority on Spiti thus described the 
tribal system in that country, where four grades of society are re- 
cognised : — 

" (i). Jo or !r90.*— This is a title enjoyed for his lifetime by one who 
marries the daughter of any high-class family, such as that 
of the Nono of Spiti or the Thakur of Lahul, or any family 
of equal importance in Laddkh or Tibet. 

(ii). Lonpo. — This term is applied to the class not so high as the Jo 
or as low as the Chha-zang. Lonpo means ' minister' and 
is an hereditary title and office. Lohrag and Da-tong-kar- 
po (Dhongrukdru) are said to be synonyms for Lonpa. 

(iii). Chhd-zang. — The word means * middle-class,'t ['good 
position'] as opposed on the one hand to 'Tarap,' or high- 
class, such as members of the family of the Nono of Spiti, 
and on the other to ' Marap,' or Mow class,' which includes 
the blacksmiths, Hesis, etc. 

{iv). Lohon. — The word means ' teacher,' and is probably the des- 
cription given of himself by some wandering Tibetan 
pilgrim. Tliere was some difficulty in ascertaining the 
'caste' of Tibetan pilgrims at the census of 1891. They 
treated the question as a joke, and returned themselves 
as " stones,"" or articles of wearing apparel,t and the like. 

Tribal distinctions are recognized in Spiti, the chief being the 
following : — (l)Nandu, (2) Gyazhingpa, (3) Khyungpo, (4) Lon-chhenpo, 

* See under Nouo for the precise meaning of this term. Mr. Diack also added that the 
same name is borne by the lady whose marriage has invested her husband with the title, 
but the ffiminine form is generally jo-j'o. The chil iren of the union do not eujoy the title, 
Jo and Tiio (Cho) are synonyms. This however is contradictud by later information from 
Spiti, (See under Jo.) 

I Mr. Diack refers to the Census Report of 1881, § 562. and apparently accepts the 
derivation (given therein) fr. ::ang 'land,' chdh 'owner.' But 'land' =^ ehing, and 
• owner ' is dagpo in Spiti, and the derivation appears to be untenable. 

J Using family names, probably. 



Social grades in Spiti. ] G5 

(5) Hesir, and (6) Nyekpa * Marriage is forbidden within tlio clan but 
one clan intermarries freely with another. A woman on niarryino- is 
considered to belong to her husband's clan and the children of both 
sexes are of the clan of the futhor. The tribes (rto'wa) are not 
local ; members of each may be found in any village. The members 
phaibat, of the clan, wherever they may live, inherit in preference 
to the people of the village, in default of natural heirs. The Lon- 
chhen-pas and the Gyazbingpas are considered somewhat sujierior 
to the others, but my informant, a Spiti man, savs that in his country, 
as elsewhere, wealth is the real criterion of respectability." More up 
to date information sliows that Mr. Diack using (no doubt) a Luhula 
interpreter has confused Ljihula and Spiti nomenclature: the true 
class distinctions are these— 

Laduhh. Ldhul, 8piH. 

I.— Eoyal or noble ... ... r(gyalrig8) ... Jorica Nono. 

11.— Upper official class ... rjeriga ... Lonrigs or Lon- Lonpo. 

chhonpo. 
m.— Farmers or yoomon ... h(mangrigB) ... h(inaDgrig8) ... Chh^zang. 

All these three classes are Nangpa or Chajang, ^insiders.' All 
below them are styled Pipas in Spiti, Chipas in Ldliul, or Tolbevrio-v. 
inLaddkh. ^ '^ 

Mr. Francke describes the Spiti people as divided into three main 
classes : Nono, Chajang and PirA. The older accounts averred that 
only in the lower ]iarts of Spiti must menials provide their own stems 
for the common huga, which in the upper part was us^d by all without 
distinction of rank. Tliis is now indignantly denied, and, it is said 
a nangpa or commoner will carefully remove the stem from a nono's 
(noble's) pipe and 'start' it with hi'^ mouth. As a fact any one, bxcoi:)t 
a fipa, may use an ordinary man's pipe, and the nonos admit that if the 
stem were used by an inferior it would only be necessary to wash it. 
The tendency is, however, for etiquette to become stricter. Just as 
the Lahulas have advanced an utterly unfounded claim to be Kanets 
by caste, so the people of Spiti, in the presence of Hindus who 
pride themselves on their caste rules, pretend to caste distinctions of 
their own. 

As to the clan system, it must bo borne in mind that the thino- most 
necessary to ensure in tlie Buddhist world is that when a man dies 
there shall be some one ready to prepare his body for burial. Persons 
reciprocally bound to pc-rform the last offices for each other are called 
phuspun (father-brotherhoods), as well as p)haihat, as they are in 
theory of the same rttVa.t as it is called in Spiti. From this orio-in 
have sprung the clans which are found in every grade of society. 
Such are the Stond-karpo, the Rumpu, the (b)Lonchhenpa or ' great 
ministorR,' the Khyung-buba, the (r)Gyansheba and the Dreba all 
found at Dhankar. Even the fipa class has clans. In marriage the

'bone' must be avoided, just aa in Kullu and the Simla Hills the

that the ' bone brethren ' or fhaibat inherit in preference to any one

Chratar, a tribe of Muhainmadan Jdts found in Gnjrat. Its eponym came 
from Ucli, but his real name is unknown. As a child he visited his 
maternal grandfatiier's house and was weighed against shces fchhatarj 
whence his nickname. 

CHHECHnAK, an Ar<4in clan (agricultural) found in Amntsar. 

Chhelar. a small clan of Jilts whose principal settlement is Chhelar in 
the Ndrnaul tahsil of Nabha. They revere Bhagwan Dd,s, a Hindu 
saint of Mukla in that State, and shave their children at his shrine. 
They avoid tobacco. 

Chhibbar, (1) a section of the Muhidl Brahmans ; (2) a sept of Kanets, who 
give their name to the Chhibrot pargana of Keonthal, to which State 
they migrated from Chittor in Rd,jputiina with its founders. Cf. Balbir. 

Chhibi, Chhibu, syns. of Chhimbd. 

Chhimba. The Chhimbd,, Clihipi or Chhimpi, called Paungar or Charhoa in 
Dera Gh^zi Khd,n, is by occupation a stamper or dyer, but he also turns 
his hand to tailoring or washing. Hence the caste includes the Darzia 
or tailors, the Lildris or dyers, and the Dhobis : ^ also the Chhap^ar.f 
By religion the Chhimbds are mainly Hindus and Muhammadans. 

The Chhimba is properly a calico-printer, and stamps coloured 
patterns on the cotton fabrics of the country, and he is said occasionally 
to stamp similar patterns on paper, but he can hardly be distinguished 
from the Dhobi. Besides printing in colour, he dyes in madder, but as 
a'rule, in no other colour. He is purely an artisan, never being a 
village menial except when a washerman. In some places, though 
not in all, Chhdpegar is used to distinguish those who ornament calico 
with patterns in tinsel and foil only. 

The Hindu Chhimbd,s are divided into two sub-castes, which may not 
intermarry, but may eat and smoke together. J These are the Tank 
and Rhilla. And in Patiala the Hindu Dhobis are said to form a third 
sub-caste. § 

The following legend explains the origin of the two former sub-castes :— 
At Pindlapur in the Deccan hved one Bamdeo, who one night enter- 
tained Krishna and Udhoji, but, as the latter was a leper, the villagers 
ejected them. They were in mdyavi form, and at midnight both of them 
vanished, leaving B^mdeo and his wife asleep. Udhoji hid in a shell 
{sipi), and when Bdmdeo went to wash clothes he found the shell and 
placed it in the sun. It produced the child Nd^mdeo who was fostered 



* Shahpur. 

tSee below. 

t In Patiala the Hindu Dhobi gots are not separately given, and it is said that the Tank 
print cloth, while the RLillas are tailors and the dhobis washermen. 

§ Bat in Maler Kotla the Tauk claim to be of higher status than the Rhilla, and do 
not even eat or Bmoke with them.

by B^mdeo's wife. N^mcloo taught his son Tank, and Rhilla, his 
daughter's son, the arts of dyeing, printing and washing clothes.* 

Territorially the Hindu Chhiuibas have various divisions, e.gf., in Siillkot 
they are divided into the Lahori and Dogra sub-castes, which are 
said not to intermarry and which have separate gats.f In Aniritsar too 
is found a Lahori group, which is also called Chhapagar or Nawandhi.J 
It is looked down upon by the other Chhimbas, who avoid all social 
relations with its nienibers, because at weddings, it is said, they make a 
cow's imago of flour and shoot arrows at it. 

Tho Lahori got a are : — 

1. Pharwain. i 3. Takhtar. 

2. Bagri^ | 4. Ded. 

The Dogra gots are :— 

1. Karaku. 5. Rihania. 9. Chebhc. 

2. Panotra. 6. Pabe. 10. Bhumral. 

3. Dowathia. 7. Saragra. Jl. Tanotra. 

4. Andh. 8. Bagri. 

The Hindu Clihimbiis have few or no special observances at births, etc. 
In or near Delhi after childbirth, if the child be a son, the mother wor- 
ships at a well to which she is taken 1 5 days after her confinement, accom- 
panied by the women of her quarter of the city who sing songs as they 
go. The mother docs obeisance to the well, and thi'ows some sweet stuff 
and rice into it. 

Hindu Chhimbas never grmd turmeric, except at a wedding. They 
will not make harls, and their women avoid wearing kdiich bracelets 
and the use of henna. 

The Hindu Chhimbds§ observe the ordinary Hindu rites, but Namdco, 
tho famous hhagat, is their patron saint, for no bettor reason than that 
he was himself by caste a Chhimbji. Accordingly they pay yearly 
visits to his dera at Ghaman near Amritsar, and oifer him a rupee and 
ndrial at weddings. Sikh Chhimbas appear to favour the tenets of 
Guru R^m Rai. 

The Muhammadan Chhimbas have several territorial divisions, e. g., 
in Patialall there are three, the Sirhindis (cndogamous), the Deswals 
and Multunis,1I who intermarry, as is also tho case in Jind. In Gui-gilon 
the Dcsi Chhimbas are said to be converts from the Tank and Rhilla 



* But in the Maler Kotla version it is said that originally the Chhimbas were a 
homofieneous casfo, until Nanidah (-dc(i) Chhiniba took unto himself two wives, one » 
Chhimba woman, tho other of anolher caste. From tho former sprang the Tank, from the 
latter the lUiiila. Hence tho Tank assert their owu superiority as they are pure 
Chhfmbas, while the Khilla are not. 

t But the Bagri is found in both groups. 

X Nawandhi = of low degree. 

§ In Gurgaon Hindu Chhimbas, who arc very superstitions, worship a Miihammadan'a 
grave, real or supposed, calling it a Sayyid's grave, offering a cock in .'he Sayyid'a uamo 
or a dish of boiled rice at his grave, lest their domestic peace be distarbcd. 

II In this State the Muhammadan Dhobis are said to have five sub-castes — Lahori, 
Sirhindi, Alultani, Purbia and Beswal. Of these the two latter only are found in the State. 
They do not intermarry. The Deswal sections are : — Goriya, Chauban and Kanakfv41 — all 
Ba.iput clans. 

^ For some of their sections see the Appendix.

sub-castes, while the Multd^nis are of the Inroi dan which dwelt in the 
Indus valley and took to printing calico. 

In Leia the saint of the Chliinibas is Ali,the dyer, who is said to have 
been a pupil of Luquian and to have invented washing and dyeing. 
Before beginning work they iuvoke him saying: — Fir ustdd Luqvidn 
Jiakim, hikmat da, hddshdh, All rangrez, chart rahe deg ; i. e., ' Luqmd,n 
the physician is the priest and teacher, the king of craft, and AH is 
the dyer. May his bounty endure for ever.' 

Most Muhammadan Chhimbas arc Sunnis, but in Karor some few are 
Shias. 

The Muhammadan Chhimbas have a loose system of panchdyats, and 
in Dora Ghilzi Khan elders or mahtars are elected by the caste. 

The women of the Muhammadan Chhimbas and Dhobis wear no 
laung (nose-ring), no ivory or glass bangles, or blue clothing. The 
Muhammadan Chhimbcls will not make achdrn or baria ? and avoid 
building a double hearth. 

Chhina, an agricultural clan found in Shd^hpur : also classed as Jat, (agricul- 
tural) in Amritsar. The Chhina are undoubtedly distinct from theChima 
Jats of Sidlkot and Gujranwala, though the two tribes are frequently con- 
fused. That there are Chhina in Sidlkot appears from the fact that the 
town of Jamki in that District was founded by a Chhina Jd,t who came, 
from Sindh and retained the title of Jam, the Sindhi equivalent for 
Chaudhri. Yet if the Chhina spread up the Chenab into Sidlkot and the 
neighbouring Districts in large numbers, it is curious that they should 
not be found in the intermediate Districts through which they must have 
passed. The Chhina are also found in Mianwali and in Bahawalpur 
^5tate. In the latter they are mainly confined to the Minchin^Md 
hdrddri, opposite Pakpattan, and there have three septs, T^reka 
Mahramka and Azamka, which own land. Other septs are tenants.

working, but they are also professional thieves, though they will not 
steal from Sayyids, /a5ir6' or mirdsis, dreading the abuse of the latter. 
Though a small tribe in comparison with the Wattus they will not allow 
the latter to got the upper hand, and if they steal one buffalo from the

The Chilli feudal system. 169 

Chibh.— A Rajput tribe conCnetlj in tlio Punjab, to tlio northern portion 
of Gujrd,t under tlio Jamniu Hills, but also found in tlio hills above 
that tract which belong to tho Kashmir State. It gave its name to 
the Chibhi'il, tho hill country ol: Kashmir on tho left bank of the 
Jholum river along tho Hazara border, though it appears to no 
longer occupy those hills. Tho Chibh claim to be an offshoot, 
at least in the female line, of the Katoch of Kangra, aud their eponym 
Chibh Chand is said to have left Kitngra 14 centuries ago* and settled 
at Maghlora near Bhimbar in tho Jammu Hills, receiving from R/ija 
Sripat of Bhimbai his daughter's hand, with part of his country as her 
dower, t 

The first of the tribe to become a Muhammadan was one Siir 
Sadi, who died a violent death in Aurangzeb's reign. He is 
still venerated as a martyr, and the Muhammadan Chibh offer 
the scalp looks of their male children at his tOTub, till which ceremony 
the child is not considered a true Chibh, nor is his mother allowed 
to eat meat. 

The Chibha had at one time or another a very curious and interest- 
ing feudal organisation, survivals of which are still traceable in ita 
social gradations. Succession to the throne of the Bhimbar kingdom 
was governed by the rule of primogeniture, but younger sons had a 
right to a share and so it would seem that the rnj was divided into four 
onandin — Mahlot, Bund.ila, Kahawalittn and Rajal, and each of these 
great fiefs was held by a " prince of tho blood," the eldest son being 
Kaj^ of Bhimbar, Hence the raj always remained in the family of the 
Ghaniyitl Chibhs, descendants of Ghani Khiin, grandson of Shd,di Khdn, 
the ancestor of all the Muhammadan Chibhs, wlio is identified with the 
martyr Sur Sadi. 

Tho rdj also contained four strongholds, gnrhs, viz., Dewa, Butdhi, 
Ambaridl and Kadhd,la. These garhs were distinct from the mandift 
and were in charge of the Ghaghial, descendants of Ghani Kh^in's 
cousin. Their pre^-ise relation to the mandi'^ is by no means clear, 
but both garhfi and mandifi owed allegiance to the Hdja ; though their 
holders collected their own revenue and were independent in the 
management of their estates. But whatever the precise nature of 
the mandis and garhs may have been, there were also minor fief 9, 
which were bestowed on younger sons : these were 84 in number, at 
least in theory, and were called dhcris. Tho dheris again were classed 
as dheri did, i.e., a fief with a few villages attached to it, and dheri adnd 
or ono which had no dependent villages. 

Accordingly the Chibhs are divided into three grades, Mandidl, Garhiill 
and Dherial, but now-a-days it is difficult to say who are Mandiill and 
who Garhiill, though feeling still runs high on the point. Further 
the Ghanidls are all regarded as standing high, since they onco held 
the rij, though some have now slender means, and they will not give 

* Tradition makes Chibh Chand's father, Njihar Chand, Raja of Kangra, a contemporary 
of Taimiir, but tho Chibhal (Jliibhal) was aheady known by that name to Taimiir's his- 
torian. 

I A variant says that the Chibhs are of Persian descent. Na'mdn, a descendant of Dirih, 
son of Rahman, ruled Khurasan, and his descendant, Gauhar Shah, came to the Deccan and 
married Nahir Chand's daughter and their son was named Ahdar Chand, a Hindu. Hi$ 
descendant N4hir Chand became Rnja of Kangra.

daughters to others. The Samwcilias, Midn^s and Malktlnas are also 
regarded as superior for uuknown reasons, and either intermarry or 
seek matches for their girls among the Sayyii^s or Gakkhars whom they 
admit to be their superiors. Lastly the Chibhs descended from Sh^di 
Kliitn havo 14 septs, mostly named after oponyms: — 

1 . Rupyd,], descended from Rup Khdn. 

2. Barwdna, from Baru Khd,n.

ChilIsi, an inhabitant of Childs, which is a canton comprising six valleys 

in the Indus Kohistan. Its inaccessibility has given the Chilasis a 

spirit of independence and a distinctive character among all the Kohistan 

''' y communities. 'J'hough but somewhat recent converts to Isldm they are 

) ' \- more fanatical' than any other Dard community, and being Sunnis, every 

V . J Sbia wKo falls into their hands is put to death, without the usual alter- 

l^ "^ native of slavery. Once subject to Gilgit, the Childsis were notorious 

for slave-raiding and they once repulsed a Sikh expedition from Kash- 
mir. In 1851 they were however subdued by that State and now give 
no trouble to its government. The love of music, dancing and polo, so 
general in the Indus Kohistdn, is unknown in Childs. Tradition says 
that the whole of Shinkdri was once ruled by a Bindu rdjd, Chachai by 
name, from Chilas, which, on his death without issue, became divided 
into republics, as it is now. Later, a civil war between two brothers, 
Bot and Matchuk, ended in the expulsion of the latter's adherents, and 
the Bote are now the most prosperous family in the canton. Tradition 
also preserves the name of Naron, the old tutelary deity of Chilas. Each 
village is independent and has a number of elected elders, jushteros, 
but they are the servants, rather than leaders, of those whom they re- 
present. The elders are mostly occupied in the details of the village 
administration, but all matters are discussed in the sigas or public 
meeting, whose decision is announced by them. If several villages 
combine to hold a sigas, each appoints ajushtero, and after the general 
discussion, which is as open as that at a village sigas, a loud whistle is 
given, after which none but the representative jushteros are permitted 
to speak. The elders' decisions about land disputes are respected, 
but criminal justice is administered by the mullahs, who profess to 
follow the Muhammadan Law, but who are really guided by ancient 
custom, which is very stron^^f in some villages. Murder is rare and is 
generally regarded as a tort to be avenged by the nearest relation. 
The blood feud is however not allowed to continue indefinitely and 
after a time the parties are made to swear peace on the Quran,—

Chiliss — Chish ti. 1^1 

Chiliss, a group of some 200 families, so called by their neighbours, but 
styling themselves Galls, found scattered in the Kohi tract in the 
Indus Kohistdn. Originally, say their traditions, settled in Buncr, they 
migrated to Swat and tlionce to the Indus in vain attempts to escape 
conversion to Islam. They are looked up to by their neighbours and 
occupy, as a rule, the best land in the country. I'robably an ofl"- 
shoot of the Torwdlik, they doubtless derive their name from Chdhil,* 
the principal village in Torwal: Biddulph, Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh, 
pp. 10, 69. 

Chima.— One of the largest Jat tribes in the Punjdb. They say that some 
25 generations back their ancestor Chima, a Chauhan Rtijput, fled from 
Delhi after the defeat of llai Tanurat (Prithi Raj), by Muhammad of Ghor, 
first to Kangra in the Delhi District and then to Amritsar, where his 
son Chotu Mai founded a village on the Beds in tho time of Ala-ud-din. 
His grandson was called Rana Kang, and the youngest of his eight 
sons, Dhol (the name appears among the Hinjra), was tho ancestor of 
their present clans— Dogal, Mohtil, Nagara and Chima. Tho Chima 
have the peculiar marriage customs described under tho Siihi Jdts, and 
they are said to bo served by Jogis instead of Brahmans, but now-a-days 
Bhania purohits ai-o said to perform their ceremonies. They are a 
powerful and united tribe, but quarrelsome. They are said to marry 
within the tribe as well as with their neighbours. The bulk of the 
tribe embraced Isldm in the times of Firoz ShAh and Aurangzeb, but 
many retain their old customs. They are most numerous in Sialkot, 
but hold 42 villages in Gujranwala, and have spread both eastwards and 
westwards along the foot of tho hills. 

It is noteworthy that tho tribe takes its generic name from its young- 
est clan, and is descended from Dhol, a youngest son. 
Another genealogy is—

172 The ChisUi sect. 

from Asia Minor, settled at Chisht, a village in Khurasan and 
became the teacher of a large body of Musalmans.* One of his 
successors, Khwaja Muin-ud-din Chisliti, a native of Sanjar in Persia, 
migrated to India in the time of Ghias-ud-din Balban, settled in Ajmer 
and established the order in India. His khalifa or immediate successor 
was Khwdja Qutb-ud-din Bakhtiar Kaki, who is buried near the 
Qutb Minar at Delhi,t and his successor was the celebrated Bab^ 
Farid Shakarganj, whose shrine is at Pakpattan in Montgomery. The 
surname of this saint is said to be derived from the fact that, owing 
to the purity of his body, all he ate became sugar : if we may trust 
another story, he " nourished himself by holding to his stomach wooden 
cakes and fruits when he felt hungry. This miraculous but inexpensive 
provender is still preserved." An immense fair is held at his shrine 
each year, and the object of every piltrrira wlio attends is to get through 
th e narrow gate of the shrine on the afternoon or night of the 6th 
Muharram. The saint is adored by Hindus^ as well as Musalmans, 
and to be a disciple of Baba Farid does not necessarily imply being 
a Chishti ; and, again, the descendants of this saint and his relations, 
carnal or spiritual, have formed themselves into a separate caste of 
men who are found on the Sutlej in Montgomery and who, though 
bearing the name of Chishti, are now in all respects an ordinary 
lay caste, quite apart from the religious order of the same name. 

Baba Farid had two disciples : one of these was Ali Ahmad surnamed 
Sd,bir, whose shrine is at Pi ran Kaliar near Rurki, and whose followers 
are known as Sabir Chishtis ; the other was the celebrated and 
mysterious Niz^m-ud-din Aulia (1232-1324 a. d.), around whose tomb 
are collected some of the choicest monuments of ancient Delhi, and 
whose disciples are known as Nizdmis. 

The Chishtis in repeating the profession of faith lay a peculiar 
stress on the words Illalldhu, repeating these with great violence, and 
shaking at the same time their heads and the upper part of their 
bodies. The sect is said to be specially affected by Shias, and it is 
distinguisbed by its adoption of vocal music in its religious services. 
The members of the order are worked up by these religious songs 
to a high pitch of excitement, and often sink down exhausted. They 
frequently Wear coloured clothes, especially clothes dyed with ochre or 
with the bark of the acacia tree. Their principal shrines in the 
Punjab are the tomb of Nizam-ud-din Aulia at Delhi, Ihe hhdngdh 
of Miran Bhik in Ambala, the shrine of Baba Farid at Pakpattan, and 
the khdngdh of Hazrat Sulaim^n at Taunsa in Dera Ghazi Khan. 

In Bahawalpur the Chishti sect has in modern times shown great 
vitality. Shaikh Taj-ud-din Chishti was a gi'andson of Farid-ud-din 
Shakar-ganj and his descendants founded the village of Chishtian in 
that State. His shrine is also called Roza Taj Sarwar. Many tribes 
accepted Islam at his hands, especially the Sodlia and Rath, and this led 
to war with the Rajputs of Bikaner. The saint on going forth to battle 



* " The Cliishti or Chishtia is aa order of Muhammadan faqirs founded by Banda NawaZ 
\Vho is buried at Kalbargah." — Punjab Census Report, 1881, Section 518. 

f See the interesting account of this saint given in the late Mr. Carr Stephen's Archxology 
of Delhi, p. 1 7-t aeqq. He is the patron saint of the Afghans, 

X In Gurgaou the shrine of Shaikh Ahmad Chishti is mainly frequented by Eiadtis. 



The Chishti revival. 173 

pitched a flag on top of liis liouso and told his womun-folk that as long as 
the flag stood thoy would know he was safe. Unfortunately the flag 
was accidentally knocked down and the women prayed for the earth to 
swallow them up as the saint had commanded. Their prayer was grant- 
ed and they were engulfed, only the edges of their shawls remaining 
outside. A tower was built on the spot and at it women still make vows. 
One of the women, however, a Bhatti by tribe, did not join in the prayer 
and was not engulfed, but made her escape. Hence the Chishtis do not 
marry Bhatti women to this day. Near this shrine, at the tomb of 
Khw:S,ja Nur Muhammad, stood five largo jand trees, called rmijau 
Pirdn de jand, or the jand trees of the five pirs. Under their shade 
Bdiwa N^uak once sat and prophesied that ho who should obtain 
possession of it would indeed bo blessed, for it was a part of paradise. 
Muhammadans hero sacrifice goats and sheop after offering prayers for 
rain. Hindus offer a covering of chintz for the restoration of health, 
and sugar and boiled grain for rain. 

The Chishti revival. — The decay of the movement headed by Bawa 
Farld Shakar-ganj had become marked, when Khwjtja Nur Muhammad 
Qibla-i-Alim, a Punwar Riljput of the Kharral tribe, revived it. This 
saint was a disciple of Maulana Fakhr-ud-din, Muhib-ul-Nabi, of Delhi. 
He had miraculous powers and once saved the sinking sliip of ono 
of his disciples,* his spirit being able to leave his body at will. ' Ho 
had promised another disciple to pray for him at his death, 
and though he pre-deceased him, re-appeared in the flesh and fulfilled 
the promise. It would seem that in a sense the rise of the Chishti 
sect marks an indigenous revival of Isldm, under religious leaders 
of local tribes, instead of the older Sayyid families. Thus the Baloch 
tribes on the Indus are often followers of the Chishti saints, but 
even the Sayyids of both branches recognize their authority. 

The four chief khalifas of Qibld,-i-Alim were, Nur Muhammad II, of 
Hcljipur or Narowala, in tahsil Rajanpur, Qiizi Muhammad Aqil, of 
Chd,chanin Sharif, Hafiz Muhammad Jamal, Multiini, and Kliwiija 
Muhannnad Sulaiman Khan, of Taunsa Sharif, in tahsil Sanghai*. Klialiia 
Muhammad Aqil was a Qoraishi and one of his descendants. Shaikh 
Muhammad Kora, founded the religious tribe of that name. Muhammad 
Aqil's shrine was at Kot Mitlian, but, when Ranjit Singh confjuorcd the 
Deraj^t, Khwaja Khuda Bakbsh, Malibub Ilahi, his descendant, settled 
at Chacharan Sharif, which may now bo regarded as the head- quarter of 
the Bahawal])ur State religion. Muhammad A{|il displayed many 
mu'acles and in his old ago, owing to his spiritual enlightenment, had no 
shadow ; so he used to come out of his house on dark nights only, in order 
to conceal his sanctity. A cloth [luugi) which passed through liis body is 
kept as a relic to this day. One of his khalifas was Maulvi Sultan Mahmud 
whose shrine is at Khan Bcla. This saint was fond of misai, a kind of 
bread, of fowls and of snuff, in his lifetime; so these are offered 
at his shrine — a clear instance of anthrojDolatry — very similar are 
the offerings made to Birs. The Siifis, or devotees of the Chishtia 
sect, have a number of songs [kdfiK) which they consider the i'ood of 
the soul. Their principal poets aro Budha Shah, Ghulam Slijih, a

followers of tlio sajjiida-nashins of Chacharftn are distinguished by a 
special head-dress, the Chd-chanin-Wclla top, or hat, which is shaped 
like a mosque and is about 15 inches high, covering the ears and 
neck. 

As a caste the Chishtis appear to be absorbing the Naqshbandis, many 
ot the Qadrias and other Sufi sects, especially in the south-east Punid,b.

first-named are divided into some 23 clans including the Katoe, the 
family of the Mihtar of Chitral, whence it is also called Mihtari. The 
other Adamzada clans are — 

Khushwakte.fi 
Raza, 

Muhammad Bege. 
Sangale. 
Kushamade. 
Khaniye. 
Burushe. 
Zundre or Ronos. 

From the Rono§ families the wazirs are generally, but not always, 
chosen. The Ronos are most numerous in Yassin, Mastuj and Chitrd,l, 
and are found, though in decreasing numbers, as one goes eastward, in 
Nilgar, Gilgit, Punyal, etc. In Nagar and Yassin they call themselves 
Hara or Haraiyo, in Wakhdn and Sarikul Khaibar-Khatar, and in Shigh- 
nan Gaibalik-Khatar. Wherever found they are held in great respect. 
Three principal traditions as to their origin exist, (1) that they descend- 
ed from Zun, Rono and Harai, the three sons of Sumalik who ruled in 
Mastuj before the Shdhrei dynasty of the Shins was established ; (2) that 
they are of Arab descent, from Muhammad Hanif a, son of Ali ; and 
(3) that they came from the ancient principality of Rajauri, near Punch, 
and are descended from three brothers, Sirang, Surung and Khangar 
Phututo. In appearance generally taller than the other inhabitants of 
ChitrAl, with rather high cheek-bones, oval faces not thickly bearded, an.d 
fairly developed features, some of them resemble high-class Rajputs in 
type. They give daughters to the ruling families, and the children of

* Chitral, Chitrar or Chitlar, as it is also called, will be found described in the Imperial 
Gazetteer. 

•f The Khushwakt6 were rulers of Mastiaj and conquered Yassin. Descendants of the 
Kfttore and Khushwakte families are alike called Mihtarjao or Mihtarbak, i,e. sons of 
Mihtars. 

X Called collectively Shah Sangale : descended from the common ancestor and founder 
of the Katorl and Khushwaktd families. 

§ Rono appears to be unquestionably the same word as Rand, the change from d to o 
being very common. Philological speculation might suggest the following equivalents: 
Sumalik = Siwalik ; Zun = Jun, the aborigines of Si^lkot ; Khalar = Kshatriya, Khattri, 
or Khattar (iu Bawalpindi).

such marriages can succeed to all the honours of the father's family. They 
all give daughters to Sayyids, and tlio Zundro of Chitrill do not refuse 
fchoni to the Pathdns of Dir. In their turn, however, they take wives 
from both Shins and Yeshkuns, and the children of such wives rank 
as Ronos and, if daughters, can marry into vuling families. Occasioiially 
Rono women are given to Shins and Yeshkuns, but this is a penalty for 
misconduct when they cannot find husbands in their own class. Kulino- 
families give daughters born of slaves or concubines to Konos, but not 
those born of lawful wives.* 

The Arbclbzddas and Faqir-Miskin are really one and the same, but 
the latter are the very poor class, some having barely sufficient to live on. 
The Kho, who inhabit the whole of Kashkar K4la, the Lut-kho and 
Arkari valleys and the mam valley down to Drosh, are by class Faqir- 
Miskin. They call the country Kho also, and divide it into Turi-klio 
(Upper), Mul-kho (Lower) and Lut-kho (Great). Tliey speak Kho- war, 
and are divided into classes such as the Toriye, Shire, Darkhane and 
Shohane, but have no caste distinctions. The Yidghal are also classed 
as Faqir-Miskins, as are the Kalash and Bashgali Kafirs, Danoariks, 
Gabr, and Siilh Posh — all broken tribes subject to Chitral. 

The Arbdbzddas are really well-to-do Faqir-Miskin who have been 
rewarded for services to the Mihtar. Coolies and ponies are furnished 
for his service by both these classes, the Adamzddas being exempt, and 
this corvee falls very heavily on them. 

The Ashima-dek (or more correctly Hashmat-diak), according to 
Biddulph. is a large class, ranking below the Zundre and comprising 
the following clans : — 



Atam Be^6. 
Bairani Begd. 
Baiyeke. 
Barshintak. 



Daslimann6. 
Jikan6. 

Kashe, of Kaab, in Baclakhsban. 

Koshial Beg6. 



Zadimd. 

Sha-ukd. 

Shighnie (of Shighnan). 



The term Hashmat-diakf signiifies food-giver, and this class is bound to 
supply the Mihtar and his retainers with 8 sheep and as many kharwdrs 
of wheat from each house whenever he passes through their villao-cs 
but it pays no other revenue. 

In the valley below Chitral, scattered among the villages, a number of 
the meaner castes are found, as in the Gilgit and Indus valleys. They are 
called Ustilds or "artificers" and include Dartocho (carpenters), Daro-ere 
(wooden bowl makers), Kulale (potters), Doms (musicians), and Mochis 
(blacksmiths j. The two latter rank below the rest and (»nly intermarry 
among themselves. The other three intermarry without restriction 
inter se, and occasionally give daughters to the Faqir-Miskin class. 
Ustilds are not found in Kdshkdr Bdla or Lut-kho. 

The physical characteristics of the Chitrjllis vary little. In appearance 
the men are light, active figures from 5' 5'' to 5' 8" in heio-ht. Thouo-h 
well made they are not, as a rule, remarkable for muscular development

presenting in this respect a marked contraCst to the Tartar races, and, 
despite their hardy, simple lives, they soom unequal to any prolonged 
physical elTorl. Tlioir constitutions also lack stamina and Ihey succumb 
easily to disease or change of climate. This want ot physique is 
strongly marked in the Shins. In disposition tractable, good-tempered, 
fond of merry-making, the Chitrdlis are neither cruel nor quarrelsome 
and readily submit to authority, though the Arbdbzdda class compares 
unfavouralDly with the older tribes, having been guilty of cruelties in war. 

The women are pleasing-looking when young, but not particularly 
handsome. The Khos of Faqir-Miskin status, however, are Indo-Aryans 
of a high typo, not unliko the Shins of the Indus about Koli, but better 
looking, having oval faces and finely- cut features, which would compare 
favourably with the highest types of beauty in Europe. Their most 
striking feature is tbeir large, beautifift eyes which remind one of 
English gypsies, with whom they share tho reputation of being expert 
thieves. They are also proud of their unusually fine hair. The Chitral 
. women used to be in gi-eat demand in the slave markets of K^bul, 
Peshdwar and Badakhshdn. The fairest complexions are to be seen 
among the Burish of Yassin and Hunza where individuals may be found 
who might pass for Europeans, and red hair is not uncommon. 

In Chitrc41, as in some of the valleys to the westward, many customs 
have in part disappeared under the influence of IsMm. 

The usual dress in Chitrdl, as in Yassin, Hunza, Nagar, Sirikot, 
Wdkhdn, etc., is a loose woollen robe, for which those who can afford it 
substitute cotton in summer. This is of the same cut as the woollen 
robe, but has quilted edges, worked round the neck and front with silk 
embroidery. When first put on the sleeves, which are very full, are 
crimped in minute folds, right up to the neck, giving the wearer 
a clerical appearance. Boots of soft leather are also worn. As in 
WAkhdn and Sirikot the men wear small, scanty turbans, not the 
rolled cap of Gilgit and Astor. The women wear wide trousers, over 
which is a loose chemise of coarse-coloured cotton stuff, fastening in the 
middle at the throat, and coming down to the knees. The opening is 
held together by a circular buckle, from which hangs a curious 
triangular silver ornament called peshawez, that varies in size 
according to the circumstances of the wearer. Round the neck are 
generally one or two necklaces of silver beads with oval silver medallions, 
and a piece of carnelian or turquoise set in them. Tliey also wear a 
loose woollen cap, generally of dark colour such as brown; but this 
kind of cap is now confined to women of the lower classes residing in 
the upper valleys^ and Chitral i women of the better classes wear 
embroidered silk caps. In the Shin caste unmarried women are 
distinguished by a white cap, which is never worn by married Shin 
women. 

Both men and women wear numbers of charms, sewn in bright- 
coloured silk, and suspended from the cap or dress by small circular 
brass buckles. Some of the buckles are veiy tastefully worked. A 
curious kind of cloth is sometimes woven out of bird's down. That of 
wild fowl and of the great viilture (G. himalayensis) is most generally 
used. The down is twisted into coarse thread, which is then woven like 
ordinary cloth. Robes made of it are very warm, but always have a

fluffy uncomfox'tablc look, suggcstivo of dirt. They arc only made in the 
houses of those in good uircuujstances. The iia^hm of the ibex is also 
in great demand lor wai'm clothing, but it never seems to lose its strono- 
goaty smell. 

When young the men shave the whole top of the head from tlie fore- 
head to the nape of the nock, the hair on botli sides being allowed to 
grow long and gathered into a single large curl on each side of the 
neck. The beard is kept shorn.* Youths of the better class only shave 
the top of the head for a breadth of two inches in Iront, tapering to half 
an inch behind. Those who cannot boast long locks dress their hair 
into numerous small cork-screw ringlets all round the head — an ancient 
Persian fashion.t On the ajjproach of middle ago the whole head ia 
shaved in orthodox Muhammadan fashion and the beard allowed to grow. 
The effect of the long-flowing locks reaching to the waist is often ex- 
tremely picturesque. 

The mode of salutation between equals, on meeting after a prolonged 
absence, is graceful and pleasing. After clasping each other, first on one 
side and then on the other, hands are joined and each kisses the other's 
hand in turn. When the meeting is between two of unequal rank the 
inferior kisses the hand ot the superior and he in return kisses the for- 
mer on the cheek — in the anciout Pei'sian fashion. J 

In Chitral and Yassin, as in Shighnan, Badakhshan, VVakhdn, Gilgit 
and Hunza§ a chief's visit to a chief is celebrated by the kubah, an 
observance thus described Ijy Biddulpli : — "On arrival, the visitor is con- 
ducted to the Sliawaran,!! and the followers of both chiefs show their 
dexterity in firing at a mark set up on a tall pole, from horseback, while 
galloping at speed. After this a bullock is led out before the guest, 
who draws his sword and does his best to cut its head off at a single 
blow, or deputes one of his followers to do so, and the carcase is given 
to his retinue." 

In tho Khowar tongue the term " uncle" is applied to the brothers of 
both father and mother without distinction : but aunts on tho mother's 
side are styled " mother " which may point to polygamy as the ancient 
custom of the Khos.^ Marriage of a widow with the husband's brother 
is common, though not compulsory. 

Cases of uifidelity are extremely common, and the men show more of 
the jealousy of their wives usual in older Muhammadan communities. 
In case of adultery the injured husband has the right to slay the 
guilty couple when he finds them together, but should ho slay the one 
and not tho other he is held guilty of murder."^* When conclusive 
proof is wanting in a trial before the icazir, guarantee is taken for the

future by the accused [)laciiijjf his lips to the woman's breast, and so 
sacred is the tic nf fosterage thus created that it has never been known 
to be broken. The husband has howover a right to both their lives.'^ 

The custom ol: fosterage is maintained among all the ruling families 
of the states of tlie Hindu Kiish and its ties seem stronger than those of 
blood kinshi}). When a child is born it is assigned to a foster-mother 
and brought u]) in her house, so that f rec|uently the father does not see it 
till it is six or seven years old.t The fortunes ol' the foster-mother's family 
are unalterably bound up with those of the child and should exile be 
his lot they accompany him. On the other hand if he rises to influence 
his foster-father is generally his confidential adviser and his foster- 
brothers are employed on the most important missions. 

Friendship too is commonly cemented by the milk tie. If a woman 
dreams that she has adopted any one, or a man dreams that he has 
been adopted by any woman, the tie is created in the manner, 
already dpscribed as in vogue to make the woman tahu to the man. 
Not many years ago this custom was very common, though it is falling 
into disuse.J A young couple at marriage sometimes induce a friend 
to become their foster-father, and the tie is ratified when they eat 
together : both being seated opposite each other, the foster-father, 
seated between them, takes a piece of bread in each hand and 
crossing his arms puts the bread into their mouths, taking care 
to keep his right hand uppermost. Marriage between foster-kindred 
is regarded as incestuous. Among the Hashmat-diak the tie of fosterage 
is formed in a peculiar way, for in order to strengthen tribal unity it is 
customary for every infant to be suckled in turn by every nursing mother 
of the clan. In consequence there is a constant interchange of children 
going on among the mothers. 

Polo is the national game and is called ghcil in Chitriil where 
it is played in a special way. Shooting from horse-back at a gourd 
filled with ashes, or at a small ball, hung from a pole 30 feet high, 
is also pi*acti:3ed. Dancing is the national amusement, several different 
steps being in vogue, each with its special air. Almost all these 
commence slowly, increasing in pace till the performer is bounding 
round the circle at top speed. In Chitnll and Yassin the Hashmat-diak 
affect to despise dancing, but the mlers keep dancing-boys for 
their amusement. Singing is common and the Khowar songs, which 
are mostly amatory in character, show a more cultivated taste than 
those in the Shina tongue, the music of the language and the better 
rhythm of the verse entitling them to the first place in Dard poetry.§ 

The Chitrdlis are noted for their swordsmanship, which has gained 
many a victoi'y over matchlocks. 



* But if he does not kill them and intends to divorce his wife, or if his wife or daughter 
has been enticed away by some one, he can take as compensation some or all of the

while turning his back towards tbe assembly, as by turning his back he signifies his accept- 
ance of compensation,

5. Boi (sparrows). 12. Chhauchori (loaf-falling).

growing corn). 

The Muhammadan calendar is, however, coming into use, especially 
among the Uashinat-diak class. The Muhammadan days of the week 
are used, but Friday is called Adinna. 

In Chitrd,! the new year festival is called Dashti. It corresponds 
to the Nost of Yasin, Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Ponyal, Astor and Gor, 
but no bonfires are lit as in those territories. J 

At the commencement of the wheat harvest the Phindik,§ as it is 
called in Chitral, is observed. Tlie day having boon fixed with reference 
to the state of the crop, the last hour of daylight for the precedino- 
ten diiys is spent in dancing on the f<liawaran. At dusk on the evening 
before the festival, a mcmbci- of every household gathers a handful 
of ears of corn. This is supposed to be done secretly. A few of 
the ears arc hung over the door of the house, and the rest are roasted 
next morning and eaten steeped in milk, 'l^he day is ]->assed in the 
usual rejoicings, and on the following day harvest operations are com- 
menced. As some crops are always more forward than others, and 
ready to bo reaped before the appointed day, no restriction is placed 
on their being cut ; but to oat of the grain before the festival would 
provoke ill-luck and misfortune. 

Next comes the Jastandikitik || or " devihdriving " which celebrates 
the completion of the harvest. When the last cro]) of the autumn 
has been gathered, it is nt-cessary to drive away evil sjnrits from 
the granaries. A kind of porridge called mul is eaten, and 
the head of the household takes his matchlock and fires it iuto 
the floor. Then, going outside, he sets to work loading and firing 
till his powder-horn is exhausted, all his neighbours being similarly 
employed. Tho next day is spent" in the usual rejoicings, part of 
which consists in firing at a sheep's head set up as a mark. 

A festival called Binisik, " seed-sowing " — somewhat similar to the 
Chilli of Gilgit and the Thumor Piopan or "the Tliam's sowing" of 
Hunza and Nt'igar — takes place in Chitr.i.1 ; but the present ruling

done by drying them in a i)articular way, so that they remain lit for food for several 
months. This is necessary because the pastures have become covered with snow and 
only sufficient fodder is stored to keep a few animals alive through the winter.

there called.

class having novor identified themselves with their humbler subjects, 
the ruler takes no part in it.'^ The following account of the Chilli 
festival in Gilgit is contributed by Maulavi Ghulam Muhammad, author 
of The Festivals and Folklore of Gilgit : — 

" At night a big goat called asirkhan ai mugar (the goat of the kitchen) 
was killed at the R^'s house and a feast prepared by cooking about a 
maund of rice and two of flour. The baking of the bread was com- 
menced by an unmarried girl, on whom a gift [khillat] of a chddar (head 
cover) of longcloth was bestowed, but the other women took up her 
task. In former times a big loaf, called hi ai tiki (the loaf of seed), of 
a maund of flour, was also cooked on a fire made of straw, and distri- 
buted, half to a man of the Katchalat family, a fourth to the yarfa 
(the Rajfis grain collector), and a fourth to the Rdjd-'s ploughmen. But 
on this occasion three loaves (two of 20 sers each and one of ten sers) 
were prepared. The big loaf was about seven feet in circumference 
and four inches thick. One of them, with 24 sers of flour, wasgiveu to 
the Katchata in the morning, and the other two were divided equally 
between the yarfa and the ploughmen in the afternoon. The local 
band played all through the night with dancing and singing. At 
10 in the morning the people of Gilgit, Barmas, etc., assembled at 
the R^'s house where a durhar was observed, i-e., some ghi, chilli leaves 
and seeds of the wild rue were placed on an iron pan, beneath which 
a little fire was made in order to fumigate the air with its smoke. 
The bandsmen and the man who had brought the load of chilli 
branches from the jungle, were then each given a khillat of a muslin 
turban. A khillat of ti turban and a choga (cloak) was also given to 
Ghulam, one of the Katchata family, whose face was then rubbed 
with flour, a small loaf of bread mixed with ghi being given him to 
eat. According to custom while eating this he ought to have bellowed 
like an ox, but this I'ite was not observed. A maund of wheat was also 
put in a leather bag. The procession was ready to proceed to the 
Rd's field by about 11-30. The bag of grain was loaded on the 
Katchata, one man took the iron pan used in the Duban, and another 
took the two big loaves, the one uppermost being covered with about 
four sers of butter with a pomegranate placed in the middle, while two 
chilli branches were stuck in the butter r-ound the pomegranate. Two 
men carried a he- and a she-croat, while the remainder of the procession 
had branches of c/tiZZi in their hands; and the procession, with the band 
playing in front, started for the Rd,'s field whei e the sowing was to be 
commenced. 

* In Yasin this festival is accompanied by a curious custom. The charvelu is mounted 
on a good liorse aod clad in a robe of honour given him by the Mihtar. In this way 
he is conducted to the polo ground, where all seat themselves while the music strikes 
up, and the tnrangfah gallops twice up and down the ground. Should any accident happen 
to him, such as either himself or his horse falling, it is regarded as a presage of mis- 
fortune to the whole community, and of speedy death to himself. In order to avert exil, 
he and his family observe the day as a solemn fast. 

+ A family of Gilgit, which in ancient times became such a source of danger to the chief 
of Gilgit, that it was attacked and massacred to a man, only a pregnant woman managing to 
escape towards Darel. After this the crops of Gilgit did not flourish for several years, and 
a damjdl (soothsayer) said that its fertility depended on the Katchata family, and that until 
a man of that clan was brought there to commence the seed-sowing the crops would never 
flourish. After a great search the son of the woman who had escaped towards Darel was 
fouiid and brought to Gilgit. On his return the crops gave a gocd outturn.

The Katchata then took from a leather baj^ one affor the other 4 
handfiils of wlieat, in eacli of wliich he rnixod a wa.s7ia of gold-dust., 
and o-avo them to Kajii Ali Dad Khdu, wlio throw the first handful 
towards tho west, the second towards the east, tho third to tho 
north and the fourth to the soutii. Then the Rti himself ploughed 
three turns in his field with a pair of bullocks which were ready on tho 
spot. The ivazir of Gilgit ought then to have ploughed three turns but 
this was omitted. The band then commenced pLaying and two grey- 
beards of good family, with swords and shields in their hands, jumped 
forward and began to dance amid joyous cheers from the people. This 
dance is called achhush meaning ' prestige^ or ' pomp,' and is intended 
to awaken the deity of prestige Meanwhile a hc-go;it was, accordino* 
to custom, killed by a man of a Rono family. This goat is called 
acWiush ai mugar, i.e., ' tho goat of the deity of pomp ' and is sacrificed 
in his honour. Its head and two of its foft were separated and two 
men, one with the head and thn other with the two feet in their hands, 
came forward and danced amid the rejoicings of the people. All tho 
flesh of tho goat was, as is customary, given to the people of Barmas 
village to prepare a feast. A she-goat, called the yadeni ai ayi, i.e., 
' the goat of tho deity of drums,' was then killed and given to tho bands- 
meu. The procession then started back to the Rajii's house where the 
feast cooked at night was served. The Rdju had to give some bread 
to tho niotabars and the bandsmen from his own dish. This custom 
is called ishjnn ; after that tho people started for the shawaran (])olo 
ground) to play polo and make merry. After polo the people no-ain 
went to the Rji'a house and dined there- Tho Katchata commenced 
ploughing his fields the same day, while the other zamhuldrs did not 
commence work on their fields till the next day."*

* Tho corresponding Thomil festival of Piniidl is thus describod by the Maulavi : 

" A very intereatin,!!; ceremony known as tlie Thomil used to bo observed every year at 
Sher Killa, tho seal of tho Ilaja of Piuu;U, before seed-sowiiii;. On tlio day it was to be 
observed, the people visited tlic liajii in his Fort and t^ot from him 10 or 2u scrs of Hour, 4 
or G scrs of ghi and one big goat. Tim Hour was mado into broad thin leaves on which 
the ghi was placed. Tho preliminaries were observed in the Fort. All the persons present 
held in their hands a small branch of tho holy juniper tree, aad thoso possessing oims 
brought their weapons Avith them. From the gate of the Fort, tho Raja attended by^ his 
people marcliofl out to (he open Holds among tlieir shouts and cries, a band playini? various 
war-tunes. The assembly then gatliered in an ojien Held, and tho cooked leaves were 
presented to the Rija who tasted one of them. The rest was then distributed amonc all 
present. After tho feast prayer was madn for an abundant crop. Tho goat was then 
killed, and leaving the carcase boliind, its iiend was brought before the assembly and 
being greased with butter, lloiu- was spriidded on it from tho forehead down to the nose. 
Tho head was then placed at some distance as a tar<;et to be lired at. Tho firing was opened 
by the Raj^ who was followed by his vwtahar.^ and any other who possessed fire-arms. 
WHiosoever hit tho head was liable to contribute a chalar of country wino. When this 
target practice was over, the assembly dispersed after a nnti dance, which was civcn by a 
motuhcir of th« Raja, who used to prcs.mt him with a turban. In the evening the goat's 
flesh was roasted and enjoyed with tho wino contributed by thos(> who had hit'lts head io 
tho day. Only the people of Sher Killa had the right to share in this merry-making, no 
one else from other villages of Punial being even allowed to attend it. A few years ago 
this ceremony was discontinued, but it was revived this year (I'JIO)."

After the wedding a girl seldom revisits her parents' home, and if 
in consequence of a quarrel with her husband's people she does do 
Fo, and dies in her paternal home, her parents are bound to find 
another bride for her husband in her stead. Fornication in this sept 
is punished with excommunication and re-admission to the caste only 
permitted on payment of a fine, but even that does not remove the stigma. 

Chuhra. — The sweeper or scavenger, and hence the out-caste, par excellence, 
of the Punjab, whose name is popularly supposed to be a corruption 
of Sudra."^ It has many synonyms, but few of them are precisely 
the exact equivalent of Chuhr^. Thus a Chamdr is, probably by 
origin, a Chuhra who works in leather, but the Chamars appear to 
form almost a distinct caste, though both the castes are placed in the 
same rank and lumped together in the popular phrase Chuhr^-Chamar, 
just as Mochi-Juhihd, is used to denote collectively the two castes 
which bear those names. As a scavenger or rather as a 'sweeper up 
of dusc ' the Chuhra is termed khdk-roh. As a domestic he is 
ironically t styled Mihtar or 'chieftain': as a worker in leather 
he is called a Dhed (lit. 'crow '), as a weaver he is styled Megh, 
at least in Sid,lkot, in which district the Meghs however form to all 
intents and purposes a tjeparate caste : and as an executioner he is 
known as Jallad. Further as a tanner the Chuhra is called a 
Khatik in the Eastern Punjab, and as a breeder of swine he is known 
as a Hiili. These two groups appear to form distinct castes, or at 
least sub-castes which rank below the Chuhrii, proper. The Khatiks 
have a sub-group called Basur. 

Chtinge of religion also involves the adoption of a new title and 
the Chuhra on conversion to Sikhisra becomes a Mazbi or Mazhabi, 



* Once Balmik, founder of the caste, arrived late at a feast given by a Bhagat and 
found only fragments of it left. These he devoured and earned the name of Chuhra or 
'one who eats leavings.' 

t But in Gurgaon mihtar is used as equivalent to chcntdhri and the term may be origin- 
ally free from any taint of irony.

while one who embraces Isli'im becomes a Musalli,* vr in the south-west 
of the Punjab a Kuitana,t or ho niuy ever aspire to be entitled iJindar : 
indeed in the villages ol" the i'aclihada KajpiitH of hsirsa the peu|ilo who 
remove filth are called Dindar-Kluikrob and they follow Muhaniniadan 
observance.-, being even admitted to tmoke with otlier Muliaimiiadans. 
Bhangi is also used, but not very correctly, as ii synonym for Cliuliia. 

The Chuhras' relations to other castes vary consideral)ly. They aro 
distinctly superior to the Sausis, from whom alone they will not eat 
in Niibha. 13ut in Gurgaon they are also said to look down upon the 
Changars or Dliias, who are makers of winnowing sieves, and they 
are said to refuse food from the Uhanak's hands too, thongli tJieir 
claim to superiority is a doubtful one. The Chuhras aro split up into 
various groups : 

Territorial. 



Deswali — of the Gangotic plain. 
B^ofi-i — of the Great Indian Desert. 



Sotarwala— of the rivei'ain lands. 
Janfflilke — of the JanLral tract. 



Various other divisions exist, being recognised by the Chuhras them- 
selves if not by others. Such are : — 

1. Bahniki. | 2. Ldl-Begi. 

These two are really identical, Lai Beg having been Balmik's disciple. 
Both terms aro thus equivalent to ' disciples of Balmik or Lai Beg.' 

The gots of the Chuhras are numerous and some are wide-spread. 
Various origins are claimed for them. Thus the Bohat, found in 
Gurgaon, claim to bo Punwar Rajputs, and the Sdrwdn, also of Gurgaon, 
to be Chauhans. There is also a Chauhd,u got, south of the Sutlej. 

In Rohtak the Lohat also claim to be descendants of one Sdnjhar 
Das, a Rd,jput, while the Baohar say they are Punwar Rdjputs from 
Dhciranagri in the Deccan and that their ancestors immigrated into 
that District with the Ktlyaths. These two gotii do not intermarry with 
Changars, and lay stress on the necessity for marrying a girl before 
she is L5 or 16. They regard Bdlmik as God's brother and revere him 
as their prophet with a Muhammadan ritual, reciting prayers (navidz) 
in a line headed by an imam, and prostrating themselves with the 
words : — Balmik hafi, Bdliaik slulfi, Balmik nm'dfi, holo momno icohi ck. 

The Pail-powar got, in Rohtak, also claims Rajput origin, saying 
that a Rdjput woman who was pregnant threw in her lot with the 
Chuhrds. Her son was called a Pail-powdr on account of her descent. 
This got reveres Guru Ndnak, docs not employ Brahmans, and gets its 
weddings solemnized by one of its own members. But it buries its dead. 

The original division, Dr. Youngson was informed, was into Lute, 
Jhae, and Tengre, the Lute being Manhd,s Rajput, wandering Dogras ; 
the Jhae, Dh^o or Sahi being named from their founder, who, when 
a child, slept beside a hedgehog [sch) ; and the Te'ngrc being makers 
of wionowing-sieves, living in the desert, and named Tengre on account 
of their pride. Besides the three original divisions, there are Goriyd, 
so called from the fact that their founder was born in a tomb {gor). 

* Musalli may bo defined as a Clmhi'a converted to Islam who has abandoned hardin 
food, eatinf^ only haldl. The Muaallia do not intermarry with the Chuhras, or at least 
only take dauj^hters from them. 

t Kurtaua or Kotaiui is said to be derived from Uindi kora, 'whip,' nixd tan n a 'to 
stretch,' and thus to mean ' flogger,' because swuepora wero employed aa executioners by 
Muhammadan rulers. 



184 Chuhrd genealogy. 

They bail from Delhi. TIio founder was Slmli Jahan^s son. He was 
also called Kandara, because lie spoke harshly.* 

Next come : Pal.han, originally from Kdbul, in Akbar's time. There 
were three brothers, of wh«m phagana was the eldest. They entered 
the country as /agiri', or ji5ir5. Gil; from Chakrari in Gujrd,nwdld,. A 
tree sheltered the iirst of the name in a time of rain: and in Dera 
Ghazi Khan tlie section respects bricks. Bhatti ; from the Bar in 
Gujrauwala, Findl Bhattian, Dulla being their chief. Sahotre; in 
Akbar's time Sahotra was thrown to the tigers, but the tigers did not 
injure him. In Dera Gha:,ii Khan the Sahotra section respects the 
lion. iSoeni Bliunniar ; descendants of Raja Karn, the Brahman, who 
gave away Ij maunda of gold every day before he ate his food. 

Then follow Laddar; Khokar, who are said to avoid eating the heart 
of a dead animal in Montgomery, while in Dera Ghd,zi Khdn they do not 
eat hharta or things roasted on the fire ; Khonje, Kaliane, Ratti, Mathi, 
Burt, Mome (in ildqa Moma near Gondhal). The Momi are said to be 
descended from Biilmik, Hauns, Chapriban (in Khak beyond Lahore, 
makers of wicker-work), Ghussur, Balhim, Labante, Nahir. 

The Dum, the Chulira, the Mirasi, the Machchi, the Jliiwar, and the 
Changar, are all of the same origin. They claim to be indigenous in the 
Sialkot District, at least as far as the older divisions are concerned. 

In the time of the Pandavas and Kauravas there were four sons of 
Kanwar Brahma, viz., Puraba, Partha^ Siddhra, and Prashta, the last 
being also called Jhaumpra, from living in a jungle. There are other 
names applied to him and to his successors, such as Ghungur Beg, AU 
Maluk, Lai Beg, Pir Chhota, Balmik, Bala. The following genealogical 
tree was given, but I presume it is a voiy uncertain one : —

* Another version (Ironi Moutgomcry) is that Jhata, Jhaba, Tiugri, and Athwal were 
four brotliera, probably Muharamadans. Of these Jhata became a follower of Baba Farid, 
and his descendants, called Jhatas, continued to observe the Muhammadan law (i.e., did 
not become Chuhras). Jhaba's and Tingra's descendants worked as Chuhras, and are 
kuownasJhais (Chais') and TIngras, respectively. Of Athwal's progeny some remained 
Muhammadans, while others became Chuhras and are now known as Athwal Chnhraa. 

The Jhaba (Jhai or Chai) section is closely associated with Multan, When that city 
was founded, tradition asserts that the king commenced to build a fort which collapsed 
as fast as it was built. The spot was held by the Jhaba Bhangis, one of whom offered 
himself as the fort's foundation-stone, and is said to be still standing in the Khani Burj 
of the Fort. Some people regard this hiirj as a place of pilgrimage. The Jhai — possibly 
owinfT merely to his fortunate name — was sacrificed to ensure victory in battle — Jhaye 
sandhi faich ^vandi, which is explained to mean, if a living Chuhra be built into a thick 
wall of burnt brick before going to war, victory is assured. 

In Tarn Taran tahsil, Amritsar District, Brahma's son, Chuhra, had three sons. Lata, 
Jhaba, and a ^iclMag named Tingru, from whom are dttscynded the 2| original eectioni of 
the caste.

Another version is that Bh^rthd, Sadhara, Paratnd and Purba were 
four Brahman brothers, and when their cow died they made Purba, the 
youngest, drag away the carcase, first promif<ing to help him in his task, 
but eventually out-casting him for doing it. In Dera Ghdzi Khan 
Urga, Bh^rga, Sidhra and Frastd, also called Chhaumpra, are given as 
the four brothers, and the following verses are current : — 

(«) Alldh chitthi ghalli hai, sab khol bidn, God sent a letter, setting forth all things : 

Ithe gid manke hun, kiun karin ahhmdn ? ' Hereunto you submitted, why do you repine 

Qokhri te aike sabi kardi arydn. The cow was cast out by one of you, why then 

do you plead, 
Aadn Brahman janam di gal jamd tanydn. That "we are Brahmans by birth," ye who 

wear the jdmd\ tied with strings.' 

The last couplet is also given thus : — 

Odkhri uU daki kardi arydn, ' They are all arguing over the COw : — 

Aidn Brahman janam de gal jdme tanydn. (Saying) " We are Brahmans by birth, thongh 

we wear the jdmd fastened with tags." ' 

Further these two verses are sometimes added : — 

Ute charkhane doreli larydn, Wearing too the chicken cloth, 

Rabbd ! Sdde bha di galldnmushkil banian, Lord ! ' We are in great distress.'

fate.' 

Origins. 
Various legends have been invented to explain the origins of the 
Chuhra caste as a whole and of its different groups. Most of these 
carry its history back to Bdlmik as its progenitor, or, at least, its patron 
saint. Hence it is necessary to recount, in the first instancs, what 
current tradition has to say of Balmik. 

One legend avers that Bd,lmik used to sweep Bhagwan's courtyard, 
and that the god gave him a robe, which he did not put on but buried 
in a pit. When asked by Bhagwan why he did not wear it, Balmik 
went in search of it and found in it a boy whom he took to Bhagwan. 
The god directed him to rear the boy, who was named Ld;l Beg. 

Balmik is said to mean, ' born of the halni' or serpent's hole. 
Balmik was a Bhil, a race of mountaineers, who used to rob and kill 
travellers passing through the forest. One day seven Rishis journeyed 
by, and when Balmik attacked them, they asked him why he did so, as 
they had nothing worth stealing. He replied that he had vowed to kill 
all whom he found in the forest. 'J'he Rishis thpn enquired if he had 
friends to assist him if captured. Whereupon he asked his parents 
and wife if tJiey would help him in case of need, but they declared they 
would not. Balmik then told the Rishis he was friendless, and they 
urged him to give up his evil ways, and to repeat ' mard, mard,' 
continuously. But rapidly recited ' mard , mard' soumis like ^Ram, 
Kdm,' and as he thus repeated (jod's name, his sins were forgiven him. 
By the end of 12 years his body was covered with dust and overgrown 
with grass, the flesh beingr decomposed. Once more the seven Rishis 
passed by and heard a faint voice repeating ' Ram, Rom,' under a cover- 
ing of clay. This they removed, and, having re-clothed his bones with 
flesh, called hiru Balmik, as one who had come out of a serpent's hole. 

1. Tabds and Totems. 
The Gil will not eat hatdun, the egg-plant (hhatd hart) : the Lute do 
not eat hare or rabbit : the Kanar^ (?) abstain from cloves : the Sahotr^ 
refuse to look on a tiger ; at marriages, however, they make the image 



Chuhri panchfiyats. 189 

of a tiger which the women worship : the Bhat^i will not bit on a bench 
of boards or bricks : no Chuhrii will cat seh, or hef^gehog. 

The Sarwan Chuhras do not dye cloth with hasumha, eallron, and 
will only use thatch for their roofs. In the Bawal nizdmat of Ndbha 
they also wear no gold ornaments, thinking this tahu to be imi)Osed 
on them by their ,sati. In Dera Ghazi Kh^m the different sections 
reveience diffocnt animals, i.e., the Sahoti respect the lion, the 
Athwal or Uthwdl the camel, and one section the porcupine, while bricks 
are said to be revei'ed by the Gil, men bowing and women veiling their 
faces before them. Thus the Sindhu muliin or got rtispects indigo : the 
Kandiara respects the horned rat ; while the Khokhar got is said to avoid 
eating hharta, ^.e., anything roasted on a fire.* Thu Khokhar got is 
also said to abstain from the flesh of dead wnimals as well as from 
eating the heart, which all other Chuhras will eat. 

The flesh of the hare is also avoided by Clmhras generally — a tahu 
explained by the following legend : — Once a Chulira by chance killed 
a culf, and hid it under a basket, but its owner tracked it to the 
Chuhra's liouse. 'i'he Chuhra declared that the basket contained a 
hare, and when it Avas opened it was found that the calf had turned 
into a hare — so from that time all the Chuhras have given up eating 
hate. iSome, however, do not abide by this rule. In Kiingra it is said 
that once a hare sought Biilmik's protection, and thus the tahu arose. 
In Montgomery the avoidance of hare's llesli is ascribed to the influence 
of the Makhdum Jahaniau of Kher fShcih, those who are not his 
followers disregarding the prohibition. Li Dera Ghazi Khdn the 
current legend is that once Billa Shah, the ancestor of the Chuhras, 
and MuUdh Niir, the Mirasi, were in God's dargah, or court. The 
latter asked Bald Shdh not to sweep, whereupon a quarrel arose and 
Bdla Shah struck the bard with his broom, knocking out his right eye. 
MulUh Nur appealed to God and produced a hare as his witness — so 
now the sweepers do not eat hare's flesh. In Gurgaon, however, the 
prohibition is said to be confined to the Sus Gohar got, or, according to 
another account, to the Balgher got. In Mdler Kotla it is confined to the 
Sahota got. About Leiah, women are said to eat the hare, but not nien» 

2. Governing Body. 

Their representative assembly, or governing body, is the Painch, 
Panch, Panchayat, the members of which are chosen by the people, 
and the head of which, i.e., the Pir Panch or Sar Panch, is selected 
by the other members. I have heard them speak of a kharjmuch too, 
I.e., the most troublesome n, ember of the paiich ! The office of the 
^n'r ^anc7i is held permanently, and is even in some cases hereditary. 
If the pir is unable to pieside at the meetings his place may be tak3n 
by a narharnh, or substitute, for the time being. The ^jaz/jc/i settles 
disputes of all sorts, havin<r to interfere especially in matters of mar- 
riage and divorce ; it also looks after the poor. It punishes offenders 
by excomnuinication, liukka panl hand, and also by imposing fines 
of 20, 40, 100 I'Uppes, or even more- Thf punishment of excommuni- 
cation, of being haradari so jiidd, is a heavy one, pointing to the fact 
that the people, valuing s-o highly the opinion of their fellow-mexi,

190 Chuhrd marriage rules. 

are amenable to tlio rules of their society by reason of sanctions 
affecting their standing in the society. All over the Punjab the 
dearest thhig to a Fanjdbi is his 'izzat, i.e., the estimation in which 
he is held by his fellows. In the south-east of the Province the 
Chuhras have chahiUras or places of assembly at several towns, such 
as Hiinsi, Hiss.tr, Barwdla, Sirsa and Bhiwani. Each chahutra is under 
a chaicdhri, who in Gurgaon is styled mihtar. The chaudhris preside 
over panchdyats at which all kinds of disputes are decided, and also act 
at weddings as muMiias or spokesmen. In Nabha the chaudhris are 
indeed said to exercise supreme authority in caste disputes. 
3. Kdles of Intermarriage. 

They do not marry within their own section, but they take wives 
from all the other divisions. Marriage with a wife's sister is permitted 
after the death of the wife. Marriage with the wife's mother, or wife's 
aunt, is not allowed- Two wives are allowed; the former of whom is 
considered the head, and has peculiar rights and privileges. The 
wives live together in the same house. Marriage takes place when 
the giii is about 7 or 8, and even 5 years of age. 

Marriages are arrauged by the ndi (barber), the chhimhd (washerman), 
and the mirdsi (village bard and genealogist). The consent of the 
parents is necessary in all cases, except when the woman is a widow, 
or independent of her parents. Girls are never asked whom they will 
uiiirry, or if they are willing to marry. They would not give an ex- 
pression of their wishes, as they say, sharm he mare, for shame. There 
is no freedom of choice in the case of young persons marrying. 

A price is paid by the bridegroom's family, the amount of it being 
settled by the two contracting parties. It becomes the bridegroom's 
property after marriage. An engagement to marry may be broken 
off in the case of a defect or bleQiish in either the man or the woman, 
and divorce may be obtained after marriage by a regular " writing: of 
divorcement." Divorced wives marry again. Children of different 
mothers inherit on equal terms, and all assume the father's section. 

Widows remarry, but they have no price. The widow of an elder 
brother may marry a younger brother, and the widow of a younger 
brother may marry an elder brother. A widow marrying out of her 
husband's family takes her children with her. 

4. Food. 

It is difficult to say precisely what animals the Chuhras really avoid, 
and probably the prohibitions against eating any particular animal are 
loose, varying from place to place and under the pressure of circum- 
stances. Chuhras in Gujrd;D will eat dead animals, i.e., those which 
have died a natural death :* also the sahna (lizard) and wild cat, but 
not the jackal, fi)X. goh (lizai'd), or tortoise: yet one group lives chiefly 
on the tortoise and is called huchemdnda. Hence the Chuhras are 
superior to the Sdnsfs who eat jackals, etc., and interior to the Musallis 
who have given up eating the flesh of animals which have died a natural 
death. In Si^lkot the Chuhrd,s are said to avoid pork and only to eat 
flesh allowable to Muhammadans, but they may eat hardm flesh as well 
as haldl. 

* Thus in Moutgomery it is said all Chuhras, except the Khokhars, will eat the flesh of 
dead animals 



Chuhrd observances. 191 

II.— DOMESTIC CEREMONIES. 

Birth and Peeq nancy. 

In accouchement the woman sits, with one woman on each side of her 
and one behind her. The ddi, or midwife, sits in front. No seat ia 
used. When the child is born the midwife places h'-r liead on the 
stomach of the mother to press out the blood, and with her feet and 
hands presses (dabdli) the whole body. The ddi and women relations 
attend during and after confinement. 

As an expression of joy at the birth of a child a string of shirin, or 
acacia leaves, is hunp; across the door. Green symholises joy and bless- 
ing, vnibdrikhddi. The leaves of the akh, a plant with poisonous milky 
juice, are thrown en the house to keep away evil spirits. If the child 
is a boy, born after two girls, they put the boy in a cloth, which they 
tie at both ends as a sort of cradle, and then they lift the child throuo-h 
the roof, while the nurse says : — Trihhal hi dhdr d-gai, i.e., ' the third 
time thrives.' Gtir is given to the friends, and ten days after that a 
dinner, to which the relatives are invited. At the end of 21 days the 
mother is over her separation, and resumes cooking. 

Adoption. 

Adoption of children is common, but with no special ceremonies. 

Initiation. 

A man of any other caste can be admitted into the Chuhra caste after 
the following initiatory rite has been performed : — The would-be convert 
asks the Chuhra headman of the place to fix a day, on which all the 
Chuhras assemble at the than of Bdlmik. At the time and dat" appointed 
the dhddhis of Balmik go there, prostrate themselves and sing praises 
to God and Bdlmik, with accompaniments on the rabdna and dotdra. 
Tho khidmatgdr, or attendant at the shrine, lights &jot, or large lamp 
filled with ghi and gogal at the candidate's cost, as well five ordinary 
lamps filled with ghi. He also prepares churmd of wheat or other 
grains according to the candidate's means, \vith ghi and gur in the 
name of God and Balraik ; boiling, too, IJ se?'6' of rice in an iron pan 
in the name of Balmik's orderly. When all these things are placed 
in front of the than in Dera Ghdzi, the Chuhras assembled say :— 

Sihdhe ! Bdli didn karin kardhidn, le dwin than de age, 

Jo koi mane tainu ndl sidaq de usnic har shdkhd phal lage, 

Awen dekh nahin bhuhid oh raze bage, 

Teri matti da buki manid dhar dargdh de age. 

Baki ute mnin dcvdn brdtdn jiwen banaydn din te rdtdn, 

Bolo momno ' eh sach paun dhani.' 

" Make hakva, Sihdhas (Chuhras) in Bd,li's honour, and bring it 

before his shrine. 

Whosoever adores thee in sincerity, prospers in every way. 

Be not misled by whited domes, 

A handful of his (or thy) earth is acceptable to the Almighty. 

I will bring thee offerings on a camel's back as often as day 

follows night, 

Declare, ye believers in God, that the One True God is Master of 

the Winds." 



192 Ghuhfd betrothals. 

The candidate is then admitted into the caste. He is made to eat 
a little cMirmd and rice out of the kardhi, drink some water and 
smoke. The rest of the churmd is distributed among the other Chuhfas 
and he is declared a member of the caste. 

In Hohtak B^lraiki sweepers admit a man of any caste into the 
Chulird ranks, except a Dh^nak, a S^nsi or a Dhia. The recruit is 
merely required to prepare IJ sevf^ of malida and. after placing it under 
Bdlmik's banner, worship the saint. The followers of Nd,nak admit 
converts of every caste into their ranks. 

In Grurgaon the rite of initiation is a revolting one and is thus de- 
scribed : — 

Over a rectangular pit is put a chdrpdi, and beneath it the candidate 
is seated in the pit, while the Chuhrd,s sit on the chdrpdi. Each bathes 
in turn, clearing his nose and spitting,'^ so that all the water, etc., falls 
on to ihe man in the pit. He is then allowed to como out and seated 
on the chdrpdi. After this all the Chuhrd,s wash his body and eat with 
him, and then ask him to adopt their profession. 

An initiate appears to be called Bhangi, or in Gnrgaon Sarbhangi. 
The latter, it is said, may smoke and eat with the Chuhrd,s, but are not 
admitted to intermarriage with them. 

Betrothal. 

When a betrothal takes place, the Idgi, the marriage functionary and 
o-o-between, goes to the house of the boy's parents, taking with him 
suo-ar and dates for the inmates. He states the purpose of his visit, 
and there is placed before him five or ten, or more, rupees, of which 
he takes one and goes. If the people are very poor they intimate to 
the Idgi how much he should take out of the heap. Returning to the 
house of the girl's parents he makes his report, describing the boy, bis 
prospects, circumstances, and so on. 

A Idgi now goes from the boy's residence, carrying clothes and 
jewels for the girl. He himself is presented with a turban {pagri) and 
songs are sung by the womankind. The bindingr portion of the cere- 
monies is where the turban is given to the Idgi before witnesses. 

In two, three, four, or five years, the girl's parents send the Idgi to 
say that it is time for the marriage. If the parents of the boy find it 
convenient, they declare that they are ready, and instruct the Idgi to 
ask the other house to send a nishdn, hahdchd, hahord, which is a present 
of three garments, one to the mirdsi, one to the ndi, and the third to 
the chuhrd who lights the fire. There is gur also in the basket contain- 
ino" the clothes, and this is distributed to the singing girls and others. 
The Idgi receives a rupee or two, and goes back with the news that the 
hahdchd has been accepted. Then a trewar, a present of seven garments, 
is prepared, and sent from the gii'l's residence, a white phulkdri (embroi- 



* Chuliras tliink that ttie dirt of their own bodies purifies others and they so remore 
it with their own hands. If a man follows their occupation but does not undergo the 
ordeal described above they do not treat him as a Chuhra or effect any relationship 
with him.

dered shawl), a chdb or chop (a red cotton shawl with a silk embroidered 
edge), a chdli (bodice), a kurtd (jacket), a daridi (narrow silk cloth), a 
lungi or sdya (a chenk cloth or petticoat), two pagria (turbans) and one 
chddar (sheet or shawl). The jacket has a gold button, hird, and three 
silver ones called allidn, and gota, or gold and silver lace, with the Go^ure 
of a man embroidered on the right breast or shoulder. This present 
is sent to the boy's residence, where the garments are spread out on a 
bed to give the inmates and friends an opportunity of seeing them. 
The Idgi takes with him also giir, patdsse (sweets), and a rupee as rofind, 
which he gives to the bridegroom. This rdpnd may be seven dried 
dates, and other tliiners. The boy's hands are dyed with maiudt (henna) 
to sifjnify joy. Again rupees are placed before tho logi, of which he 
takes as many as he has been instructed to take. He then says that 
such and such a day has been 6xed for the wedding and goes back to tell 
the bride's friends that the day is appointed. On this occasion songs 
are sung by the boy's sister and mother. 

Eight or nine days before the wedding they have what they call «iat 
pdnd, that is, they take ghungnid^'i (wheat roasted in the husk) to the 
quantity of five or six parSpi, which they put in tho boy's lap. This he 
distributes with gicr to his friends, of the same age as he is, seated on a 
basket. Wheat is distributed to the other friends, perhaps as much 
as four or five maunds, with gur. The boy is anointed with oil as 
many times as there are days before the marriage, and a song is sung 
by his friends. 

The ndi anoints the bridegroom to make hira sweet. The ointment 
is made of the flour of wheat and barley, kachiir (a drug), khardal 
(white mustard), chaihal charild (a scent), and oil. This preparation 
is called batnd. 

When the boy is taken off the basket they bind a gdnd (ornament) 
or Jcangnd (bracelet) on his wrist, which consists of an iron ring, a 
cowrie, and a manka (string) of kach (glass) beads. They put a knife 
into his hand at the same time. All this is to keep off the evil spirits. 
The same operation is performed on the giil by her friends ; only she 
puts on a kangni (wrist ornament) or churi (bracelet of iron), instead 
of taking a knife in her hand. 

Betrothal takes place at any time from five years of age and upward, 
the consent of the parents only being necessary. If the betrothal 
is cancelled, the painch aiTanges the amount to be repaid, and 
recoveT's it. 

When the wedding day approaches, a big dinner is given in the 
boy's home on a Wednesday, the entertainment extending to Thursday 
morning. This is called mel. 

The hharjdi, or gome other relative, with his wife, goes to the well 
for a jar of water, which they carry between them. With this water 
the ndi washes the biidegroom on a basket. His hair is washed 
with buttermilk and oil. Seven chapman (unburnt earthen plates) 
are placed before him. These ho breaks with his ftx . His uncle on 
the mother's side gives him a cow, etc., and the bride's uncle gives 
the same to her. The bridegroom puts on his new clothes, the old 



194 Chuhrd weddi7igs. 

ones being appropriated by the oidi. After his uncles have sung, his 
sister sings and gives him his clothes. 

He is then dressed on a rug after his bath ; the sdfd or turban is 
placed on his head, over which the sehra, or garland of flowers, is 
throvpn and saffron is sprinkled on his clothes. 

A tray is put down with a rupee in it, representing 101 rupees. 
On the rupee gur is spread, while they say, Jagat pai-wd^i sitpri so 
dharm, Ikotr sau rupaid ghar dd ; " According to the custom which 
binds us like religion, We lay before you 101 rupees of our own 
house." 

Then into the tray is put the tamhol or neundrd, i.e., the contribution 
given by wedding guests to defray the expenses of the festival. At 
each succeeding marriage one rupee more is given, or the same sum 
is given each time, if it is so arranged. Neundrd is given in the girl's 
home as well. This custom of giving at each other's wedding is a 
very binding one. Whoever receives neundrd from his guests must 
pay back in neundrd one and half or double the amount at their 
wedding feasts. 

The party now gets ready to go to the bride's home. The bridegroom 
is seated on a mare, or, if poor, he goes on foot. He is accompanied 
by the sarhahla, or bridegroom's friend, generally seated behind him 
on the same animal. On their way they give a rupee to the headmen 
of the villages they pass. This is for the poor. Fireworks blaze as 
they proceed, while the drums and other noisy instruments of music 
announce the coming of the bridegroom, who sits under a paper 
umbrella, or canopy, which has been made by the fireworks-man. 
This last-named individual gets money also on the way — a rupee or 
so. As they approach the bride's village the women and girls of the 
villagfc come out, singing, to surround the whole party with a cotton 
thread, as if they had made prisoners of them all. 

Meantime the bride has been dressed, and songs have been sung by 
her friends. 

Having arrived at the village they rest in a garden, or go to the 
ddrd, or traveller's rest-house, while dinner is being prepared. .A 
large tray is brought out {changer la I) with sugar in it. The lagis put 
some into the bridegroom's mouth, the rest beine: divided among the 
guests. The sarbahld, or bridegroom's friend, and the others prepare 
to go to the bride's house with the beating of drums. The two parties 
meet and salute one another. The bride's father gives a cow or a 
buffalo, but if he is poor he gives a rupee, which the mirasi, or village 
bard, gets. Nearing the house they find the way obstructed by a stick , 
[kuddan) placed across the path by the meMars, or dg hdlnihcdle, (fire- 
lio-hters). They must be paid a rupee before the party can proceed. 
They reach another grate formed by a red cloth held by women. This 
is chunni. The bride's sister receives a rupee at this stage. The 
mdchhi, or jhiwar {water-carrier), brings a vessel of water, and says, 
" Mere kumh dd lag deo, Give the price of my earthen water jar." 
He also receives a rupee. 

The marriage party now dine, while the women of the marriage 
party sbg. 



Chuhrd weddings. 195 

While the party dines outside, the lard (bridegroom) and the sarhdhld 
(friend) go inside the house. A chhdnani (a sort of sieve for cleanino- 
flour or wheat) ia placed over the door with a light barnino- in it. 
Thrt bridegroom strikes tins vvith a sword or knife seven times, knocking 
it down, light and all, with the seventh stroke. The sarhdhli, or bride's 
friend, comes wich a handful of oil and gur which she holds firmly, 
while the othei" girls tell the bridesfruom to open the hand with his 
little finger. This he tries to do, but the star fca/tZa advises him to use 
his thumb and press more forcibly. When her hand is opened, she 
rubs the bridt^groom's face with the mixture. The young lady also 
spits rice in his face — phurhrd. The bridegroom is then drawn into 
an inner room by means of a pair of trousers {piejdma) twisted round 
his neck. He has to give the girls a rupee before they let him go. 
They place a small tent made of reeds [ghdrdheri) like a tripod, on a 
IDiri (stool), and in it kujidil (small lamps and vessels) made of dough. 
One of tliese is lit, and the bridegroom is asked to put cloves into the 
little kujidn. 

They then take a tray and put it on a cup (katSrd). This they 
call tilkan. All the girls press down the tray on the cup with their 
hands one above another, telling the bridegroom to lift it up. He 
tries to do so but cannot, and the sarhdhld with his foot overturns it. 
This is the signal for the girls to giyegdli (abuse) to the sarhdhld : they 
pull his hair, slap him, push him about, and generally ill-treat him until 
the bridegroom at his cries for help asks them to desist. 

They deny having beaten him, and treat them both to sweets [laddu 
and pardkridTi) and sugar which they call hejwdri or hdjirl. The bride 
is now admitted and seated. They throw bits of cotton wool on her, 
wluch he picks off. He takes off her troubles, as it were. They throw 
them on him also. Daring these observances the girls sing at intervals. 

The bridegroom now walks seven times round the bride, and the 
bride seven times round him. He lays his head on hers, and she hers 
on him, after which she kicks him on the back. The others follow 
suit. It goes hard with the unhappy bridegroom then. They seize 
his chddar (shawl), and tie two pice in it. The bride then fastens it 
tightly round his neck, meaning by this that he is captured and is 
hallnn jogd nahin (unable to move). He recites the following 
couplet : — 

Maiyi hhafdngd, tan khdin. I will earn money, and feed you. 
Meri galo'n patkd Idhiii. RemoTe the shawl from my neck. 

The bride then takes off the chddar, but they tie it to the bride's 
shawl {gand chattr.ivd), meaning that they are now one. 

The girl ia bathed, the barber's wife {nain) braids her hair, then she 
flits on a {{ukra) basket under which is a light. Two pice are placed 
under her feet. The one that gives the bath gets the pice. The uncle 
gives the girl a cow, etc. Of the earth wetted with the water of the 
bath some is thrown to the ceiling. The mother passes before the girl 
a large basket made of reedi seven times. This is called khdrd langdi, 
and she then sing& : — 

Khdri chiitar machittar, The basket is of divers colours, 

Khdrd addiyd, And I sit on the basket. 

Khdre ton utdr. Take me ot! the basket, 

Mdrnmd vaddhiyd. Great uncle. 



198 Chuhrd weddings. 

The girl is taken away, and the bridegroom gives the barber's wife a 
rupee. 

The lagi is now sent to bring the clothes that the bridegroom has 
brought for tlie bride. Jewels also he brings, and she is fully dressed. 
These jewels are various — for the nose, huldk, laung, nath ; ear, 
dandidh, pattar, chaunke, bale ; neck and throat, /lass, harnel, takhtidn ; 
ioTehe'<i,d, chikkdn, chaunk,'ph{d ; arm, pi dan, bowattd,^ chura, gokhru, 
hangan ; fingers, chhdj) or chhalld, drsi ; foot, paajebdn, karidn. 

The bride is now ready and comes to be married. She is seated 
and the Brahman (or the Maulavi) is called. Four poles are stuck in 
the ground fastened together, with green branches above. The 
Brahman (or Maulavi) reads a service, and two pice are handed seven 
times. The Brahman says : Sntto; eki, meki, neki teki,pd6 dhangd, and 
snaps the pice. 

The bridegroom goes round the bride seven times, and she round him 
peven times under the green canopy. The Brahman gets four annas 
in pice, and one rupee. The married pair sit on a bed or seat, while 
the bride's people bring him clothes, which he puts on over the ones 
lie has. The mirdsi seizes his turban, and retains it until it is redeemed 
with a rupee. Tiie parents are next called, and water is brought to be 
sprinkled over the hands of the married pair. She is thus given over 
to him. They rise from the chdrpdi, and go inside, throwing backward 
over their heads barley and cotton seeds which had been placed in their 
laps. They do not take away all the blessing. 

A trewar (21 or 12, etc., pieces) of clothes is now given [khat), all 
shown to the assembled guests, and vessels also seven, viz., thai 
(platter), cJihannd (metal drinking vessel), loh (large iron baking pan), 
hardhi (trying pan), degchi (pot), kaixhhi (ladle), dhaknd (lid). There 
are 21 kalle, or scones, placed in the basket of clothes. The Idgis 
who take this away receive presents of money. The bridegroom's 
father gives alms to the poor at this point, and there is much crying 
and weeping as the bride prepares to leave her home. 

The bride is put into the doll (palanquin), and the bridegroom's 
father throws money on it, which goes to the poor. 

The bridegroom's party return home carrying the bride with them. 
At the bridegroom's house all the women sing at intervals. When 
they reach the house the mother is at the door. 

The mother has a cup of water in her hand, which she waves round 
the heads of the married couple. She then attempts to drink it seven 
times, the bridegroom preventing her. At the seventh time she drinks. 
Then they enter the house, and the bride is placed on a mat. All the 
bridegroom's relations are called, and a large vessel called a para i is 
brought, in which is a mixture of rice, ghi and sugar cooked. This is 
gotkundld. The* women seat themselves and of this they take a morsel 
and each puts a little m the bride's mouth. She, sharm ke mare (out of 
shame) refuses to take it, but they insist as they are her relations. 

The women all partake. They call this bharmddld, i.e., union with 
the family. If they do not have this meal, they do not admit the other 
party to family privileges. 



The Chuhrd tnukld,v^. I97 

After this the bride remains two days more in the house, and on the 
third and fourth day the women again gather. They take a pardt 
(tray) in wliich they put water and milk, or kachchi las^i, and in 
another vessel they put citd (meal). In the meal they put gur and ghi, 
mixing them together (gulrd). Into the tray of milk Hnd water they 
make the bride put her heel, and in it the bridegroom washes her foot. 
The bridegroom now puts in his foot, and she is told to wash it. This 
\b shagun. The bride unties her gdnd (wrist ornament), which is so 
securely fastened that they sometimes draw it over the hand, while 
they sing. It is thrown into the pardt o? uiilk and water. Then the 
bridegroom unfastens the bride's gdnd. 

It is placed in the vessel next. They are fastened together. The 
nain [Idgin] tnkos both and turns them round in the water seven times. 
She drops them in the water seven times, the bride and the bridegroom 
grabbing at them. The one that succeeds the oftener in getting hold 
of them first wins — the caste therefore wins. This is done amid great 
laughter. Only women are present, besides the bridegroom. 

The flour, ghi and sugar are then ciivided amongst them. Other 
Bongs are sung when the bride first comes to the house. The ^rirls also 
express their opinion of the dowry in a song. 

Mdklava, oe the Home-coming op the Bride. 

Next day the bride goes back to her father^s house, and there is sent 
after her kachchi piuni, or kachchi hhdji, which is rice flour with sugar. 
She returns to her husband's home in six months, or two years, or 
three, when there is mukldva, as sending home a wife is called. She 
brings a suit of clothes for her husbanil, one for her mother-in-law 
and one for her father-in-law. She wears kach, i. e., glass bracelets 
because she is still kachchi (unripe) ; not pakki. She now resides in 
her husband's, her own house. Various songs are sunt: on this occasion. 

A few branches of the Chuhr^s, including the Sotarwala, celebrate 
niarriagfes by the Muhammadan nikdh, but the great majority observe 
the Bindu p/iera. The following is a specimen of the songs {chhand or 
shlok) sung at aphera: — 

Pahli'm smirdn ek Unkdr, 

Duje guru Ganesh, 
Tije sviiran ddh Bhiicdni, 

8at dip nu kund jdni. 
Atvan ke dil tani sanwdre, 

Tin log ke kdraj sdre ;

Le hokar gurudwdre pati sab parwdr ; 
Ghar ghar turi mewa bichdr, 

Do Pdn4i bakhshish. 



198 Chtihrd huryings. 

One or two customs observed by the Chuhrd,g at marriages deserve 
notice :— 

On the evening when the bridegroom sets out for the bride's house, 
his mother cooks 10 sei's of rice sweeteued with gur, and invites all 
the women of the communifcy to eat each a mouthful of it. They 
then Hsk her to j^ive them a chhdj (a sieve for winnowing grain) and a 
doi (wooden spoon), and she at once does so. Two or three of the 
women, one of whom is wearing a ghaghm (the lower part of a 
petticoat) instead of a frock, get on top of the house with the chhdj and 
the doi, and the woman in the ghaghrd sings an obscene song at the 
top of her voice, beating the chhdj after every stanza so violently 
that it is broken to pieces. This custom is termed iiharuhd (foolery). 
It is an indispensible observance at a wedding. 

Last but not least comes the rite of admitting the bride into the 
bridegroom's got which is done in this wise : — 

Two or three days after the bride's arrival her mother-in-law 
prepares a maund and ten sers of sweet rice and serves it up on a 
large tray. Seven sohdgans (women whose husbands are alive) are 
invited, and they eat with the bride out of the tray. Unless this is 
done she is not considered a real member of the got. 

Bigamy is permissible, that is to say, a man whose wife is barren or 
who only gives birth to girls, may take a second wife. But he cannot, 
at least in Mdler Kotla, take a second wife if he has a son, under 
penalty of excommunication, nor can he take a third wife while the 
other two are with him. 

Divorce is practised. 

Death and burial. 

The Chuhras generally bury their dead. When a person is dyinj? 
they call in the Muhamraadan priest to read the sahdni, but if it is in 
a Hindu village where there is no mulla nothing of this nature is done, 
except that in some cases they lift the sick man on to the ground.* This 
they call satthar.f The dead are carried to the grave on a bed, bound 
in a shroud made of cloth, which is tied at the head and the feet like 
a sack, and in the middle. The body, after being washed with soap 
and water, is dressed in a jacket, a cap, and a sheet, or in two sheets, 
and is sprinkled with rose water. In the grave the shoulder is placed 
towards the pole star, and the feet to the east. If it is that of a young 
person they put a black blanket over the bier, if of an old person a 
red one. This is called khes. The priest sits on the west side and 
looks towards the east. He recites a prayer, and they repeat it after 
him. This is jandza. One rupee, called askdt,X is given to the priest 

* In Maler Kotla the Chuhras bury the dead, like Muhammadaiis, but on their way to 
the grave the carriers of the bier change places as among Hindus. And on their return 
they pick up straws and break them, saying, ' God bless the dead and protect those left 
behind', while the faqir, who usaally accompanies the parties, recites verses of Guru 
N4nak, like a Sikh. Three days later the deceased's nearest relative feeds the men who 
• carried the bier, and on the 17th day h^- listributea food to the poor and to unmarried 
girls.

becomes the property of the mirdsi. The face of the dead is not placed 
downwards. 

If a very old person dies, his fripnds make a mock mourning : bat 
their grief is really very great for a young person. 

They (the women) ''^ stand in a circle ; the mirdsan (wife of the 
family bard) stands in the centre. She sings mournful tunes, the 
other women following her. They beat their legs, breasts and fore- 
head with their hands in time to the dirge. Nothing could be sadder. 
The woman that leads repeats the aldhni, and the other women beat 
the breast, thus making sidpd. 

Purification Rites. 
After child-birth a woman is unclean for 21 days. In the period of 
menstruation she does not go to a well, and alter it she washes her 
clothes and bathes. After a funeral all who may have touched the 
dead body or the grave must bathe. 

Many Chuhras reverence sanghar,f in order that sanghat or trouble 
may be averted. 

Sanghar kd vart, — They have a special favour for Vaishnu Devi. 
They put mehndi on girls' hnnds, and tie a mauli, or cotton bracelet, 
round their wrists, feeding the girls also in the devVs name, that the 
children may be preserved. 

Devi dd vart. — On Thursflay night they liHve darud,X praying for 
the dead. They pour water into a cup, and take bread in their hands. 
They eat a little, drink a little, and give the remainder to a child. 
They have no special days. 

TIL— RELIGION. 

(a). — The Dedication op a Temple to Bala Shae. 

The principal goddesses or devis of the Hindus, e. gf., Kdli Devi, 
appear to be of low caste. This is especially noteworthy. 

When a shrine is made to Bala, the Chuhrd,s make a mound of earth 
in which they bury a gold knife, a silver knife, a copper knife, the head 
of a goat, and a cocoanut, all bound in Ij yards of red cloth. Having 
levelled the mound, or rather dressed it and made it neat and tidy, 
they raise on it a sort of altar of mud, in which they make three niches 
for lamps. Having put oil in the lamps and lighted them they place 
them in the niches. Goat's tiesh is cooked, of which part is eaten and 
part distributed to the poor. A chela performs the sacrifice, after 
which they all eat together. 

The order of rehgious ceremony is as follows : — A basket (changcrd) 
is placed near the mud altar^ which resembles a raised grave more 
than anything else, and in the basket there is churmdh, made of flour 
butter and sugar. In front of the altar the chela burns ghi with spices, 
such as camphor. He spriukles the assembled company with lasai 



* The women go half-way towards the graveyard weeping and wailing, 
f Sanghar is the pod of the jand tree, which is used as a vegetable by the poorer claues 
especially in times of ecarcity. 
J Darudfdtia — obseqaiea.

(butter milk or rather whey) for cooling purposes. Five pice are put 
in the ghi, which become the chela's, as a fee. Silver or gold is put 
in a cup of water and the water is sprinkled on the people. This is 
called chandii. The c/ieZa stands before the altar, the people standing 
behind him, while he recites a dedicatory Htanj. 

The Chuhr^s have a lofty conception of Bd-lmik, and believe that 
when he hoiioured the earth with his existence all the regions of 
heaven and earth were illuminated as described in the following 
verses, current in Maler Kotla : — 

Arise, mother Mainawanti, from slumber, 

Baba Bala has been incarnated. 
A trembling has come upon Paital, the dust 

has come off. 
Armies have come from Kumbaf shouting 

for Khwaja !

IV.— RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. 

(a). — Priests. 

With respect to their priests, whose names are Bala Shdh, Markhande. 
Mid,n Sura, Lai Beg, BRlmik, Jhaumpra, Pir Jhot^, Gungar Beg, Ail 
Maluk, they look on them as antdrs (incarnations) of the one Bala, 
Jhaumprd, in one of these traditions is called by Alif Chela, the tenth 
incarnation. 

The priests are called 'pir, and do duty at marriages and funerals. At 
marriages the mirdsi (bard) places a diva, lamp of dtd (dough) in a 
clean place and the people bow before it, while he says that the jot, or 
light of their ancestors, is being burnt. 

Their faqirs or sddhus are b'h^h Madd^ri, Naushahiyd,, Nangesh^hiya, 
Yatimsh^hiya, Bairiigi. The Sh^h Madariya has a lit, or bodi, and a 
rosary. The Naugeshaliiya have long hair plaited with bor kd dudh 
(the milk of the banyan tree) and washed with earth. They bind it 
round the head with a cord of wool, and wear over it a turban of yellow 
cloth. 'Phey wear a laro^e bead over the forehead. They go naked for 
twelve years, having the person smeared with ashes. 

The Bairagi is dressed much like the Nangeshahiya, but he carries a 
bairdgan, or prop, on which he sits. 

The Naushdhiya has the hair united. He wears a rosary, and on the 
wrist an ornament called a gajrd. His clothes are yellow — whatever 
he has of clothes. 

The Yatimshdrhiya is like the Baird,gi. 

The faqirs^ work is to expel evil spirits with their mantras (incanta- 
tions). 

(b). — Articles of faith. 
The tenets of their religion are especially — 
1. Sin is a reality. 2. There is one God. 3. Bd,ld, is a mediator. 

Sdddi MTi tere agge, Our cry is to thee ; 

Teri kuk dhur Dargde.—Amin. Thy cry reaches the presence of God. 

4. They sacrifice an animal, and also present offerings of corn, gur, 
ghi. It is cooked and placed on the shrine. It is called hafdhi. 



Chuhrd beliefs. 205 

The gydni, chela or priest, stands in front, the congi-ej^atiou behind 
him. When the gryani (knowing one) says, ' Bolo, moniino, sarhgati' 
they say, * Amin, sarbgati,' i.e., ' let all have salvation.' The victim 
sacrificed is a fowl or a goat according to their means. It is called 
All \h da Nam (God's Name). The i\.od is distributed and eaten, and 
the fanj sifateu (five attributes) are sung. 

5. The spirit returns to God. 

6. 'i'hero will be a resurrection of the body. 

7. There will be judgment. 

8. Tlierc are angels. 

The priests of the Chuhras are recruited from various sources. Thus 
in many parts of Gurgaon weddings are performed by pddhas, who 
will eat with Chuhras, though they are probably degraded Brahmans 
by caste, like the Cbamarwci. See also Lalbeqi. 

(c). — Shrines. 

The shrine in a village always faces the east. Ita shape is a dome, 
or, as they say, gdo dum ki shakal (like a cow's tail), upright. There 
are only lamps in it, no idols. The name of the shrine is Bala Shah. 

(d) . — Rites. 

They have no secret rites. Their shrine is worshipped on Thursdays, 
sacrifices are ofi:"ered, and also chiirmdn (a sweetmeat made of bread 
crumbs mixed with butter and sugar), and the gydjii prays. It is only 
at the consecration of a new slirino that the head of the animal sacrificed 
and knives are buried under the shrine. The shrine is built on the 
sacrifice and sacrificial weapons, as a foundation. 

There is no ceremony for admission among the Chuhrds, except 
participating in the hardhi. 

(e). — Saceifices, 

The animal sacrificed is a fowl, a goat, and perhaps a cow. 

The gydni, or a Muhammadan mulla, offers the sacrifice. 

The sacrifice is offered not near the ahrine but at a little distance 
from it. It is cooked and eaten. They also burn ghi, rdl or scented 
resin,* and guggal (a gum, used as incense) . This is called horn. 

When a child is born, he is brought on the twenty-first day and 
offered or consecrated to Billmik, and called Bdlinik ha bor. He is a 
nazar, or offering. 

(/). — Fetishism. 

Belief in spirits is general. A spirit may attach itself to a roof and 
break it, or to a well and throw a man in, or to animals and they will 
attack and injure man. A bad ruh (an evil-spirit) may meditate mischief 
and God sends a warning. This is called sabhdicak (of good intent). 

Good spirits attach themselves to wood and other things, especially 
cooking vessels. They bring blessings. 

Fields are haunted and may accordingly be barren.

206 Chuhrd beliefs. 

(g). — Ancestor- WORSHIP. 

The ChulirdiS fear the spirit of a woman who dies in childbirth, 
because she has become a churel, a witch that is to be dreaded. Faqirs 
have power over spirits and receive information from them of the 
designs of the spirit world. 

Bad dreams come from the dahdi (the pressure) of an evil spirit. To 
drive the evil spirits away BAlmik's name is taken. Sickness is caused 
by had ruh hi say a (the shadow of an evil spirit). Faqirs and jpirs 
drive away spirits \\it\\ jhdrd'^ karaund, jhdr phunkt (conjuring). 

Ghosts of the dead haunt houses, burial grounds, etc. They come as 
little boys vtith white hair. Not long since in this neigbourhood two 
children strayed from home in the gi'ey dawn and were seen by some 
of the villagers, who, not recognising them as children of the village, 
were terrified at the sight of them, believing them to be ghosts. I 
understand that the children ran some risk of being treated harshly, if 
not killed, as evil-intentioned ghosts. 

Churels have their feet pointing backwards. They have long paps 
which they throw over their shoulders. Their hair is long, and face 
beautiful. A dyer was returning home one day, when he met a churel, 
who accompanied him to his house. She was very attractive, for she 
concealed the marks by which he would have recognised her. But at 
night, wlien it was time to put outthe light, she did it with her hand, 
which she stretched to such a distance that the dyer in terror found 
he had a churel by his side. He would have given the alarm, but she 
threatened him and gave him a rupee. The fag ir found her out, how- 
ever, being set to do it by the dyer's friends. Usne use qdhu harliyd 
(he caught her). She then asked for her rupee and disappeared. 

If a woman dies before giving birth to her child, she certainly 
becomes an evil-spirit. When they bury her, they put a nail through, 
her hands and her feet, and put red pepper on her eyes. They place a 
chain round her ankles and so bury her. On the way home they sow 
■seti sarou (white mustard) that it may blind her. They have tuna for 
her, i.e., charms, otherwise she would come and hurt every one in the 
house. " This is a fact," said my informant emphatically ! 

At a certain stage of the incantations the cheld says, " Are you 
going ? " The spirit says, " Yes, but I wa,nt a fowl, a goat, a piece of 
cloth, etc." This is given, and the bad spirit goes. 

There are several kinds of spirits, churel, bhilt, kliavis, jinn, deo, pari. 
The churel we have described. The j^aris are churds when they come 
in companies. Kfaqir, who dies within his twelve years of faqiri, 
becomes a bhitt, or a khavis, or a jinn, or a deS. If he dies in his forty 
days of fasting, when he comes to eat one grain a day, he becomes a 
hhavis or a jmn, or a deo. 

Totems.

Goriye. It is especially revered.

Chuhrd omens and oaths. 207 

Among the Gils, the haingyah (egg plant) is particularly noticed. 
The chiefs name was Parth, so they do not eat the 'part* (rind) of the 
haingyan. 

Women never take the name of their zdt (caste) on their lips. 

V.-SUPERSTITIONS. 

Omens and Names. 

If a Chuhrd goes on a journey and meets a rnirdsi, he goes back. 
If some one calls after him he goes back. The braying of a donkey 
meeting him is a good omen, if a washerman meets a man beginning 
a journey, it is sufficient to send him back, certain of failure if he goes 
on. Some men are known to carry good fortune, and are sent out to 
meet travellers. 

A Chuhra never steps over a broom. The broom that is used to sweep 
corn ia hung up on a nail in the house. That for ordinary use is placed 
on a grave, bat never upright. 

Children are frequently given names arising out of superstitions : thus, 
Kakd is used as a first name. Ghasita means dragged, that is, dragged 
over a dust heap, ruri. Rur^ hH.s the same meaning. As the name is 
one of dishonour, tlie evil-eye will not fall on the children that bear it. 
Likar means having half of tho liead shaved, and the other not ; this ia 
to keep the child alive. Nathu means having a ring in the nose, to 
hold him and keep him from going away, i.e., dying. 

Oaths, magic and witchceaft. 
The oath by B^la Shdh is used. 

The practice of magic arts is confined to /ajiVg and pzV«. It is the 
sauhrief that bring evil-spirits. A person possessed is cured in the 
following manner : — The/ag-iV takes a drum, a thdli or platter and a 
ghard or earthen jar. The platter is placed over the jar, and the whole 
is called gharidl.X Thefaqir beats the drum, another person beats the 
gharidl, and others sing. The sick person shakes his head, and when 
the music (?) ceases they ask him questions: " Who are you ?" " I am 
so and so," he replies. " How did j on come into this state?" "Such 
and such a one put me into this state." " Who bewitched you ?" " So 
and so." " What did he get for doing it ?" '•' So many rupees." " For 
how long are you sick? "I have to be sick so many days, and then 
die." They play and sing again. After a time the sick man perspires 
and recovers. The evil-spirit goes with the perspiration. 

A curious and repulsive cure is used among Hindus and probably 
others. It is called jari or niasdn. An unmarried person dies, and his 
or her body is burnt at the burning ghdt. A faqir takes some of tho 
ashes from the burning pile, goes to tho hills for a certain plant, and 
makes bread of these two ingredients on a grave. The broad is made 
into pills, one of which is given to a naked childless woman. She gives 
the pill in a drink to her enemies, and herself has a child. Her barren 
condition was caused by an evil-spirit. Masdn means demon, and burn- 
ing-place among Hindus. 



* Part is the form given in Maya Singh's Punjabi Dictionnry, p. 877. 
I Sauhrd,— i, lit. (I) parenta-in-law; (2) Bimpieton, wretch. 
% Qharidl, lit. a gong. 



208 Chuhrd social customs. 

Jhundd is an iron whip which a faqir beats himself with for the 
sake of another, so that the evil-spirit in him may be troubled and flee. 
They also burn oil in a tavd (iron dish). The faqir puts his hand in 
the hot oil and pours it on his person. The evil-spirit feels it, but the 
faqir does not. Tho faqir also beats his body with a millstone. After 
the sick man recovers, the faqir takes a fowl, kills it, dips a string in 
its blood, knots the string, blows on it, and finally binds it round the 
sick man's neck, assuring him that the evil-spirit will not come again. 
If the man goes where there is impurity [sutak] the virtue in the string 
disappears. 

Dreams are from evil-spirits, and the Chuhras fear them. To dream 
that a person who is dead is cutting flesh, is an intimation that there 
will be a death in the house. Muhammadan Sayyids give the ta^wix (a 
charm) to keep away dreams. 

The evil eye is universally believed in. Some men are very injurious 
in this way. If a man with the evil eye looks at any one taking food, 
sickness follows. To cure this, the sick person asks a bit from the 
evil-eyed man when he is at a meal. The morsel given acts as a cure. 
"When a cow is sick, and gives no milk, they give her a bit of the 
evil-eyed {had nazr) man's food. 

Sorcerers and witches act on their victim by making a figure of him 
and torturing the figure by inserting a needle into it. The torture 
reaches the person who is personated. Nails and hairs are carried 
away to be subjected to pain that the original owners 'may be tormented. 
They are carefully thrown away when cut off, lest any enemy should 
get possession of them. Women are especially careful in this parti- 
cular. 

Sickness is caused by evil spirits. 

Ceremonial prohibition or taboo. 

The Chuhrds never touch a Gagra, or a Sansi, gipsy. Women and 
children do not go near graves. The daughter-in-law never mentions 
the father-in-law's name. Chuhras do not eat monkeys, or snakes, or 
jackals, or rats. 

Agricdltdeal superstitions. 

Crops are cut on a Sunday, Monday, or Friday, and sown on a 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 

If the Chuhyd,s burn a siip (winnowing sieve or fan) in a village, the 
farmer is injured. It is a curse— the curse of the poor. 

Social cdstoms. 

The household eat together, but the women eat after the men. If 
men eat after women they are injured, because women are weak of 
intellect. 

' Yd jidh ya jhuth, donon nuqsdn pahuchdnde : ' * Food touched by 
others and falsehood are both injurious.' They use shardb (strong 
drink), opium {aflm, post, hhang) and charas. Drunkards are despised. 

Customs op social intercourse. 
In salutation, they say pairie pan to the great, the answer being terd 
hhald kare Khudd. Also mathd teknd, saldm. 



Chuhrd vocations, 209 

COSTOMB BEARINa ON SOCIAL STATUS. 

They eat paJcki among themselves, and kachchi with Gagre and 
Sd,nsis. They smoke only among themselves. No caste above them 
eats with them. 

VI.— OCCUPATION. 

The oEioiNAL work op the Chdhras. 
They were the tanners of the village communities, and used to lire 
in huts at a distance from the village, the walla of which were made of 
bones, and the roof of skins. When an animal died, the Hindus beat a 
drum to let them know that they must come and carry off the dead 
body. Five rupees was the fee given and also a ehroud. The 
Chuhr^s took off the animal's hide and ate its flesh. Sweeping was 
also their work. 

Formerly, when a Hindu died, the Chuhrds received a sheet or 
Jcafan (nhroud), and they still receive clothes. In the old days they 
got five rupees at the Hindu burning-place, and exacted it with clubs. 
If a cow dies on a Hindu's laud they call it dushndy and the Hindu 
who takes the cow's tail to the Ganges to be purified is beaten there by 
a Chuhra with a shoe. 

VII.— RELATIONS TO LAND. 

Nowadays their work is farm service. They are landless day- 
labourers on the farm. They are divided into — 

(1) The dthr%, who gets a maund of wheat for every mdni at the 
harvest ; also odds and ends. He has ghundidn, pir de ddne, the barley 
that is sown in a strip round the wheat field; wheat soAvn by the water- 
course ; bread twice a day ; clothes and shoes twice a year ; tobacco ; 
vegetables and wood : 

(2) The se'p hhulli, who receives three-quarters of a maund for every 
mdni, and bread daily if he goes to a distance to work ; and 

(3) The wife, who takes away dung from the farmyard, and receives 
half a maund of corn. 

It was cow-burying that led to their isolation. They say the Mdchhi, 
the Jhiwar, thn Chuhrd, the Changar, and the Mird,si are all of the 
same caste, but have different occupations. 

There is a story told of the Chuhras by Muharamadans and others 
that does not reflect to their credit. They are believed to be inclined 
to be uppish and to forget past favours, being ungi-ateful, and are 
supposed to work best when they are well beaten, otherwise they take 
advantage of the kindness of their masters. I give this only as the 
opinion of their neighbours. 

The story ia that once on a time the king of the Chuhrfls met Moses, 
who was on his way to talk with God.* The king of the Chubrds asked 
Moses to carry a petition to God from him, that he might be enabled to 
take the usual tax from people passing through his territory. Moses 
accordingly presented the king's petition, but God said, " Moses, you do 



* They and others call Moses Mihtar Mdsa; mihtar being a title of distinction, although 
used mostly for the Chnhfas. 



210 Chunian^Churdhi. 

not know what yon are doing, yon do not know this people. They will 
turn on you, and dishonour you in the end.*' But Moses persevered, 
and obtained for the Chuhrd king what he desired, viz,, that he should 
levy taxes on travellers. The next time Moses passed that way he 
was accosted in a most humiliating manner. " Oh Musri, are you the 
man that carried a petition for me ? You must pay the dues." " Did 
I not tell you, Moses," snid God, " that you would bring dishonour on 
your head. They have no gratitude." 

IX.— THE TRADITIONS OP THE CHUHR^S. 

The Chuhrds have oral traditions which they recite at their gather- 
ings. If a Chuhrd, wishes to learn them, he becomes the disciple of some 
one who is in possession of them, i. e., who can repeat them from 
memory. I heard, however, that there was a book of the Chuhrds in 
Gujrd,nwala District, but I was unable to obtain it, as the owners had 
the idea that I would use it to their disadvantage, 

Chdnian, a Muhammadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Churahi is the generic name for the people of the Chur&h. wizdrat, in Chamba 
State, who include Brahmans, Rdjputs, Thdkurs, Rdthis, and the follow- 
ing low castes : — Hdlis, Kolis, Sippis, Barw^las, Lohdrs, Chamdrs, 
Dumnas, Rih^ras, Chandls, Meghs, etc. The low castes are all endog- 
amous. 

Tradition makes the Thdknrs descendants of the old R^n^s, or petty 
chieftains, who held Chamba, prior to the foundation of the State by the 
Rdjd,s, and the Hdlis, its oldest inhabitants. It also makes the Brahmans 
immigrants from Brahmaur and the Rajputs from the plains ; but the 
Rdthis preceded these two castes, having been expelled from the Dugar 
counti'y by Gugga Chauhd,n — a curious legend. 

Marriage among the Churdhis is adult, and women are allowed every 
license before marriage. Three degrees on either side, counting from 
the grandparents, are avoided, but otherwise there are few restrictions, 
Brahmans intermarrying with Rd,this, by both forms of marriage, and 
also with Rdjputs and Thdkurs. Polyandry is not recognized, but polygamy 
is, and the first or head wife (bari Idri*) is given Rs. 6 when a second 
wife is admitted into the house. This fee is caWed jethw a ghf. 

The observances at betrothal are simple. The initiative is taken by 
the boy's people, and the binding rite consists in the boy's agents placing 
eight Chamba coins, worth nearly 2 annas, in the plates used for enter- 
taining the bride's ruhdrus or representatives, and giving one rupee 
for ornaments to the girl. 

Marriage is of three kinds. In the superior form, called ^'awatj, the per- 
liminaries are as follows : — Some six months before the wedding the boy's 
father or brother goes to the girl's house with one or two friends and gives 
her father Rs. 7 and a goat as his Idg^. A rupee is also given to the 
bride to buy ornaments, and this is called handhd dend\\. If the parents

Weddings in Churdh, ^ll 

agree, an auspicious day is fixed for the wedding, and a day before it two 
messengers {dhdmu*) from the bride's house come to fetch the boy, who 
worships the family deva or devi. Next day, accompanied by a few friends 
and one of the dhdmu, he goes to the bride's house. One of the boy's 
menial Hdlis accompanies him, carrying the badhdi^f, a present of two 
mdnisX o^ grain, to her father. This Hdli is called putridr^. On his 
arrival at the entrance the boy worships the kumhk\\ (a vessel full of 
water) ; throwing two copper coins into it and then seating himself on a 
blanket placed near the wall. The bride's sister now has a mimic fight 
with him and does not let him sit down till he has paid her two annas. 
This is called bishk^. She then fetches the bride and seats her by the 
boy whose future brother-in-law brings a vessel of boiled rice which he 
and the boy's brother scatter over the floor. This is called bhdt 
chingdna*''^. The pair are then seated, as are the guests, and a feast with 
songs and dancing follows. The bride's dowry called sudytt is then given 
to her by her parents. In the afternoon the boy's party returns to his 
house with two or three of the girl's friends, and the bride herself and 
other men and women of the bride's party. Before leaving the threshold 
of the bride's house the ceremony of drtiH is performed, a lighted lamp 
being waved four times rouud the head of the pair by a priest, who 
recites verses from the SukUmber and Deo Lild. At the boy's house this 
observance is repeated, and the kumhh worshipped by the bride and 
bridegroom, at the door. Then the boy's mother lifts up the bride's veil 
and presents her with a rupee or half a rupee according to her position. 
This is called ghundu^^ khard karnd. After this a feast is eaten and 
another feast given on the following day, and songs and dances performed. 
The binding portion of the ceremony is when drti is waved round the 
couple's heads at the boy's house. At his wedding the boy wears a high 
peaked cap like a Gaddi's, but not a sehra || || . 

Within a month after the marriage the married pair pay a visit to the 
wife's parents and make them a small present. This observance is 
called har-phera^^i. 

Widow remarriage is recognised. Formerly the widow was obliged to 
many one of the deceased husband's brothers, but now this is not the 
practice. She can choose her own husband within her own caste or 
sub-division. This union is solemnized by an inferior form of marriage 
called sargudhi'^^*. There are no dhdmu, and the bridegroom simply 
goes to the woman's house with his putridr and brother. The bandhd is 
given as at a regular wedding, but drti is not performed, and there is less 
feasting and the cost is much less. The binding ceremony in this form 
is when an ornament is put on her, usually a nose-ring.

212 Marriage in Ghurdh, 

A quiet form of sargudhi marriage is called garih chdra*. The lag, 
etc., are all rendered as iii the other form, but on an auspicious day the 
bridegroom accompanied by his sister simply goes to the bride's house, and 
at the entrance worships the kumhh. He then seats himself on the blanket 
in the usual way, and the girl is seated next him by her mother. After 
eating the couple take leave of the girl's father and proceed to the boy's 
house where the kuinbh is again touched. This second worship of the 
kumhh makes the marriage binding. 

The third and lowest form of marriage is the handhd ludndf in which a 
widow, who is to marry her husband's brother, is married to him on the 
kiria day, i.e., 7th to the 11th or ISthday after the first husband's death. 
She puts aside her late husband's ornaments and puts on his brother's, in 
token that she accepts him. A he-goat is sacrificed at home to the de- 
ceased husband and a small feast usually given. The widow's parents need 
not attend, but they are entitled to a lag, called hakrd, as being the price 
of a goat. If the widow wishes to marry a stranger, he must pay the 
hakrd of one rupee, and Re. 1-8 or Rs. 3 as chadydliX to her parents. An 
auspicious day after the kiria karm period is ascertained from a jotshi,^ 
and the ornaments changed as described above. 

Lastly a man who elopes with a girl can, after a certain interval, open 
neo'otiatioiis with her father, and if he assents, pay him Rs. 7 and a goat as 
compensation. This observance is termed lag rit\\ and operates as a valid 
marriage.! 

The custom of gharjawdntri or service in lieu of a money payment for 
a wife, is common among all castes in the State, especially in the Churah 
and Sadr wizdrats. The term of service is usually three or seven years, 
and the marriage may take place at any time if the girl's father is agreeable. 

A husband may divorce his wife if he cannot get on with her. The 
divorce is complete if the husband receives back his ornaments and says : 
" I have divorced you, Bdjd ki durohi^^/' i.e., on the Rajd,'s oath. The 
husband also breaks a stick in her presence. Divorced wives can 
remarry if they like. 

In succession all sons, even bastards, if recognized by the father, 
succeed on equal terms, but the eldest son gets the best field as his 
jethwdgh ; the second son gets a special implement, sickle, sword or axe 
as his hathidr, while the third gets the family house as his mulwdher. 

The son {rand put) or daughter {rand dhidff) of a widow born in 
her husband's house has all the rights of her deceased husband's own 
children. It is, however, essential that the widow should continue to live 
in her husband's house and the child be begotten therein.

^ Marriage customs differ considerably in the eastern and western portions of Churah, and

uncommon ; but the other forms are as above.

Tenv/res in Churdh. 213 

All doad Hindus except children not yet tonsured are burnt. The 
head is placed towards the north and the hands on tho chest, the face 
being turned skyward. _ Tho Hindu rites are, in essentials, observed, but 
tho place of the achdraj is taken by the Bhd^. 

For seven, nine or thirteen days mourning is observed, only one meal 
a day, called upas*, being eaten, and on tho day on which mourning is to 
cease, a suit of good woollen clothes (which are prepared beforehand in 
anticipation of death and worn on festival days) is given to the priest 
, who presides over the obsequies. Sixteen balls of rice are prepared 
and offered to the deceased's ancestors and finally removed and 
thrown into the nearest stream. The relations of the deceased also 
wash their clothes and a he-goat is killed. Then a feast is given to the 
relations and the mouruing ends. This feast is usually given by the 
deceased's wife's parents. Ceremonies are performed and balls made 
and offered after one, three and six months, a year and four years, to 
the deceased. At the latter, i. e., at the end of the fourth year, called 
chuharhi, the ceremonial is done on a big scale. 

The obsequies of any man who dies childless are done in tho same way, 
but if he brings any calamity on the household an effigy is made and 
placed near a spring or on the roof of the house or in some good place 
and worshipped by offering him a cap, bread, and an earthen pot of ghi 
which are finally worn and eaten by the man who is supposed to have 
been affected by him. The spirit of the person who dies a violent death 
is appeased by taking an earthen pot full of boiled ghi, a pitcher full of 
water, and a goat to the spot where he met his death, aad the goat is 
killed there and his head and the vessels rolled down the hill. This is done 
onthepaniydru, i.e., on the hiria harm day. The people perform sarddh. 
Ceremonies are also performed for the propitiation of ancestors in 
general, t 

The Chur^his are zaminddrs and hold land on two forms of tenure. 
Those who pay half its produce are called ghdrdX and those who pay a 
fixed share of gi'ain, etc., are called mudydri.^ The half share is alone 
divided after deducting the seed for the next crop. Occupancy tenants 
are not allowed any special privilege in the shape of remission of rent or 
favourable rates. The Chur^his are primarily and essentially cultivators, 
but many of them own flocks of sheep and goats with which, like the 
Gaddis, they visit Pdngi in summer and tho low hills in winter. 

The Churd.hia worship the deities on the following days :— 

Shiv — Sunday, Monday and Thursday. 

Sdkti — Sunday, Moaday and Tuesday. 

Nag or Mahal — Thursday and Saturday. 

Kailu — Thursd ay . 

Kyelang — Sunday and Thursday. 

Sitla — Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.

21* Churdhi festivals. 

To Shiv are offered a chola or woollen coat, a sheep, charms of silver 
oblono; in shape worn round the neck, a nddi (a silver-arch ornament 
shaped like a drnm). These offerings are taken by the head of the 
family, and the ornaraentjg are worn by him out of respect for Shiv and 
to avert his wrath. To Sakti Devi are offered, as elsewhere, a goat, 
trident and cakes. The offerings to a Nd,g are an iron mace {khan(fa), 
a crooked iron stick {kundi), (these are left at the shrine), a sheep and 
cakes (these are divided among the priest, chela and worshipper, and 
eaten). To Kailu are offered a red cap, an iron mace and a kid. The 
cap and part of the kid go to the priest, the rest to the worshipper. 
Kyelang's offerings are a mace, a goat and a red cap. Sitla^s offerings 
are a goat and cakes like the Devi's. Chaand gets cakes, and occasion- 
ally a goat, is also sacrificed at her shrine. 

Churahis make a pilgrimage to Manmahesh in Bhadon or in Asuj, on 
the Drub Ashtami day. 

Blocks of wood or stone which are supposed to possess some super- 
natural attributes are worshipped. When a deity is to be set up for the first 
time and consecrated, a Brahman's presence is necessary. The priests 
preside at shrines; and in dwellings the elder members of the household. 
Priests are not selected from the Brahman class only, but from all the 
other castes except low castes. Brahmans, Rdjputs, Rathis andfhakkara 
are eligible to hold the position of a priest. 

The following are some of the festivals observed in Churd,h :— 

1. Biswd., on 1st Baisd,kh, at which pindri or balls of grain are eaten 
with honey and ghi or gur. People also collect together tor singing and 
dancing, this being the Hindu New Year's Day. 

2. Patvom ki sankrdnt* on 1st Bhadon, held in memory of their 
ancestors. Flour is mixed with water, salt and spices and spread on 
bhuji leaves, called patroru, and eaten. 

3. Masru, held on the same day as the Drub Ashtami at Manimahesh 
in honour of Shiva — that is, on the eighth day of the light half of 
Bhadon. It is accompanied by dancing. 

4. Several of the ordinary melas observed in the capital, such as

bracelets of bell-metal or any other material except silver or gold.

Dadupanthi, — Founded by DiLdu,* a Gaur Brahman, who died in 1703. The 
Dddupanthi sect is usually divided into three orders : — 

(*) Ndga3,t found in the villages about Jaipur : they wear the 
choti or scalp-lock, and ornaments, and are wrestlers, fencers 
and on occasion warriors ; 

(»i) the Viraklas,J who wear ochre-coloured garments and do not 
livo in houses ; 



* Didu was born at Ahmad4bad in Ouzerit, wbence he migrated to Narilina 50 
miles south-west of Jaipur and now the head-qnarters of the sect. At the gurHdwdra 
hero the D^d^panthis assemble in Ph^gan and thence go to Sambhar where a fair ia 
held on the Hnniversary of Dado's death. Regarding his birth, tradition avers that an a"ed 
Brahman had no son, but one day God, in the guise of an old man, told him in response'^ to 
his prayers, that he would find floating on the river a box containing a male child, sucking 
its toe. He did so, and his wife's breasts miraculously filled with milk, so that she 
was able to suckle the child. When the boy was 10 years old, the aged man again appear, 
fid to the boy and gave him some betel from his own mouth, whereby all secrets were 
revealed to him, and the old n.an then named him Dadii Jiv, bidding him remain 
celibate and found an order of his own. Dadii then exclaimed ; Dddit gaih mahin gur 
dev mild, pdyd ham parshdd, Mastak meri kar dharyd dekhd agam agdd. " By chance J 
found a guru ; he gave me pnrshdd and laid his hands upon my hend, whereby all secrett 
were revealed to me.'' Didii'a death is assigned to Sbt. 17G0 (1703 A.D.) • but he 
is nlso said to have been 6th in descent from Riiminand. If so he flourished in 1600 
A. D. Other accounts make him contemporary with Dar4 Shikoh, others with Govind 
Singh. According to Vacauliffe, Sikh Religion, VI, p. 140, the D^dupanthfa place D4dd's 
death at the same time and place as Kabir's. 

t N4ga is said to be derived from Sanskrit ndgvaka, naked, but thero ia the usaal play 
on the words nanjfa (naked) and nag, snake. The Nig4s are mercenary soldiers in 
Jaipur and other States of R4jputana but are not known in the Punjab. See below 
also. 

J Virakta simply means ascetic. Mr. Maolagan eaya the celibates of to-day wear 
white, shave the beard and moustache, and wear necklaces, with white round caps to 
whiob ia attached a piece of cloth which hangs down the baok^-olearly the kapdli. 



216 The Dddupanthia. 

{in) the Uttradhas, who shave the head with the beard and mous- 
tache,''^ wear white clothes, and generally practise as physi- 
cians; besides 

(iv) the secular Dddupanthis, who are called Bistardharis. 

Dadu is said to have had 52 disciples who established as many deras 
or resting places.t The head of each dera, the deraddr, presents 
contributions to the gaddi-nashin or incumbent of the guru'dwdra at 
Nardind, who is elected by a conclave of the deraddrs. The eect is 
recruited from the Brahman, Kshatriya, Rdjput, Jdt and Gujar castes, 
but never from those of menial rank 4 As a rule children are initiated. 

Dddu composed a book called the Dddu Bani, of 5,000 verses, some of 
which are recited by his followers, after cheir ablutions every morning. 
In the evening drti is performed to it by lighting lamps and reciting 
passages from it.§ Dd,du forbade idolatry, built no temples,|| and 
taught the unity of God. In salutation his votaries use the word Sat 
Rdm, the " True God." But, in spite of Dd,du's denunciation of idolatry, 
his hair, his tumha (cup), chold (gown) and kharsun (sandals) are 
religiously preserved in his cave (guphd) at Sdmbhar.^ 

Before a guru admits a disciple the privations and diflficulties of jog 
are impressed upon him, and he is warned that he will have to 
remain celibate, live on alms, abstain from flesh and stimulants, and 
uphold the character of his order. In the presence of all the sddhus 
the guru shaves off the disciple's choti (scalp-lock) and covers his head 
with the hapdli (sknll-cap), which Dd,du wore. He is also given a 
kurta of hhagwd (ochre) colour, and taught the guru-mantra which he 
must not reveal. The rite concludes with the distribution of sweets. 

On a guru's death the usual Hindu rites are observed, and on the 
I7th day a feast is given to the sddhus. A fine tomb is sometimes 
erected outside the dera, in memory of the deceased, if he was wealthy. 

Although the Dddupanthis proper are celibate, both men and women 
are admitted into the community, and a great many have taken to 
marriage without ceasing to be D5,dupanthi8. These form the histat' 
dhdri or secular group, which should probably be regarded as a 
separate caste. Many of them are merchants, especially in grain, and 
wealthy. 



* The Utfcradhi have a guru at Rathia in Hissar. See below. 

•j- Of these 52 digoiples, Raijab, Gharib Dis and Sundar D43 were the chief. Raijab 
was a Muhammadan ; it is said that Muhammadana who follow Dad^ are called Uttradhi in 
contradistinction to the Hindu Dadiipanthi8 who are called Nagf. But the N^gi is 
clearly the N4ga already described, and Uttradhi can only mean " northern." 

The second, Gharib DAs, composed many hymns, still popular among Hindus, but his 
followers are said to be mostly Chamirs, who cut the hair short and wear cotton quilting. 
Bundar Dig composed the Sahya, a work resembling the Sikh Qranth. 

J But see the foregoing foot-note. The followers of Gharib Das. at any rate, elude 
Ohamirs, and Mr. Maclagan adds that many adherents of the sect are found among the 
lower castes. 

§ According to Wilson the worship is addressed to Kama, the deity negatively described 
lntheVed4nta theology. 

II Now temples are built by his followers who say that they worship " the book '' in them. 

<|| Mr. Maclagan adds : " In fact, the doctrine of Dadu is sometimes described as 
pantheistic. It is contained in several works in the Bhasba tongue which are said to 
include many of the sayings of Kabir. Accounts of the guru and his followers are given 
in the Janm-lila."

Dadwd I — Ddgi. 217 

Dadwal. — The Rdjput clan to which belongs the ancient ruling family of 
Datarpur, but said to take its name from Ddd'i in Kiuigra on the 
Hoshidrpur border. The Rdnds of Bit Manasw^l, or tableland of the 
Hoshi^rpur Siwaliks were Dadwdl Rajputs, and the clan still Lolds 
the tract. 

The Dadw^ls are found in the neighbourhood of Datd,rpur, the seat 
of their former sovereignty, and on the south-west face of the Siwd,lik3 
in Hoshidrpur tahsil near Dholbdha and Jatiauri or Jankipuri, its 
ancient name, which is .still used. Jdnnk was an ancienfc Surnjbausi 
ruler. The Dadwdls are a branch of the Katoch and do not intermarry 
with them, or with the Golerid,3 or Sibd,yas on the ground of a common 
descent. They have an interesting local history which describes how 
they wrested the tract round Datdrpur from a Chdhng rdni. 

The Dadvv^ls have several als or families, whose names are derived 
from their settlements, such as Janaurach, Dholb^hia, Datd,rpurift, 
Fatehpuria, Bhdmnowdlia, Khangwarach, Naruria, Rdmpuria, etc. 
Datiirpur is their chief village, but they have no system of chhats 
and makdns. (For their history and the septs which intermarry with 
them see the Hoshidr'pur Gazetteer, 1904, pp. 48-9.) 

DaprIna, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

Daqar, a Jat tribe, numerous in Delhi and Gurgdon, and with a small 
colony in Rohtak. 

DAaf, Dagdi, (from (^o'gr/i,,''^ a blemish ; the word ddghi is a term of abuse 
in KuUu), a generic term for an impure caste in Kullu. Koli is 
hardly a synonym, though, according to Ibbetson, these two words, 
together with a third, Chanel, are used almost indifferently to describe 
the lower class of menials of the highest hills. The Koli of the 
plains is easily distinguishable, by his locality, from the Koli of the 
hills. The former is probably nothing more than a Chamar tribe 
immigrant from Hindustan ; the latter, of Kolian origin. The two 
would appear to meet in the Siwaliks. Cunningham believed that 
the hills of the Punjab were once occupied by a true Kolian race 
belonging to the same group as the Kols of Central India and Behar, 
and that the present Kolis are very probably their repret^entatives. 
He points out that dd, the Kolian for water, is still used for many 
of the smaller streams of the Simla hills, and that there is a line of 
tribes of Kolian origin extending from Jabbalpur at least a<? far as 
AlUhd,biid, all of which use many identical words in their vocabularies 
and have a common tradition of an hereditary connection with work- 
ing in iron. The name of Kullu, however, he identifies with Kulinda, 



* But according to the late Mr. A. Anderson : — " The popular explanation of the word 
Dagi is that it is derived from (iflfir cattle, because they drau away the carcasses of dead 
cattle and also eat the flesh. If a man says ho is a Koli, then a Kanet turns round on 
him anl asks him whether he does not dmg carcassea ; and on his saying he does, the 
Kanet alleges he is a Dagi, and the would-be Koli consents. There are very few in 
Kullu proper that abstain from touching,' the dead. There are more in Saraj, but they 
admit tliey are called either Bagis or Kolis, and that whether they abstain from touching 
carcasses or not, all eat, drink and intermarry on equal terms. It is a mere piece of 
afiectation for a man who does not touch the dead to say he will not intermarry with 
the family of a man who is not so fastidious. This is a social distinction, and probably 
also indicates more or less the wealth of the individual who will not touch the dead." 



^18 Ddgis. 

and thinks that it has nothing in common with Kol. KoU, the 
ordinary name for any inhabitant of KuUd, is a distinct word 
from Koli and with a distinct meaning. 

The names Koli, Ddgi, and Chanel seem to be used to denote almos* 
all the low castes in the hills. In the median ranges, such as those 
of K^ngra proper, the Koli and Chanel are of higher status than 
the Ddgi, and not very much lower than the Kanet and Ghirth 
or lowest cultivating castes ; and perhaps the Koli may ba said to 
occupy a somewhat superior position to, and the Chand.1 very much 
the same position as, the Chamar in the plains, while the D^gi 
corresponds more nearly with the Chuhra. In Kullu the three words 
seem to be nsi^d almost indifferently, and to include not only the 
lowest castes, but also members of those castes who have adopted 
the pursuits of respectable artisans. The interesting quotations from 
Sir James Lyall give full details on the subject. Even in Kdngra 
the distinction appears doubtful. Sir James Lyall quotes a tradition 
which assigns a common origin, from the marriage of a demi-god 
to the daughter of a Kullu demon, to the Kanets and Ddgis of 
Kullu, the latter having become separate owing to their ancestor 
who married a Tibetan woman, having taken to eatmg the flesh 
of tlie yak, which, as a sort of ox, is sacred to Hindus ; and 
he thinks that the story may point to a mixed Mughal and Hindu 
descent for both castes. Again he writes : " The Koli class is 
" pretty numerous in Rdjgiri on the north-east side of pargana 
" Hamirpur ; like the Kanet it belongs to the country to the east of 
" Kdngra proper. I believe this class is treated as outcast by other 
" Hindus in Rdjgiri, though not so in BiUspur and other countries 
" to the east. The class has several times attempted to get the Katoch 
" Rdjd to remove the ban, but the negotiations have fallen through 
*' because the bribe offered was not sufiBcient. Among outcasts the 
•'Chamars are, as usual, the most numerous." Of pargana Kdngra he 
writes : " The Dagis have been entered as second-class Gaddis, but 
" they properly belong to a different nationality, and bear the same 
''relation to the Kanets of Bangdhal that the Sepis, Badis, and H^lis 
" (also classed as second-class Gaddis) do to the first-class Gaddis." 
So that it would appear that Dagis are more common in Kdngra 
proper, and Kolis to the east of the valley ; and that the latter are 
outcast while the former claim kinship with the Kanet. {Kdngra 
Settlement Eeport, ^ 67 , -pp. 6b aT:\d t)2 ; 113 shows that in Kullii at 
least the Dagi is not a caste). Hali is the name given in Chamba 
to D^gi f*!" Chandl; and the H^lis are a low caste, much above 
the Dumna and perhaps a little above the Chamar, who do all sorts 
of menial work and are very largely employed in tlie fields. They 
will not intermarry with the Chamdr. See also Koli. 

The late Mr. A. Anderson, however, wrote as to the identity of Dagi 
and Chanel : — " In Kullu proper there are no Chand,ls, that is, there are 
none who on being asked to what caste they belong will answer that 
they are Chanals ; but they will describe themselves as Dagi-Chana,ls 
or Koli-Chan^ls, and men of the same families as these Ddgi-Chanals 
or Koli-Chanals will as often merely describe themselves as D^gis or 
Kolis. In Kullu Dagi, Koli, and Chanal mean very nearly the same 
thing, but the word Koli is more common in Sard.j and Chanal is 



Dahd^Dahha, 219 

scarcely used at all in KuUu ; but Cliandils are, I believe, numerous 
in Mandi, and in the K^ngra valley. A Dagi who had been out of 
the Kullu valley, told me he would call himself a Ddgi in KuUu, a 
Chand,! in Kangra, and a Koli in Pldch or Saraj, otherwise these local 
castes would not admit him or eat with him. Again aud afain 
the same man lias called himself a Dagi and also a Koli. If a Kanet 
wishes to be respectful to one of this low caste he will call him a Koli 
if angry with him a Ddgi. A Chanal of Mandi State will not 
intermarry with a Kullu Udgi. In some places as in Mandli kothi, 
Kanets smoke with D&gia, but this is not common in Kullu, though 
the exclusiveness has arisen only within the last few years, as casto 
distinctions became gradually more defined .... A Chamd,r in Saraj will 
call himself a Dtlgi, and men calling themselves Kolis sai'l they would 
eat and drink with him. They said he was a Chamdr merely because 
he made shoes, or worked in leather. Most Ditgis in Kullu proper 
will not eat with Cbamars, but in some places they will. It depends 
on what has been the custom of the families."

Dahar, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in MuUftn. In Bahflwalpur they 
hold an important position. Their descent is traced from Raja Rawan, 
ruler of Mirpnr Mathila, near Ghot-ki, who wts conveited to Isldm by 
Sayyid JhIjII and was by him named Amir-nd-Djlhr, or " Ruler of the 
Age." Once rulers of part of Sindh, the Dilhr power decreased in the 
time of the Langfih supremacv, anrl in Akbar's time they were address- 
ed merely as Zaminddrs, but the Nd,hars conceded many privileo-es 
to them and these were maintained by the Ditudpotr.4s on their rise to 
power. The Ddhrs are closely connected with the Gihlni-Makhdums 
of Uch, to whom they have, it is said, given eighteen daugrhters in 
marriage from time to time. (For further details see the Bahdwalmir 
Gazetteer.) 

Dahar, a Jat clan (asricultural) found in Multdn. 

Dahawa, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Dahba, a Muhammadan ZiX tribe found in Gujrdt. It claims Janjua Rajput 
origin and descent from one Khoga, a servant of Akbar who gave him 
a robe of honour and a gray {dahh) horse — v^ hence its name. 



220 Dahima — Dahiyd. 

DahimAj a group of Brahmans, found in Hiss^r. 

Dahiya — (1) A J&\ tribe found on the north-eastern border of the S^uipla 
and the adjoining portion of the Sonepat tahsils of Eohtak and Delhi. 
They claim to be descended from Dalila, the only son of a Chauhdn 
Rdjput natned M^nik Rai, by a Dhankir Jdt woman. This is probably 
the Manik Rai (Jhaulian who founded Hansi. Another account makes 
their ancestor Dhadhij, son of Haria Harpdl^ son of Prithi Raja.* 
Another traiHtion derives the name Dahiyd/ from Dadhr^rd, a village 
in Hissdr, which it thus makes tlie starting place [nikds) of the tribe. 
The Dahiyd, is one of the 36 royal tribes of Rdjputs, whose original 
home was about the confluence of the Sutlej with the Indus. They 
are possibly the Dahiae of Alexander. 

(2) A faction, opposed to the Ahuldna, said to be named after the 
Dahiyd Jats. These two factions are found in Karddl, as well asin Delhi 
and R 'htak. The Ahulaua faction is headed l)y the Ghatwdl or Malak 
Jats, whose head-quai'ters are Dher-ka-Ahiildna in Gohdna, and who 
were, owing to tlieir successful oppo>*ition to the Rajputs, the accepted 
heads of the Jats in these parts. Some one of the emperors called 
them in to assist him in coercing the Mandahar Kajputs, and thus the 
old enmity was strengthened. The Dahiya Jats, growing powerful, 
became jealous of the supremacy of the Ghatwals and joined the 
Mandahdrs against them. Thus the country side was diviHed into two 
factions; the Gujars and Tagas of the tract, the Jaglan Ja,ts of thapa 
Naultha, and the Latmar Jd,ts of Rolitak joining the Dahiyas, and the 
Huda Jats of Rohtak, and most of the Jats of the tract except the 
Jdglans, joining the Ahulanas. In the Mutiny, disturbances took place 
in the Rohtak District between these two factions, and the Mandahdrs 
of the Nardak ravaged the Ahulanas in the south of the tract. The 
Dahiya is also called the Jat, and occasionally th-e Mandahar faction. 
The Jdts and Rajputs seem, independently of these divisions, to 
consider each other, triUally speaking, as natural enemies. This 
division runs right throui^h Sonepat and more faintly through Delhi 
tahsil, and is so firmly rooted iu the popular mind that Muhammadans 
even class themselves wiih one or the other parly. Tlius the Muham- 
madan Giijars of Pdnohi Gdjran call themselves Dahiyas and so do 
all the neighbouring villages. 

* Jn Delhi the legend is that Haria Harp4l, being defeated in battle by the king of Delhi 
took refuge in a lonely forest which from the number of its trees he called Ban auta — now 
corrupted into Barauta-in Rohtak. There he ruled and his son Uhaclhij after him. Dhadhfj 
one day in hunting chanced upon a certain pond or tank near PogLhaU in the same district 
•where the Jat women had come together to get their drinking-water Just then a man 
came out of the village leading ■■> buffalo-calf with a rope to the pond to give it water. The 
animal either from fright or frolic bounded away from the hand of its owner, and he gave 
chase but, in vain. Neighbours joined in the pursuit, which was nevertheless unsuccessful, 
till the animal in its headlong flight came across the path of a Jatni going along with .-wo 
gharrti^ of vvaier on her head She quietly put out her foot on the rope which was trailing 
along the ground and stood firm under the strain which the impetus of the fugitive gave. 
The calf was caught, and Dhadhfj looking on with admiration, became enamou.ed of the 
stalwart comeliness of its captor. Such a wife, he said must needs bear a strong race of 
sons to her husband, and that husband, notwithstanding the fact of her already being 
married he forthwith detenuined to be himsnlf. »y a mixture ^-.f cajolery, threats and 
gift-making he obtained his desire— and the Jatni married the Kshalri prince By her 
ht- had three sons — 'I'eja Snhja, and Jaisa. Dhadhij gave his name to the Dahiyas. and 
his children spread over the neiyhi'Ouring tracts, dividing the country between them— 
Tejrt's descendants live in Kohtak ; Sahja's partly in Rohtak and partly in 13 villages 
of Delhi ; while Jaisa's descendants live in Rohtak and in Iti villages in Delhi.

The Ahuldna tradition traces their origin to RdjputAn.^. Their 
ancestor was coming Delhi-wards with his brothers, Mom and Som, in 
search of a livelihood. They quarrelled on the road and had a deadly 
fight on the banks of the Ghdtd, naddi. Mom and Som, who were on 
one side, killed their kinsman and cmne over to Dellii to the king there 
wlio received them vvith favour and gave them lands : to Som the tract 
aciosH the Ganges wht^re his descendants now live as Rajputs. M6ra was 
sent to Rohtak, and he is now represented by the Ja^s there as well 
as in Hdnsi and Jind. The Rohtak party had their head-quarters at 
Ahulana in that district, and thence on account of internal quarrels 
they spread themselves in different directions, some coming into the

Darvesh — Ddtye. 223 

Darvesh. — Darveah means one who beps from door to door (tiar "door"). 
But the Darvesh of our Census returns are a peculiar class found mainly 
in Batala and Pathaukot and in Amritsar and Kapurthala. They culti- 
vate a little land, play musical instruments, br'y, make ropes, go to a 
house where there has been a death and chant the praises of the 
deceased, hang about mosques, and so forth. They are hardly ascetics, 
yet ihe small number of women seem to show that they have not yet 
formed into a Sf'parate cnste, and are still recruited from outside. 
Elsewhere, e. g. in Gujrat, they are poor scholars who seek instruction in 
mosques and live on alms or by bogging from door to door, resembling 
the tdlib-ul-ilm of the frontier. Sometimes they are employed as bdngis 
at mosques, or in other minor posts. 

Darvesh Kbel. — The Utmanzai and Ahmadzai clans (descendants of Mus^ 
Darvesh) of the Wazir Fa^hans [q. v.). 

Darzi. — Hindi syn. suji, a purely occu [national term, there being no Darzi 
caste in the proper acceptation of the word, though there is a Darzi 
guild in every town. The greater number of Darzis belong perhaps 
to the Dhobi and Chhimba castes, more especially to the latter; but 
men of all castes follow the trade, which is that of a tailor or sempster. 
The Darzis are generally returned as Hindu in the east and Musalman 
in the west. 

Das(a) — (a) Sanskrit ddsd, a mariner ; according to the Purdn, begotten by 
a Sudra on a Kshatriya. The Sdstrd and Tdntrd give a differenc origin 
(Colebrooke's Essays, p. 274) ; (6) Dds, the appellation common to Sudrds. 
cf. Karan. 

Dasa, fr. das, * ten,' as opposed to Bisa, fr. bis, ' twenty ' : half-caste, as 
opposed to one of pure descent — see under Bdnia. In Gurgaon the 
term is applied to a group, which is practically a distinct caste, of 
Tagas who have adopted the custom of widow remarriage, and so lost 
8ta,tus, though they are of pure Taga blood : Punjab Ctistoninry Law, 
Zi, p. 132. 

Dashal, fr. Dashwal, * of the plains,' is a group of Rajputs found in 
the Simla Hills. To it belong the chiefs of Ghund, Theog, Madh^n 
and Darkoti, four baronies feudatory to Keonthal State. It is 
asserted tha*; the Dash^ls once ranked as Kanets, wearing no sacred 
thread and performing no orthodox funeral rites ; and a fifth Dashd 
sept is still only of Kanet status. This latter sept gives its name to 
Dashauli, a village in Puuar iiargana of Keonthal. 

Dashti, once a servile tribe of the Baloch, now found scattered in 
small numbers through Deras Ghdzi and Ismail Kh^n and Muzaffargarh. 
Possibly, as Dames suggests, from one of the numerous dashts or table- 
lands, found throughout the country. 

JPaspal, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multan, 

Dasti, Dasbti (from dasht, ' wilderness '). — A Baloch tribe of impure de- 
scent. See under Baloch. 

Da-tono-kar-po, DaoNQRU-KARU : See Chdhzang. 

Datyi, a Labana clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 



224 The Ddudpotras, 

Daitdpotra.— The sept to which belon^s'J'the ruling family of Bahawalpur. 
It claims to be Abbdssi* and is practically confined to Babdwalpur and 
the neighbouring portions of Multdn, part of which was once included 
in that State. 

The Dd.udpotra septa trace their descent from Muhammad Khdn II, 
Abb^si, loth in descent from Ddud Khd,n I. Muhammad Khdn II had 
three sons : — 

(1) Firoz or Piruj Khdn, (2) A'rib (or Arab) Khdn, ancestor of the 
Arbd,ni sept, and (3) fsab Kh&n, ancestor of the Isbd,ni or HiBbd,ni sept. 

The descendants of Piruj Khd.n are known as Pirjanis, Firozdnis or 
Pir Pirjcluis and to this sept belongs the family of the Naw^bs of 
Bahawalpur. A sub-sept of the Pirjinis is called Shamd,ni, from Shah 
Muhammad Khdn. 

The Arbdnis have five sub-septs : Mus^ni, Ruknd,ni or Rukrd-ni, 
Rahm^ni, Jarabrdni and Bhinbr^ni, all descended from eponyms (Musd. 
KH^n, etc.). The Miasd,ni have an offshoot called Kandd,ni. The 
Isbdnis have no sub-septs. 

A large number of sub-septs also claim to be Dd,U(lpotra though they 
are not descended from Muhammad Khd;n II. Thus the Achr^nis claim 
descent from Achar, a son of Kehr. Kehr was brother to the wife of 
Channi Khdn, father of Ddud Khda I, and founded the Kehrd,ni sept, 
which has seven main branches : — 

Achrdni. 

Haldni. 

Bakhshdni."^ 

Jamdni. I 

Mundh^ni. }■ These five are knownf collectively as Panj-pdre. 

Marufdni. I 

Tayyibani. J 
A number of other septs also claim to be D^udpotra, but their claims 
are often obscure, disputed or clearly untenable. Such are the Nohani, 
Zoraia, Kardni (who claim to be Kehrdnis), Ronjha or Ranuhja (a sept 
of the Sammas), and Chandr^ni (who intermarry with the Arbd,nis and 
therefore are presumed to be Arbdnis). The Wisr4ni,t Muldni, 
Thumra,§ Widani, K^lra, Jhiinri, Bhanbhani, Hakrd and Kat-bal|| are 
spurious Ddudpotras. 

* For the origin of this title see the Bahdioalpur Gazetteer. 

\ .'pare, is said to mean ' -fold,' but c/. the Panj-pare among the Path4ns, also the 
Panj-pao of Multan. 

t The Arbani and Isbani Diudpotras do not recognise the Wisranis. The former declare 
that four families of the Abra {q. v.) tribe migrated from Wlsarwah in Sindh in the time 
of Nawab Muhammad Bahawal Khan II. The Abras gave one daughter in marriage 
to Balawal Khan, Pirj4ni, a second to an Arbani family, and a third to an Isbini, 
and asked their sons-in-law to admit them among the Daiidpotras, so that they might 
be entitled to all the privileges which the Daiidpotras enjoyed. This was granted and they 
were called Wisrani Daudpotras (from Wiaharwah). 

§ The story goes that once Muhammad Bahawal Khan III happened to see one Nuria 
Kharola with his head shaved. A shaven head being generally looked down upon, the 
Naw4b remarked in Sindhi (which he always spoke), ho disso thora, ' look at that bald 
head,' and so they were nick-named Thumra. They are really Kharolas (converted sweepers) 

by caste. , . , . 

II Originally Jits of low status (there is still a sept of Mohanas which is known by 
this name). They give their daughters in marriage to any tribe while the Da-fidpotras 
are particularly strict in forming alllancea. 



Ddiidzai — Ddwari 225 

For a full account of the Dd,udpotra septs, whose modern develop- 
ments illustrate the formation of a tribe by descent, aflSliation and 
fiction, reference must be made to the Bahdwalfur Gazetteer. 
Daudzai.— The Pathan tribe which occupies the left bank of the Kabul river as 
far down as its junction with the Bara. Like theMohmand, the Ddudzai 
are descended from Daulatvdr, son of Ghorai, the progenitor of the 
Ghoria Khel. Ddud had three sons, Mandkai, RJtimur, and Yusuf, 
from whom are descended the main seciions of the tribe. Mandkai 
had three sons. Husain, Nekai, and Balo, of whom only the first ia 
represented in Ppshdwar. Nekai fled into Hindijst^n, while Bale's few 
descendants live in parts of Tirah. Kalid-i-Afdidm, pp. 167, 168. 179. 
182. A. N., p. i., iii. ff i , i 

Daul, a J^t clan (agricultural) found in Amrifcsar. 

Dadla, an Arain clan (agricultural) found iu Montgomery. 

Daulat Khel. — One of the four great tribes of the Lohani Pa^h^ns''^ which 
about the bpginni)ig of the 17th century drove the Marwats and Mid,n 
Khel out of Tank. Their principal clan was the Katti Khel ; and under 
their chief, Katal Khd,n, the Daulat Khel ruled Tank in Dera Ismail 
Kbdn, and were numerous and powerful about the middle of the 18th 
century. They accompanied the Durrdni into Hindustd,n, and brought 
back mu?h wealth. But since that time the Bhitanni and other tribes 
have encroached, and they are now small and feeble. The Naw^b of 
Tdnk, the principal ^rtfjircZar of the District, is a Katti Khel. Raverty 
described them as ildtsov nomads dwelling to the north of the Sulaiman 
Range from Daraban town on the east to the borders of Gha/mi on the 
west, along the banks of the Gomal, each clan under fhe nominal rule 
of its own malik. Though their principal wealth consisted in flocks 
and herds they were engaged in trade, importing horses from Persia 
and majitha into Hindustan, and taking back with them piece-goods 
and other merchandise for sale in Kabul and Kandahd,r. They used to 
pay ushr or tithe to the dynasty at Kdbul, but were not liable to 
furnish troops. 

Dauleke, a Kharral clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 
Daura, a messenger : cf. Baldhar, 
Dauri, see Djiwari. 

Dautannj, Dotanni, aPathdn clan, numbering some 700 fighting men, which 
inhabits the Wilno valley and the country between the Waziri hills 
and the Gumal. Their lands are comparatively fertile, growing rice 
and cereals. They are on good terms with the Wazirs, and are well- 
to-do, carrying on a profitable trade with Bokhara. They brino- down 
postinft, chakmas, and charras. They have three kirris in ^British 
territory, near Katmalana and in the Kahiri ildqa. About a third of 
them are kafila folk and have no kirris. They own about 3,500 camels. 
They leave their flocks behind in the hills. They come and go aloncr 
with the Midn Khels, though forming separate caravans. 

Dawari. — Living on the fertile alluvium of the Tochi valley in Nor- 
thern Waziristan, the Ddwari s or Dauris have no necessity to culti- 

* Really only a clan of the Mimu Khel, tho Daulat Khel practically absorbed that tribo 
and gave its own name to it.

vate very strenuously or to migrate. Hence they are lacking in 
military spirit,* unenterprising and home-staying, and a Dawari,^ even 
when outlawed, will not remain away from the valley for more than 
a couple of years. 

Their descent is thus given : —

There are also two disconnected sections, Malakh and Amzoni. The 
Idak sub-section also does not claim descent from either of the main 
branches. The Malakh are a mixed division, including the Muhammad 
Khel, Idak Khel, Pai Khel, Dihgans, Land Boya and Ghazlamai. 
The latter sept includes three or four Sayyid houses which claim 
descent from t)angar Sahib. The Dihgans are quite a distinct sept, 
cnniing from Afghanis td,n. The origin of the Malakh is the common 
Afghan story of a foundling. Some Durrauis abandoned a boy in a 
box, and as Dangar Pir found him he brought him up, calling him 
Malakh because he was good-looking. 

The Amzoni comprise the following septs : — Chiton, Umarzai, Kurvi 
Kalla, Raghzi Kalla, Urmur Kail a, Ahmad Khel, Ali Khel, Fath Khel, 
Bai Khel, Khatti Kalla, Kharri Kalla and Aghzan Kalla. 

Amzon, the ancestor of these septs, is said to have been a Shammai 
Khostwd,l who mixed with the Dawaris. But the Fath Khel and Bal 
Khel are known to be Wazirs, and the Urmur Kalla are by origin 
Urmurs of Kdniguram. 

The Darpa Khel consist of Darpa Khels, Panakzai and Khozi, and of 
these tht) Panakzais are Momit Khel Dd^waris while the #Khozis are 
Akhunds. As regards Darpa Khel himself it is said that he was a 
Khostwal, but others say that he was a Dum of Tanis. 

The Idak sub-section is composed of three different septs, 
Taritas, Madira, and Malle Khels, who agreed to settle in one village 
on the Id day, whence the village was named Idak. The Malli Khel 
are Turis, the Taritas are Kharotis, while the Madiras are Katti Khels. 

The Tsori are stated to bie Khattaks. Of the Hassu Khel, the Shinki 
Khel are the offspring of a baby found near the Shinki Kotal or pass. 
The Mosakkis are said to be Bangash Haidar Khels. Urmuz and 

* But to this rule the Malakh form an exception, being much like the Wazirs, pastoral, 
migratory and not keeping their women secluded. 



Ddwari' customs. 227 

Shammarare descendants of Tir who was an Isakhel, but another story 
is that he came from the Wurdak country. All the rest of tho septs 
artj Dilwaris proper. 

Personal appearance. — The use of the spade in cultivating the stiff 
soil of the valley has made the Dawaii a very broad-shouldered, 
muscular man, not very tall, with thick legs and arms, heavy in gait 
and slow in his movements. 

Personal habits. — The vices of the Dt4waris are sodomy and chmras- 
smoking. The latter habit is said to be on the increase. The Ddwaris 
are by repute the laziest and dirtiest of all the Wazirist^n tribes. Cut 
off from the outside world, they had no inducement to cultivate more 
land than would ensure a supply of grain till the next harvest and 
their habit of greasing their clothes with ghi makes them filthy to a 
degree. There are no professional washermen in the valley. 

The Ddwaris used to be famous for their hospitality, which took the 
form of wasliing a guest's hands, spattering his clothes with ghi, and 
scattering the blood of a goat or sheep ostentatiously on the outer walls 
of the house as a sign that guests were being entertained. They were 
also steadfast supporters of their clients' or hamsdyas' riiJ:hts and true 
to their engagements. They are now said to bo losing these qualities. 

Ornaments. — Dawari men used to dye the right eye with black anti- 
mony and the left with red, colouring half their cheeks also in the samo 
way.* The men (but not the women) used also to wear coins sewn on 
the breast of their cloaks as is commonly done by Ghilzai women. 

Medicine.— The only treatment in vogue is the common Path^n one 
of killing a sheep, the flesh of which is given to the poor, and wrapping 
the patient in tho skin. This is the remedy for every disease and even 
for a wound. Its efficicy is enhanced by tho prayers recited by a 
mullah, who also used sometimes to give amulets to, or sometimes 
merely breathe on, the sick man. 

Cultivation. — Owing to the heavy nature of the soil the plough is not 
used, all cultivation being dono by the im, a spade with a long handle. 
Wheat, barloy, maize and inferior rice with, in a few villages, millet 
and 7nung are sown. Fruit-trees are i^rown only near the villages and 
trees and cultivation used to be confined to the area commanded by the 
firearms possessed by each village. 

Crafts-— The Dawaris practise the weaving of coarse cloth, rude 
carpentry and blacksmith's work, carpenters being the only artizans 
known. These are employed to make doors for the houses, which are 
mere huts, built by the people themselves. 

/SociaZ organization. —The Dawaris, as is usual among the southern 
Pathdn tribes, are intensely democratic. The maliks or headmen havo 
little influence unless they liave a strong following among their own 
relations. The D.1,waris are fanatical and l)igoted, and much under the 
influence of m?<Z^a/is who exercise a powerful weapon in tho right to 
exclude a man from the religious congregation and other ceremonies. 

Marriage Customs.— As among the Wazirs, the Diiwari wedding 
customs are much the same as among other Pathan tribes. When the

228 Ddwari marriage. 

parents are agreed that their son and daughter, respectively, are suited 
and shall be married, a day is fixed and the bridegroom's kinsmen go 
to the bride's guardian's house taking with them sheep, rice and 
Rs. 80 Kabuli with which to feast the bride's relatives and friends. 
The marriage contract is then ratified, the two young people are 
formally betrothed, and the price to be paid by the bridegroom for the 
bride is fixed. The bride's guardians may ask any price they like, as 
there is no fixed scale of prices in Ddwar, and unless the guardians are 
amenable and remit a portion of the money demanded, the sum demanded 
by them for the girl must be paid. The price thus paid is taken by the 
girl's guardian, who is of course her father, if alive — if noc her brother, 
and if she has no brother, then by the relation who is by custom her 
wdris.* The guardian, however, sometimes gives a portion of the price 
to the girl to fit herself out with ornaments, etc. Some few years ago a 
determined eifort was made by Vdemaliks and mullahs of Lower Dawar 
to have the price of girls in Dawar fixed at Rs. 200 for a virgin and 
Rs. 100 for a widow. This they did because they thought that many 
D^waris were prevented from marrying owing to the high prices de- 
manded by guardians, which sometimes ran up to Rs. 1,000 and more, 
and showed a tendency to increase rather than decrease. The majority 
of the malihs were in favour of the proposal, and as a test case the 
mullahs attempted last year to enforce the new custom on the occasion 
of the marriage of the sister of the chief malik of Tappi. Public 
opinion, however, was too strong for the reformers and a serious riot 
was only prevented by the intervention of the authorities. The usual 
reference to the Political Officer on the subject was, of course, met 
with the reply that, although he was glad to hear of the proposal, yet 
he could not and would not interfere m what was a purely domestic 
question for the Ddwaris themselves to settle. The subject was then 
allowed to drop and now, as before, everyone can put what fancy 
prices they like on their girls. The husband has no claim on the 
girl until this ceremony (known locally as lasniwai or clasping of hands) 
has been performed. 

The next ceremony is that]of nihah which is the consummation of 
the marriage. 

In Dawar and Waziristan boys and girls are betrothed at the ages 
of 8 and 6 respectively, and the mairiage is consummated at their 
majority. Should the husband die after the lasuiwai aud before the 
nikah, the girl becomes the property of his heirs, and one of them can 
either marry her or they can give her in marriage elsewhere, provided 
that she is given to a member of the same tribe and village and that 
the parents consent. If the parents do not consent, then they can 
buy the girl back again by returning all the money received for 
her, and are then free to marry her to whom they please. Simi- 
larly a widow is married by one of the deceased's heirs, or they 
may arrange a marriage for her elsewhere. She must, however, 
be supported by them until she marries again, otherwise she is 
free to marry as she chooses, and they are not entitled to exact money 



* No money ie given to the mother of the girl, except when she is a widow and has 
been turned out by her late Lusband's heirs, and has alone borne the cost of the 
girl's upbringing. 



Custom in Ddwdr. 229 

for her. As a rule the bride and bridegroom are much of an age, but 
occasionally here as elsewhere some aged David takes his Abit^hag to 
his bosom. These are not as a rule happy marriages. 'J'he expenses of 
a wedding in Waziribtdn are fairly heavy. A wealthy man will spend 
HS much as Ks. 1,500 or evi-n ];s. 2,000 Ktibuli. An ordinary well-to-do 
man spends some Rs. 500 and a poor one Rs. 200 K^buli. There 
are no restrictions on intermarriage between Dawaris and Wazirs. 
They intermarry freely, and the majority of the bigger D^war malikti 
have a Wazir wife, and the Wazir maliks living in D^war have 
generally at least one Ddwari wife. As a rule Dawaris do not give 
their daughters to thu.se living far away, which is probably due mostly 
to the fact that those living far off do not come and ask for them, but 
content themselves with something nearer home. The Mullah 
Powindah who lives at Kamjuram bas a Ddwari wife of the village of 
Idak, but this is an exception, and probably due to the fact that be- 
fore our occupation and iiis rise to power, be used to live during the 
six months of ihe cold season in Idak. There is no law or custom 
regarding marriage. 

Inheritance. — The ordinary Muhammadan laws hold good in Ddwar 
with regard to inheritance. 

Customary Law in Da war. 
General. — With regard lo oflences against the human body, the 
general principle of the customary penal law in Dawar may be said 
lo be that ot " an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." For murder 
the penalty is d^ath; for bodily injury, bodily injury of a similar 
nature. Nevertheless the Ddwari, though like every other Pathan, has 
his price, whereby his wounoed body or side may be salved ; and for 
most offences a fixed sum is laid down by paying which the offender 
may satisfy the wrath of the party offended. The amount actually 
paid, however, depends largely on the strength and influence of the 
oppo ing parties, the weaker usually having to go to the wall, being 
mercilessly fleeced if the offending party, and having to be content 
with little or uothmg if offended. As a general rule, for purposes of 
calculating C( mpensation a woman is considered as equal to half a 
man, and a Hindu is equal to a woman. Children over two years 
old are considered men or women, according to sex, for purposes 
of assessing compensation. Customary law in Ddwar only takes 
cognisance of the actual deed accomplished and not the intention 
of the offender; for instance, there -is no such thing in Ddwar, 
as attempted murder. If the man is merely wounded in the attempt 
compensatioa is only paid for the hurt actually caused. Again there 
is no such thing as letting a man oft' because he killed , another 
man accidentally. Accident or no accident, the man is dead and the 
penalty must be paid either in cash or kind. The right of self-defence 
is recognised, but in no case does it extend to the killing or perma- 
nent maiming of the person against whom it is exercised, not even if 
he be attempting to commit murder. Should he be Ijilled compensation 
must be paid to his kins, and if pennnnently maimed to himself. 
Revenge is, if possible, taken on the actual offender {badiddr) whde he 
lives. But after his death his brother inherits the feud and after him 
the murderer'a other heirs. If he leave no such relatives, his section is 



2 30 Criminal Law in Dawar. 

responsible, if the injured party belongs to another section. If the 
offendod party kill a relation of the actual hadiddr, while he is still alive, 
Hs. 100 must be paid as componsafcioa. If the offender and his brothers 
die without revenge having been taken, and the inheritance falls to a 
relation, tliat relation can, if he wishes to escape the feud, renounce the 
heritage with the feud attached to it. 

The tendency among the D^waris as among the Wazirs is to exact the 
blood penalty, but if a man is afraid, he can get the village elders and 
go and kill a sheep before the house of the offended party (a cere- 
mony known as nanowali and have the compensation assessed and 
the case settled in that way. 

Murder. — In Ddwar, as far as the consequences of the deed are 
concerned, there is no difference between murder and the accidental 
killing of a man or woman. The penalty is the same in either case. 
The punishment is death at the hands of the murdered man's relations, 
or if they cannot inflict it themselves, at the hands of assassins hired 
by them. 

A murder can, however, be compounded on the intervention of the 
village jVrgra by the payment of a sum varying from Rs. 1,000 to 
Rs. 1,200 in cash. In some cases a woman is given in marriage to a 
relative of the murdered man by the murderer, in which case the price 
of the woman is agreed upon between the parties 'and deducted from 
the amount of compensation to be paid. If both of the parties do not 
compound the offence willingly, but one is forced to do so by the 
other, or both are forced to do so by the village or tribal jirga, then 
compensation is only paid in cash. The amount of compensation paid 
for a woman is in all cases half that of a man, and the amount paid 
for the murder of a Hindu is the same as that for a woman. There are 
four exceptions to the law that the death or hurt of a man or woman 
must be avenged by the relations, either by taking a life or by taking 
money in compensation. The exceptions are — 

[i) If a man is accidentally killed or hurt in a nandasa (the name 
given to the local dance at the Id) : unless it can be prov- 
ed that the man who killed the other had a feud or any 
grudge against the deceased. 
[ii) If any one be accidentally hurt or killed in the stone-throwing 
which sometimes accompanies a wedding : provided always 
that there is no grudge or feud. 

{ii')) At a tent-pegging match if a rider warn the bystanders that 
his horse is unmanageable, no claim lies against him if 
any one is injured. 

[iv] If a man cutting wood from a tree warn people sitting under 
the tree, he is not responsible for any accident that may 
occur from falling branches. 

If a person is injured by a runaway horse or other animal, the animal 
is usually given in compensation. The burden of proof of any injury 
being accidental is on the party who inflicts it. A council of elders is 
summoned at his expense, and if he can satisfy them that it really was 
an accident, they assess the compensation as they think fit. All feuds 
are suspended while the parties are out with a tribal lashkar or chigha.

Under the custom the punishment for a hurt is a hurt of similar 
nature to that inflicted, i. e., for the loss of a limb 
the loss of that limb; for a wound, a similar wound ;

fixed by which nearly every form of hurt can be compensated, 
scale is as follows : — 

For the permanent total disablement of an arm or a leg, Rs. 500. 
If the disablement be not quite total then the compensation is Rs. 250, 
and if it bo only slight Rs. 120.

a man) tlie woman alone can be killed and the man's foot cut off, and 
if the man is killed half the compensation for his murder must be 
paid. This is the invariable rule in the Malakh ildqa. 

For rape the man may be killed, and for an assault • with intent to 
outrage a woman's modesty he may be killed and half compensation 
paid, or his foot may be cut off. For house trespass in order to 
commit adultery the man's nose or ear may be cut off, and if the hus- 
band suspects his wife of being a consenting party, he may kill her. 

The penalty for elopement or abduction is death or Rs. 1,000. Should 
a woman go wrong and become a bad character the husband may cut 
off her nose and divorce her. Should she then marry again he is 
entitled 'to no compensation. 

Offences against property. — The punishments for burglary, robbery 
and theft are all much the same. The amount stolen, with compensa- 
tion for the damage done and the expenses of the suit are recovered, 
plus a village fine of Rs. 40 to Rs. 200^ according to the offender's 
means. If no damage is done and no property stolen, only the village 
fine is recovered. 

Arson. — In cases of arson the risker is referred to the village jirga 
which, if the offence is pioved, realises a village fine of from Rs. 100 
to Rs. 200. Compensation is also realised and paid to the offended 
party.t Should loss of life result from the fire, the pen&lty for murder 
who perishes in the flames, is exacted in addition, for every person. 

Cutting of crops. — Compensation for the damage done is paid, as well 
as a fine of Rs. 5 if. the offence is committed by night, and Rs. 2 
or Rs. 3 if the offence is committed by day. 

Dawi, a tribe of Ghorgasht Path^ns, descended from Dd,wai, son of Dd,nai, 
and so akin to the Kakar, Naghar and Payni, The Dawi live in the 
tract held by the last nam^d, occupying Sanger or Sang-Mandali, and 
the Zarghun Darra or ^ green valley.' Dd^wai had two sons, Domarah 
and Homarah and adopted three more, viz., KhAvardai, Zamar and 
Samar, according to_ the most authentic account, but other traditions 
omit the two last-named. The story goes that Dawai espoused the 
widow of a Sayyid of Khujand, and adopted her son by him. His 
name was Hasan, but in his youth he was notorious as a robber {ghal). 
He repented, however, of his misdeeds and became the disciple of a 
saint of Multan, roarried a Pathan wife and had four sous, Musa, Ali, 
Sikandar and Balil, whose descendants are known as Hasani or Khundi 
{lit. protected), a corruption probably of Khujandi. The Hasani, being 
of Sayvid blood dwell among other tribes as their spiritual guide, and 
Shaikh Hasan Dawi,t one of the most famous of them, attached himself 
to the Shaikh-nl-Islam Baha-ul-Haqq-wa-ud-Din Zakaria§ of Mnltd,n, 
and was buried at a spot between Tul and Sambar. His tomb is still a 
place of pilgrimage and tales of his power of thought-reading are 
still told. Another Dawi saint was Shaikh Neknam, and a third

(2). A tribe of Jdts which is practically confined to the Sidlko^ 
district where they regard Sankatra as one of their ancestors and have a 
highly revered spot dedicated to him, in tho town of that name, in 
tahsil Zafarwal. They claim a very ancient origin, but not Rajput. 
Their ancestor is said to be Mahdj, who came from " the Saki jungle " in 
Hindustcin. Of his five sons, Soh^l, Kom, Dewal, Aulakh and Deo, the two 
latter gave their names to two Jdt tribes, while the other branches dis- 
persed over (xujr^nwdld, and Jhang. But another story refers them to Raj^ 
Jagdeo, a Surajbansi Hdjput. They have the same marriage ceremony 
as the Sahi, and also use the goat's blood in a similar manner in honour 
of their ancestors, and have several very peculiar customs. They will 
not intermarry with the Md.n Jd,ts, with whom they have some ancestral 
connection. Also found in Amritsar.

Dhamra — Dhan. 235 

Dhamra, an agricultural clan found in Shahpur. 

Dhanak, a caste, essentially of Hindustan and not of tlio Punjab proper, 
and confined to the south-east of the Province. Wilson derives the 
names from the Sansk. dhanashka, bowman, but the Dh^naks of the 
Punjab are not hunters and only differ from the Chuhras in that they 
will not remove nightsoil, though they will do general scavenging. In 
villages they do a great deal of weaving also. The Chuhras are said to 
look down on them, but thev are apparently on an equality, as ncitlier 
will eat the leavings of the other though eaoh will eat the leavings 
of all other tribes except Sdnsis, not excluding even Khatiks. 
There are, practically speaking, no Sikh or Mussahnfln Dhdnaks, 
and their creed vvould appear to be that of the Chuhras The only 
considerable tribe the Dhanaks have returned is Ldl Guru, another 
name for Ld,l Beg, the sweeper Guru. But they are said to burn their 
dead. They marry by phera and no Brahman will officiate. 'I'hey also 
appear to be closely aihed to tiie Pasis."^ See Lillbegi. 

Dhanda, a small clan of Jats, found in Jind, Their jathera is Swdmi 
Sundar D<is, at whose samddh milk is offered on the 12th sudi every 
month : beestings also are offered, and, at weddings, a lamp is lighted 
there. 

Dha^jdsahar, a JiCt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Phaijtqe, an Arain clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Dhanial, a tribe of Rfljput status which belongs to the group of hill tribes 
of the Salt-range Tract. It is from them that the Dhani country in the 
Chakwal tahsil of Jhelum takes its name ; and there appears still to be 
a colony of them in those parts, though they are now chietly found in 
the lower western hills of the Murree ranore, being separated from the 
Satti by the Ketwal. They claim to be descended from Ali, son-in-law 
of the Prophet. They are a fine martial sot of men and furnish many 
recruits for the army, but were always a turbulent set, and most of the 
serious crime of the surrounding country used to be ascribed to them. 
Many of them are of J^t status. 

Dhanjon, an Arilin clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. Also a Kamboh 
clan in that District and in Montgomery. In the latter it is both Hindn 
and Muhammadan. 

Dhankae, a Jat tribe of the same stock as the Rdthi. They are almost 
confined to Jhajjar tahsil in Rohtak, and arc perhaps nothing more 
than a local clau of the Ratlii tribe.

236 Dhdriwdl'-Dhaunchah. 

Dhakiwal. — The Dh^riwdl, Dhdni- or Dh^liwal, (or, in Karndl, Phor) Jdts, for 
the name is spelt in all three ways, are said to be Bhatti Rajputs, and 
to take their name from their place of origin Dhar^nagar. They say that 
Akbar married the daugliter* of their chief, Mihr Mitha.t They are 
found chieBy on the Upper Sutlej and in the fertile district to the west, 
their head-quarters being the north-western corner of the Mdlwa, or 
Ludhidna, Ferozepur, and the adjoining parts of Pati^la. Mr. Brandreth 
describes them as splendid cultivators, and the most peaceful and con- 
tented portion of the population of the tract. Akbar conferred the 
title of Mi^n on Mihr Mitha and gave him 120 villages round Dhaula 
Kd,ngarJ in jdgir. The Dhdriwd,l have undoubtedly been settled in 
that part from an early period, and the south-east angle of the Moga 
tahsil is still called the Dhdliwal tappa. Mitha's descendants are still 
called Miiin, but they are said not to have been converted to Islam 
though for several generations their leaders bore distinctly Muham- 
madan names. However this may be Mihr Mitha is now their sidh 
with a shrine at Lallawala in Patiala, and on the 2nd eudi of each 
month sweetened- bread and milk are offered to it. In Sidlkot, however, 
their sidh is called Bhoi and his seat is said to be at Janer§ Fatta. 

The Dhdriwdl are divided into two groups, Udhi or Odi and Moni 
or Muni (who alone are said to be followers of Mihr Mitha in Gujrdn- 
wala) . 

Dhaekhan, a synonym of Tarkh^n {q.i\) throughout the South-Wesfc Punjab. 
In Jhang they are all Muhammadans and have Awd,n, Bharmi, Bhat-ti, 
Dhddhi, Gilotar, Jaujuh^n, Kari, Khokhar, Sahdrar, S4hte and Sid,l 
septs. The latter when the first tonsure of a child is performed, cook 2| 
hhasaria or cakes, each containing I5 sers of wheat-flour, and of these 
the eldest of the family eats one, the second is given in alms and the 
third (^) is eaten by the girls of the family. 

Dhaeuera, a group, practically a sub-caste, of Brahmans found in Grurgaon, 
who have become out-castes because they adopted the custom of widow 
remarriage.il The name may be derived from (i/iare^, a concubine, or 
dharewa, marriage of a widow. They are Gaurs. 

pSAsf, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Dhatjl, an agricultural clan found in Shahpur, and, as Muhammadan Jiis, 
in Montgomery.

Dhillon, Dhillhon. — The phillon* is one of the largest and most widely dis- 
tributed Jiit tribes in the Punjab, especially in the Sikh Districts. 
Their head-quarters would appear to be Gujranwd,la and Amritsar ; but 
they are found in largo numbers along the whole course of the Sutlei 
from Ferozepur upwards, and under the hills to the east of those two 
Districts. The numbers returned for the Delhi District are curiously 
large, and it is doubtful whether they really refer to the same tribe. 
Like the Gord,ya they claim to be Saroha Rajputs by origin, and to 
have come from Sirsa. If this bo true they have probably moved up 
the Sutlej, and then spread along westwards under the hills. But 
another story makes them descendants of a Surajbansi Rajput named 
Lu who lived at Khdrmor in the Miilwa, and held some office at the 
Delhi court. They are said to be divided into three great sections, the 
Bdj, S^j and Siinda. 

Another pedigree is assigned them in Amritsar. It makes Iju (Loh 
Sain) son of Raja Karn, thus :—

left Hastindpur and settled in Wangar near Bhatinda, where his 
descendants lived for 10 generations. Karn is said to have a temple at 
Amb on the Ganges, where he is worshipped on the Chet chaudas. In 
Sidlkot the Dhillu jathera is Ddud Shdh, and he is revered at weddings. 
The Bhangi misl of the Sikhs was founded by a Dhillon, Sirdar 
Ganda Singh. In Amritsar the Dhillon do not marry with the Bal 
because once a mirdsi of the Dhillons was in difficulties in a Bal village, 
and they refused to help him, go the Dhillons of the Manjha do not even 
drink water from a Bal's hands; nor will the mwdsis oi the Dhillon 
intermarry with those of the Bal. In Ludhiana at Dhillon village there 
is a shrine of the trihal jathera, who is called Bdbaji. Gur is offered to 
him at weddings and he is worshipped at the Diwali, Brahmans taking 
the offerings. 
Dhindsa, a Jdt tribe, which would appear to be confined to Ambd.la, Ludhiana 
and the adjoining portion of Patiala. They claim to be descended from 
Saroha Rajputs. In Jind their Sidh is Bdbd Harndm Dd,s, aBairdgiof 
the 17th century, whose shrine is at Khari^l in Karnal. Offerings are 
made to it at weddings. In Sialkot the Dhindsa also revere a sati's tomb. 

Dhing, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

Dhinwar, Dhimar. — The word Dhinwar is undoubtedly a variant of Jhinwae,* 
while the term Dhimar is a corruption of it, with possibly, iu the Punjab, 
a punning allusion to the custom described below. The Dhinwar is 
confined in the Punjab to the tracts round Delhi, where the word is also 
applied to any person of dark complexion. The Dhinwars are divided 
into two groups, one of which makes baskets and carries jydlkis, works 
ferries and is in fact a Kahae. Many of this group are fishermen or 
boatmen, and call themselves Mallahs, while some are Bharbhunjds. 
The other group is so criminal in its tendencies that it was once pro- 
posed to proclaim the Dhinwars a criminal tribe, but violent crime is rare 
among them and though they wander all over the Punjab, disguised as 
musicians, beggiiig, pilfering and even committing burglary or theft on 
a large scale, many of them are cultivators and some even own land. 
The Dhinwars of Gurgd,on once used to marry a girl to Bhaironji, and 
she was expected to die within the year. The Dliimars do not own the 
Dhinwars as the latter are notorious thieves. No Hindu of good caste 
will take water from a Dhinwar's hands, though he will accept it from 
a Dhimar. (The latter caste appears to be the equivalent of the Jhinwar 
in the United and Central Provinces). See also under Jhinwar. 

Dhiemalia, the second oldest sect of Sikhs. The Dhirmalia owe their origin 
to Dhirmal,t who refused to acknowledge Guru Har Rai, his younger 
/<" hrother , as the Guru. The sect has an important station at Chak Rdm 
Das in Shdhpur, where the Bhais descended from Dhirmal own the 
village lands. They have a considerable following, chiefly of Khatris 
and Aroras. Bdba Bar Bhag Singh, another member of the family, has 
. a shrine at Mairi, near Arab in Hoshidrpur. The sect has no special 
tenents differentiating it from the Nanakpanthis.

Dholv-^Dhotar. ' 239 

Dhobi, perhaps the most clearly defined and the one most nearly approaching 
a true caste of all the Menial and Artisan castes. He is found undor 
that name throughout the Punjab, but in the Derajat and tlie Multiln 
Division he is undistinguishable from the Charhoa. He ia the washer- 
man of the country, but with washing he generally combines, especially 
in the centre and west of the Province, tlie craft of calico-printing, 
and undoubtedly in these parts the Dhobi and Chhimba castes overlap. 
The Dhobi is a true village menial in the sense that he reci^ves a fixed 
share of the produce in return for washing the clothes of the villajjes 
where he performs that office. But he occupies this position only 
among the higher castes of landowners, as among the Jdts and castes 
of similar standing the women generally wash the clothes of the family. 
The Dhobi is, therefore, to be found in largest number in the towns. 
His social position is very low, for his occupation is considered impure ; 
and he alone of the tribes which are not outcast will imitate the Kumhdr 
in keeping and using a donkey. He stands below the N^i, but perhaps 
above the Kumhar. He often takes to working as a Darzi or tailor, 
and in Peshiiwar dhohi simply means a dyer (rangrez). He is most 
often a Musalmitn. His title is barita or khalifa, the latf er being the 
title of the heads of his guild. 

The Dhobi sections appear to be few. They include : — 

1. Agrai. 5. Kamhoh. 9. Rikhari. 

2. Akthra. 6. Khohhar. 10 Liirli. 

3. Bhalam. 7. Koh^ns. 11. Lippal. 

4. Bhatfi. 8. Mahraal. 

(Those italicised are also Chili m Via a?icZ Charhoa po^v, Nos 1, 3 and 
9 being also Charhoa gots). The Hindu Dhobis in Kapurthala say they 
are immigrants from the United Provinces and preserve four of their 
original seven gro^s, fi^., Magia, Miirwair, Balwar and Kanaujia, while 
the Muhammadan sections are said to be Galanjar, Mohar, Role, Sano-ari, 
Saukhar and Satal- 

Dhoda, an agricultural clan found in Sluthpur. 

Dhodi Bhandaet, KeATAR, Namonana and Waib, fonr Rajpijt septs (agricul- 
tural) found in Mult^n. 

Dhoqri, the ironsmiths, miners and charcoal-burners of the Barmaur wizcirat 
of Chamba State, where, when holding land as tenants, they are, like 
other low-castes, termed jhumridhc, lit. ' family servants'. In Kullii 
territory all say the term dhogri is applied to any Dt'iglu or K'oli who 
takes to iron-smelting : cj. Chhazanq for the Dhongru Kd,ru in Spiti. 

The name is probably connected \y ith dhaukni, etc., 'bellows,' and 
dhauna, ' to blow the bellows. ' 

Dhol, a tribe of Jats, found in Kapurthala, whither it migrated from the 

East, beyond the Jumna, after settling in Amritsar : see also Dhaul. 
Dbori, a J^t clan (agricultural) found in Shdhpur. 

Dhot, a Kamboh clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar and Montgomery — 
in the latter both Hindu and Muhammadan. 

Dhotar, a Jdt tribe, almost entirely confined to Guji'iinwala. They are mostly 
Hindus, and claim to be descended from a Solar Rajput who emigrated 
from Hindustan or, according to another story, from Grhazni, sjmo 20 
generations back. 



240 Dhudhi — Dhund. 

Dhudhi, Dhudbi, a tribe of Muhammadans found in Pdkpattan tabsil, 
Montgoraery district, and akin to the Raths, In this district it is 
clasbed as Rcijput, 3 At, Ardin, and in Sh^hpur as Ji\,. In Montgomery 
the Dhudhi Hutidna raok as Rajputs. 

Dhudhial, an agricultural clan found in Sh^hpur. 

Dhudhi, a small clan of Panwdr Rajputs found with their kinsmen the Rathor 
scattered alonor the Sutlej and Chendb. Their original seat is said to 
have been in the Mails! tahsil of Multd,n, where they are mentioned as 
early as the first half of the 14th century. When the Delhi empire was 
breaking up they spread along the rivers. One of them, Hdji Sher Mu- 
hamra-id, was a saint whose shrine in Multdn is still renowned. They 
are said to be " fair agriculturists and respectable members of society." 

Dhddi, a Jilt tribe found in tahsil Mailsi, district Multdn, and formerly, in 
the 13th century, established in the extreme east of it. 

Dhul, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur and, as Riijputs, in Montgomery. 

Dhul, one of the principal clans of the Jats in Karnal, with its head- quarters 
at Pai. 

Dhdllu Bhatti, a Rajput clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Dhund, the Dhund with the Satti, and Ketwal, occupy nearly the whole of 
the Murree and Hazd-ra Hills on the right bank of the Jhelum in the 
Hazdra and Rawalpindi districts. Of the three the Dhund are the most 
northern, being found in the Abbottlbdd tahsil of Hazdra and in the 
northern tracts of Rawalpindi, while below them come the Satti. 
Andwd,l appears to be one of the Dhund clans. They claim to be 
descendants of Abbas, the paternal uncle of the Prophet ; but another 
tradition is that their ancestor Takht Khd,n came with Taimur to Delhi 
where he settled ; and that his descendant Zorab Khan went to Kahuta 
^ in the time of Shdh Jahan, and begat the ancestors of the Jadwd,l, 

/^ Dhund, Sarrd,ra, and Tandoli tribes. His son Khal^ra or Kulu Rai was 

sent to Kashmir, and married a Kashmiri woman from whom the Dhund 
are sprung, and also a Ketwd,l woman. From another illegitimate son of 
his the Satti, who are the bitter enemies of the Dhund, are said to have 
sprung ; but this the Satti deny and claim descent from no less a person 
than Nausherwan. These traditions are of course absurd. Kulu Rai is 
■ a Hindu name, and one tradition makes him brought up by a Brahman. 
Colonel Wace wrote of the Dhund and Karrdl : '^ Thirty years ago their 
acquaintance with the Muhammadan faith was still slight, and though 
they now know more of it, and are more careful to observe it, relics of 
their Hindu faith are still observable in their social habits." This much 
appears certain that the Dhund, Satti, Bib, Ohibh, and many others, 
are all of Hindu origin, all originally occupants of the hills on this part 
of the Jhelum, and all probably more or less connected. Among the 
Punwdr clans mentioned by Tod, and supposed by him to be extinct, are 
the Dhoonda, Soruteah, Bheeba, Dhund, Jeebra, and Dhoonta ; and it 
is not impossible that ttiese tribes may be Punwd,r clans. The history of 
these tribes is given at pages 592 j(y^ of Sir Lepei Griffin's Punjab Chiefs. 
They were almost exterminated by the Sikhs in 1837. Colonel Cracroft 
considered the Dhund and Satti of Rawalpindi to be a ' treacherous, 
feeble, and dangerous population,' and rendered especially dangerous by 
their close connection with the Karral and Dhund of Hazdra. He says

Dhunia — Dllazak. 241 

that the Satti are a finer and more vigorous race and less inconstant 
and volatile than thp Dhund, whoso traditional oneniios they are. Sir 
Lepel GriflRn wrote that the Dhund " have ever been a lawless untract- 
able race, but their coiiratre is not equal to their disposition to do evil." 
On the other hand, Major Wace described both the Dhund and Karral as 
"attached to their homes and fields, which they cultivate simply and 
industriously. For the rest their character is crafry and cowardly." 
Both tribes broke into open rebellion in 1857, and the Dhund were 
severely chastised in Rfiwalpindi, but left unpunished in Hazdra. 
Mr, E. B. Steedmnn said : " The hillmen of Rawalpindi are not of very 
fine physique. They have a good deal of pride of race, but, are rather 
squalid in appearance. The rank and file are poor, holding but little 
land and depending cliiofly on their cattle for a livelihood. They have 
a great dislike to leaving the hills, especially in the hot weather, when 
they go up as high as they can, and descend into the valleys during the 
cold weather. They stand high in the social scale." In Haz^ra the 
local tradition makes two of the two main Dhund clans, Chandial and 
Ratnic'll, descendants of two Rdjput chiefs who were descended from Gahi, 
ruler of a tract round Delhi. To this day they refuse to eat with other 
Muharamadans or even to allow them to touch their cooking vessels. 
At weddings they retain the Hindu custom, whereby the hardt or pro- 
cession spends 2 or 3 days at the house of the bride's fattier, and various 
other Hindu social observances. They rarely marry outside the tnbe^ 
but polygamy is fairly common among them.'^' Mr. H. D. Watson 
describes them as physically rather a firie racf, and intelligent, but 
factious and unscrupulous.

DiHADRAE, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 
DiLAZAK, an important Pathan tribe. 

The Dilazak were the first Afghdn tribe to enter the Peshiiwar valley, 
and the Akhund, Darweza, avers that they came first into Nangrahdrt 

* E. Molloy, in P. N. Q. II, § 281. 

t The "Dilazaks first fcntcred Nangrahar from the west or south-west and, prior to Ti'raur's 
invasion, settled in the Peshawar valley, allying themselves with the Shalmim's. In Bihar's 
time and under Akbar they held Walasau and the eastern part of Bajaur. They assigned the 
Doilba to the Yusufzais and Mandars and they in turn to the Gagi'unis, but the latter were defeat- 
ed by the Uibzaks Upon this tlie Khashis, headed by Malik Ahina 1. the Mandar chief, attacked 
the Dilazaks and drove them out of all their territorios north of the Kibul river. The Khalfls 
and Mohmands then induced Kamran to attack the Dilazaks and he expelled them from Pesha- 
war and all their possessions west of the Indus (c 1533-4). Subsequently (c. 1d4'.)-S()) Khan 
Kaju. Malik Ahmad's successor, formed a great confederation of Khashi tribes and defeated the 
Ghwaria Khel, headed by the Khah'ls, at shaikh i'apiir in 154.i-5o. Kh.in Kaju's power may be 
gauged from the fact that he had at one time a force of 150,000 men under his command and his 
authority was acknowledged from Nangrahar to the Marigalla pass, and from Upper Swit to 
Pindi and Kalabagh. Adam Khi'm Gakhar is said to have been his feudatory. Three or four 
j'ears later in 1552 Hum^yim reached Peshawar, which fortress he found in ruins, and appointed 
Sikandar Khan the Cossack (Qa/ak) its governor. Soon after 1552 Khan Kaju marched on 
Bagram and there invested isikandar, but havins; no artillery or other firearms was pompelled 
to raise the siege. Khan Kaju's Mulla or chief priest and minister was Shaikh Mali who divided 
the conquered lands among the Khe^shis. 



242 Diiiddr'^Dirmdn. 

from the west and passed on eastward before the time of Timur. Enter- 
ing the vale of Peshdwar they formed an alliance with the Shalmfinis, 
who were then bubject to the Sultd,n of Sw^t, and subdued or expelled, 
exterminated or absorbed the other tribes which held the valley. Thus 
they occupied the eastern part of Bdjaur, and their territory extended 
from the Jinde riv^r to the K^Mpani and the hills of Swat. The 
Shalmanis held the Hashtna»ar tract, but all the lands from Bd,jaur 
to the Indus north of the K^bul and south of it as far as the Afridi 
hills, were Dilazak territory .vhen the Khashi Pathdns appeared on 
the scene. That branch of the Afg'hd,n ration had been expelled from 
their seats near Kabul by Mirza (Jlugh Beg, B^bar's uncle, they ap- 
plied for aid to the Dilaz^ks and were by them assigned the Shabkadr 
Do-dbah or tract between the two rivers. 

Accordingly the Yusufzai ard Mandar tribes of the Khashis settled 
in the Do-^bah, and some under the Mandar chief, Mir .Jamd,l Amanzai, 
spread towards Ambar and Diinishkol, while many Mandars and some 
of the Yusufzais pushed on into Bdjaur. Then they came into collision 
with the Umr Khel Dilazdks, who held the Chanddwal valley, and defeated 
them with the loss of their chief, Malik Haibu. The Yusufzai, Mfindar 
and Khalil'^ then divided Bajaur among themselves, but soon fell out 
and in the end the Khalils were crushed in a battle fought in the Hindu- 
raj valley. The Khalils never again obtained a footing in Bajaur. 

Meanwhile the Gagidnis had attempted to set a footing in Bdjaur 
but failed and besought Malik Ahmad Mandar for aid. He assigned 
the ])o-abah to them, but they soon found cause of quarrel with the 
Dilazaks, and even with the Yusufzais and Mandars also. In 1519 
the Gagidnis brought Bd,bar into the Hashtnagar tract, ostensibly 
against the Dilazdks, with whom the Yusufzai and Mandars left them 
to fight it out. In the result the Dilazak completely overthrew the 
Gagi.anis. The former were elated at their victory, and thus aroused 
the jealousy of Malik Ahmad, who formed a great Khashi confederacy, 
including various vassals of the Yusufzai and Mandar. In a great 
battle fought in the Guzar Kud, between Katlang and Shahbdzgarhi, 
the Dilazaks were defeated with great loss, but in the pursuit Ahmad's 
son Khdn Kaju chivalrously allowed the Dilazdk women to escape across 
the Indus. He subsequently received the hand of the daughter of 
the Dilazdk chief, and the political downfall of the Dilazak was 
thereby sealed. As good subjects of Bdbar they were obnoxious to 
Mirza Kamrd,n, and this doubtless accounts for the failure of all their 
attempts to retrieve their position, since they were only finally overcome 
after much severe fighting. In alliance with Kamr^n the Khalils 
sought to despoil the Dilazaks of their remaining lands, and by 1534 
they had obtained possession of the country from Dhdka to Attock, 
together with the Khyber and Karappa passes.

Diwdna'^Dod. 248 

DiwANA. — The third oldest sect of the Sikhs. To Guru Har Rai, or perhaps 
to Guru Rdm Dds, must ho ascribed the origin of the DiwJlna Siidhs 
or " Mad Saints," a name they owe chiefly to their addiction to ex- 
cessive consumption of hemp drugs. Founded by Bahl and Uaria 
with the Guru's permission the order is but loosely organised, and is 
recruited mainly from the Jdts and Ohamars. Its members are for 
the most part non-celibate. Outwardly those S^dhs keep the hair 
uncut and wear a necklace of shells, with a peacock's feather in the 
pagri. They fellow the Adi Grantli and repeat the true name.'^ Sikh 
history relates that one of the sect who attempted forcible access to Guru 
Govind Singh was cut down by a sentry, whereupon Ghudda, their 
spiritual guide, sent 50 men of the sect to assassinate him. But of these 
48 turned back, and only two proceeded to the Guru, without weapons, 
and playing on a sarangi ; and instead of killing him they sang to him. 
He gave them a square rupee as a memorial. (Macauliffo : ISikh Re- 
ligion, V, p. 218). They are mainly returned from Kdngra district. 

DiwAR, a family of Oadhioks, settled at Dalwd-l in Jhelum, 

DoD, a Rajput tribe found in Hoshidrpur, The Dods are almost entirely 
con6ned to the Bit tract in the Siwdliks, their head being the Rdna 
of Mdnaswd.lt. The Dods are Jadav or Chandr-bansi by origin. Tra- 
dition avers that they once fought an enemy H times as numerous as 
themselves, and so became called Deorha, whence Dod. The clan once 
ruled in Orissa, whence Deo Chand fought his "way to Delhi, defeated 
its rulers, the Turs (Tunwdrs), and then conquered Jaijon : — 

Orisa sc charhiya Raja Deo Chand Barydhan Tika ae. 

Tur Raja auliydn jo thaJce fauj rachae, 

Tur chhadde nathhejo mil baithe hai, 

Dod Qarh Muktesar men jo mile chare thdon, — 

' Raja Deo Chand marched from Orissa. The Tiir Raja collected a large army in order to 
meet him, but fled before him. The Dods occupied Garh Muktesar and the places round it.' 

Thus Deo Chand came to Jaijon and ruled the Dodba, His descend- 
ant Jai Chand gave his name to Jaijon. The Dod Rdjd was, however, 
defeated by a Rdjd of Jaswdn, and his four sons separated, one taking 
Jaijon, the second Kungrat, the third Mdnaswal Garhi and the fourth 
Saroa. Jaijon and Saroa were subsequently lost to the Dods, and after 
their defeat by Jaswdn they sank to the status of rdnas, losing that of 
Rajas. Of the 22 villages dependent on Kungrat, none pay talukddrl 
to the rdna who is a mere co-proprietor in Kungrat, as the family lost 
its position during the Sikh rule. The Rana of Manaswdl, however, 
maintained his position under the Sikhs and holds most of the 22 
Mdnaswal villages (Bit = 22) in jdgir, his brothers holding the rest. 

Another account runs thus : — 

Four leaders of the tribe migrated from Udaipur to Garh Mandil, I.IOU years ago, and 
thence to Garh Muktasar. Thence Jodh Chand seized Minaswal, expelling Hira, the Mahton 
leader, whose tribe held the tract, 40 generations a^o. Rana Chacho Chand, the 19th Rana, 
was attacked by the Katoch ruler, but his brother Tilok feingh (Tillo) defeated him at 
Mahiidpur in Una, and Tillo's shrine at Bhawani is reveninced to this day. In Samb»t 1741 
Rana Jog Chand repelled a Jaswal invasion. R4na Bakhl Chand annexed Bhalan, with 12 
dependent villages, in Una. His successor, Ratn Chand, repelled a Jaswal army under 

* Maclagan, § 101. The Diw4na Sadhs appear to be a sect of the Milwa with head- 
quarters at Pi'r-pind in

Bhagwan Singli Sonkhla who was killed, and in his memory a sbrinc at Kharali was 
erected. A treaty now dciined the Jaswal and Dod territories. Under Mian'Gulab Singh/ 
regent during /\chal Chand's minority, Nadir Shah is said to have visited the tract and 
ordered a massacre of the Kasali people, but the Rima obtained from him a grant of Bathri, 
then a Jaswi 1 villaiic. Rai.a Jhagar Chand, however, espoused the Jaswals' cause, when 
they Wire aUncJitd by Sansar Chand of Kangja in U04 A. D., and repulsed him. On 
Ranjit Singh's invasion of the Blanaswal plateau, the Rana was confirmed in his possessions, 
subject to a contingent of 15 horse. The rule of inheritance was primogeniture, mitigated by 
a .system of lopping olT villages as fiefs for younger sons, many of whose descendants still 
hold villages, thus reducing the size of the estate. 

The Dods are also found aa a Muhammadan J at clan (agricultural) 
in Montgomery. 

DoDAi^ once an important Baloch tribe, but not now found under that 
name. Its most important representatives are the Mirr^ni of Deras 
Ghdzi and Ismdil Khd,n, and Jhang, and the most important clans 
of the Gurcli^ni. 

DoDHi, a Gaddi milkman, in Gujrdt. 

DoDi, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

JDoGAR, fern. Dogarni. — The Dogars of the Punjab are found in the upper 
valley of the Sutle] and Be^s above the lower border of the Lahore 
district, and have also spread westwards along the foot of the hills into 
Si^lkot. There are also considerable colonies of them in Hissar and 
Karnd,l. 'I'he Dogars of Ferozepur-, where they hold the riverside 
almost exclusively from 20 miles below to 20 miles above the head- 
quarters of that District, were thus described by Mr. Brandreth : — 

" In my account of the Ferozepur ildqa I have already alluded to the 

Dogars, who are supposed to be converted Chauhd,ii^' Kajputs from the 

neighbourhood of Delhi. They migrated first to the neighbourhood of 

P^k Patfan, whence they spread gradually along the banks of the 

JSutlej, and entered the Ferozepur district about 100 years ago. The 

Ferozepur Dogars are all descended from a common ancestor named 

Bahlol, but they are called Mahu DogarSj from Mahu the grandfather 

of Bahlol. Bahlol had three sonsjt Bambu, Langar and Sammu. The 

Dogars of Ferozepur and Mull^nwd,la are the descendants of Bambu ; 

those of Khai the descendants of Langar ; the descendants of Sammu 

live in the Kasiir territory. There are many other sub- castes of the 

Dogars in other districts Hlong the banks of the cSutlej, as the Parchats, 

the Topuras, the Chopuras, etc. The Chopura Dogars occupy Mamdot.J 

Ferozepur Dogars consider themselves superior in rank and descent to 

* Francis (.Ferosepwr Gazefteer, 1888-9, pp. 15-16) gives a full account of the Dogar 
history in that District and on p. 56 he says that the Dogar claim to be Punwar, as well as 
Chauhau, and are probably a section of the great Ehatti trite and clotely allied to the 
^'AIrAL. The Manj traditions say that the Dogars are descended from Lumra (? fox) who, 
like Naipal, was cne of Rana Blmti's :i4 sons. They thrust aside the Watnis to the west 
and the Naip^ls to the east, aud piokably subdued the Machhis, Malhihs imd other inferior 
tribes, assuming the position of social superiors rather than that of actual cultivators, and 
affecting the title of Sirdar. 

t Francis ^Ferczcpur Gazetieer, p. f<6) gives a different account He fays that Mahu had 
two sons Sahlol (whose descendants live on the Kasur side of the Sutlej) and Bahlol, 
From Bahlol sprang four branches, Khamii, Phaimaki, Ullaki and Kandarki. The Phaimaki 
hold Khai and Avill not give daughters to other branches which they consider inferior. 
Infanticide was formerly common amongst them. 

i Francis says the sections mostly locateu in Mamdot are the Mattar, Chluni, Rupal, 
Pbandi and Kbamma, as wOil as the Chopra, 



The pogars. 245 

tho other sub-castts. They arc very particular to whom they give 
their daughters in marriage though they take wives from all the other 
families. At one time infanticide is said to have prevailed nmong 
them, but 1 do not think there is much trace of it at the present day. 
" Sir Henry Lawrence, who knew the Dogars well, writes of them 

, that 'they are tall, handsome, and sinewy, and wre remarkable for 
liaving, almost without exception, large acquiline no.•^esJ they are 
fanciful and violent, and tenacious of v/hat they consider their rights, 
though susceptible to kindness, and not wanting in courage ; they 
appear to have been always troublesome subjects, and too fond of their 
own free mode of life to willingly take service as soldiers. The Jewish 
face which is found among the J)ogais, and in which they resemble 
the Afghans, is very remarkable, and makes it probable that there is 
very little Cliauh^n blood ia their veins, notwithstanding the fondness 
with which they attempt to trace their connection with that ancient 
family of Kajputs. Like the Gujars and Naipdls they are great thieves, 
and prefer pasturing cattle to cultivating. Their favourite crime is 
cattle-stealing. There are, however, some respectable persons among 
them, especially in the Ferozepur ildqa. It is only within the last few 
years that the principal Dogars have begun to wear any covering for 
the head ; formerly the whole population, as is the case with the poorer 
classes still, wore their long hair over their shoulders without any 
covering either of sheet or turban. Notwithstanding tho difference of 
physsiognomy, however, the Dogars preserve evident traces of some 
connection v/ith the Hindus in most of their family customs, in 
which they resemble the Hindus much more than the orthodox 

Muhammadans.^' 

Mr. Purser wrote that they are divided into two tribes, one of which 
claims to bo Chauhan and the other Punwar Rdjputs, and he noted 
their alleged advent from Fak Pattan, but not their previous migra- 
tion from Delhi. If they ever did move from Delhi to the Montgomery 
district, it can hardly have been since the Ghaggar ceased to fertilize 
the intervening country, and the date of the migration must have been 
at least some centui-ies back ; and the Dogars of Hissar camo to those 
parts from the Punjab, probably from the Sutlej across the Sirsa 
district. Tho Dogars of Lahore and Ferdzepur are essentially a 
riverside tribe, being found only on the river banks : they bear the 
very worst reputation, and appear from the passage quoted above to 
have retained till lately .some at least of the habits of a wild tribe. 
Their origin was probably in the Sutlej valley. They appear to have 
entered the Ferozepur district about 1700 A.D., and during the next 
forty years to have possessed ihemsolves of a very consideralale portion 
of the district, while their turbulence reudoied them almost independ- 
ent of the Sikh Government. In 1808 wo recognised the Dogar 
State of Ferozepur, and took it under our protection against Kanjit 
Singh ; but it lapssed in 1835. 

The Rdjput origin of the Pogars is probably very doubtful, and is 
strenuously denied by their Ivdjpiit neighbours, though Sir Deuzil 
Ibbetson believed that Dogar, or perhaps Doghar,*^ is used in some

parts of the Provinco to denote one of mixed blood. Another derivation 
of tlie name is doghgar or milkman."^" The Dogars seem to be originally 
a pastoral rather than an agricultural tribe, and still to retain a strong 
liking for cattle, whether their own or other people's. They are often 
classed with Gujats, whom they much resemble in their habits. In 
Karndl, Lahore and Ferozepur they are notorious cattle-thieves, but 
further north tliey seem to have settled down and become peaceful 
husbandmen. They are not good cultivators. Their social standing 
seems to be about that of a low-class Rajput, but in Sirsa they rank as 
a good agricultural caste, of equal standing with the Wattus. They are 
practically all Musalmdns, but in Karndl their women still wear the 
Hindu petticoat j and in marriage the mother's got is excluded. In 
Jullundur they marry late, and are said to have marriage songs 
unintelligible to othor tribes. Some of the largest Dogar clans are 
the Mattar, China, Tagra, Mdhu and Chokra. 

According to an account obtained from Kapurthala the Dogars were 
originally settled at Lakhiwal, near which was fought a battle between 
the Man] and Bhatti Rajputs, the Dogars siding with the latter. The 
Manj were, however, victorious and expelled the Dogears from Lakhiwdl, 
but for generations no Dogar would drink from the hands of a Manj. 

The Dogar septs in Kapurthala are: — Dasal, from LakhiwS,!: founded 
Dasal which was destroyed by the Sikhs, who had been plundered by 
the Dogars in their flight from Ahmad Shah Abd^li ; Biljwa, or Ratrd., 
from Sund,ru; Ripd^l, Nainah, Mattar, Asar all from Lakhiwal. 

Other gots are the Si<^hi, Banch, Ddre, Chhane, Khame, Mabhi, M4hu, 
Daddd, Dhandi, Gug, Dher, Tote, Kohli, Fade, Sanapi, Jakhra, Katwdl, 
Chhohar, Chopri, Ghangi, Wali, Wisar, Khari, Sombar, Ilsar, Johde, 
Kotordal, Gosa^l, Saurai, Dbaurdi and Gamload. 

In Montgomery the Dogar -Khiwa, -Mahu and -Mittar rank as three 
agricultural Rajput clans. 

DoGLi. — A term applied to the offspring of a Rajput man by a Gaddi woman 
in Kdngra. Cf. Dogala, a mongi-el. (The d is soft). 

DoGBA, a term applied to any inhabitant of the Dugar fZes,t whatever his 
caste, but more especially to the Hindu Rajputs of that region. Brah- 
mans also are included in the term, as are Rathis and 'I'hakkurs (as 
Rajputs), but not Ghirths or Kanets.J 

According to Drew [Jammu and Kashmir Territories, pp. 43 et seq.). 
there are two lakes near Jammu, the Saroin Sar and Man Sar, and the 
country between them was called in Sanskrit Drigarhdesh or the 
country between the two hollows. This was corrupted into Dugar. 
Drew divides the Dogras of the Jammu hills into Brahmans, E^jputs 
(including the Midns and workiug Rajputs), Khatris, Thakars, Jats, 
Banyas and K(i;rars (petty shopkeepers), Nais, Jiurs (carriers)', Dhiy^rs 
(iron-smelters), Meghs and Dums. 

DoHLi, a drummer (player on dol) in Gujrat. 



* In Hissar the Dogars have a vague traditiou that they camefrom the hill called Dogar in 
Jammu.

Dolat—Drigs. 247 

DoLAT, DuLHAT, a claii of Jrlts found in Ndbha, Pa^idla and Ferozepore."*^ Rai 
Khanda, their ancestor, is said to have held a jagir near Delhi. His 
brothers Ragbir and Jagobir were killed in Nadir Shah's invasion, but 
he escaped and fled to Siuna Gujariwdla, a village, now in ruins, close 
to Sunam, and then the capital of a petty state. He sank to Jat status 
by marrying his brother's widows. The origin of the name Dolat is 
thus accounted for. Their ancestor's children did not live, so his wife 
made a vow at Naina Devi to visit the shrine twice for the tonsure 
ceremony of her son, if she had one. Her son was accordingly called 
Do-lat (from lat hair). 

Dolat, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

DoM, DoMB, fern, dombdni, Bal., a bard, minstrel ; see Dum. In Dera Gh,4zi 
Khdn the doms or mirdsis arc a low class of Muhammadans who used 
to keep horse-stallions and still do so in the Bozdd;r hills. 

DoMARAH, a Jd,t clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

DoMBKi, DoMKi. — Described in ballads as •' the greatest house among the 
Baloch/ and of admittedly high rank, the Domki are still called the 
Dapfar fPers. daftar) or recorders of Baloch genealogy. But owing 
to this fHct and the similarity of name some accuse them of being 
Doms, and a satirist pays : 'The Dombkis are little brothers of the 
Doms.' The name is however probably derived from Dumbak, a 
river in Persia. Their present head-quarters aie at Lahri in Kachhi. 

DoMRA, a young bard : a term of contempt, but see Dumril. 

DosALi, a small caste found in Hoshidrpur, but not east of the Sutlej.f 
Its members make dishes of leaves, often of ^awar leaves for Hindus 
to eat of. At weddings their services are in great request to make 
leaf platters, and that appears to be their priticipal occupation. They 
sew the leaves together with minute pieces of dried grass straw, 
as is done in the Simla Hills by Dumnas. The Dosdli is deemed an 
impure caste, and Rdjputs, etc., cannot drink from their hands. But 
it is deemed hifj;her than the Sarera, or the Bhanjrd, but below the Bdhti 
or Ghirth, and near the Chhimba. The Dosdli rarely or never marries 
outside his own caste. 

DoTANNi, see Dautanni. 

DoTOEN, see Thakur. 

DoYE, an Arain clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Drakhan, Bal., a carpenter- contrast dras-hk, a tree. 

Dren, see Mallah. 

Drigs, a tribe of Jdta found along the Cheiidb in Multdn. They attribute 
their origin to Kech Makrdn and were probably driven out of Sind late 
in the 15th century setthng in Bet Kech in Akbar's time. They are 
entitled Jdm. 

* But their Sidh and Pi'r is Didar Si igh, whose shrine is at Mard Khefa in Jmd. 

I Ibbetson indeed describes the Dosali as a hill caste, somewhat above the Chamar, or 
rather aa an occupational group, deriving its name from duKa, the small piece of straw 
used to pin loaves together. I'.ut the Uosalfs are also found in Amritsar where they have a 
tradition that their forebear used to carry a lantern before the emperor, whence h« was 
called Misaali. This menial task led to his excommunication, and the name was corrupted 
into Dosili. 



248 Drishah — Drugpa. 

DhisnAK, aro the most scattered of all theRALoCH tumans of Dera Ghdzi KhSn, 
many of theif villaofes lying among a Jd,t population on the bank of the 
Indu" ; and this fact renders the tnman less powerful than it shoulc? be 
from its numliers. They hold no portion of the hills, and are practically- 
confined to the Ghazi district, lying scattered about between the 
Pitok Pass on the norhh and Sori Pass on the south, The tribe 
belongs to the Rind section ; but claims descent from Hot, son of 
Jaldl Kh^n. Its sections are the Kirm^mi, Mingwani, Gulpadh, 
Sargdni, Arbdni, Jistkdni and Isanani, the chief belonging to the 
first of these. Their head-quarters are at Asni close to Rdjanpur. 
They are said to have descended into the plains after the Mazdri, or 
towards the end of the 17th century. 

Deugpa, * red-cap ' (but see below). — A Buddhist order. Like its sister order 
the NiNGMAPA, from whom they appear to be distinct, the Drugpa was 
founded about 750 a. d. by Padanisambhava, who is known iu Ld^hul as 
'Guru' or Guru Rinpoche. Padamsanibhava visited Mandi, Ganotara, 
Ldhul, Kashmir and both the Bangd,hal8, but died in Great Tibet.* One 
of his great doctrines was called Spiti Yoga, and he may have developed 
it in Spiti. A sorcerer and exorcist, he helped to decjrade the faith by the 
most debased Tantraism, but he merits admiration as a great traveller. 

The name Drugpa possibly means, according to Mr, Francke, the 
Bhutia order, the Tibetan for Bhutan being Drukyiil or Drugyiil and for 
a Bhutia 'Drugpa.' The Bhutan church is governed by a very great 
Ldma, who is ahnost a Pope in himself.t In Spiti his title is given as 
Dorji Chang, but in Ladd,kh he is known as N(g)a(k)wang Namgial. 
The Bhutan Ldma appears to rule the following religious houses in 
Western Tibet :— 

Ganphug*, 

Gesar and Sumor in the 
Daba dzong. According to 
a Spiti manepa (preacher) 
his Heu tenant in Tibet is 
known as the Gangri 
Durindzin,or Gyalshokpa J 
and his influence is widely 
spread. He is or should 
be appointed for a term of 
three years. 

In LShuI there are two distinct f-ects of the Drugpas : — 
1. The Zhung Drugpas (Middle Bhuteas) or Kargiutpa (Tantraists). 
This sect has 3 Lahula communities all connected with the parent com- 
munity at Hemis : only one Ldhula house boasts an abbot {khripa), 
[pronounced thripa] and he is appointed by the abbot of Hemis. The 
head monastery is at Dechen Choskor near Lhassa. 

* Padamsambhava was an Indian monk who became a great friend of the Tibetan emperor 
Khrising bte btsau (pron. Treshing detsam), who extended his empire from the Chinese 
frontier to Gilgit. 

t Sherring describes the curious P. ru?a administration which rules one of the most 
sacred regions of Tibet independenth , and sometimes in defiance of the Lhassa authorities ;

But the Zhun Drngpas acknowledge the suzerainty of the pope or 
Dalai Ld,raa of Bliuti1,ii, and in December 1909 the abbot of Hernia 
Skoshok Stag Tsang Has Chen passed through Kullu to attend the 
Bhuti'm Dalai Ldina's court. 

2. Hlonilrugpa, pronounced Lodrug]Da (the Southern Bhuteas). There 
are no less than ivvelvG houses of this order. All are subordinate to 
Stagna (pron, Takna) in Laddkh and that house again is subordinate to 
Bhutiln. The abbot of Stagna appoints the abbot of the ancient house 
of Guru Ghuntd,l or Gandhola which was founded by Guru Rinpoche 
himself, and the Gandhola abbot appoints the other Lahula abbots of 
the order. He sends an annual tribute of Rs. 30 to Gangri Durindzin 
through the abbot of Stagna. The Drugpas of Mhul thus keep up their 
connection with Bhutan. Orders appointing or relieving an abbot are 
supposed to be signed in Bhutan, and when the ritual dancing at 
Krashis (Tashi) Dongltse (at Kyelong) was revised a brother was bent 
to Bhutiin to learn the proper steps, instead of to the much less distant 
Drugpa monastery at Hemis in Lad^kh.* 

Like the Ningmapas the Drugpas are distinguished for their low 
moral standard and degraded superstitions which are little bettor 
than devil-worship. The brethren are allowed to marry and their 
children {huzhan or ' naked boys ') let their hair grow till they 
enter the community. 

DoBfR, a weighman, in Muzaffargarh. 

DuHLAB, an agricultural clan found in Sh^hpur. 

DuKPA, Lo-DUKPA, the Buddhist sect to which all the monks in L^hul and 
the monks of the Pin monastery in Spiti belong. Its peculiarity is that 
no vow of celibacy is required of, or observed by, its members, who 
marry and have their wives living with them in the monasteries. The 
sect wears red garments and is subject to the Dharma R^jd, of BhutJln, 
in which country it is most numerously represented. The Nyingmd is 
the sub-division of the Dukpa sect to which the monks of Pin and 
the families from which they are drawn belong. The word merely 
means * ancient,' and they appear to have no distinguishing doctrines. 
(Apparently the same as the Nyimapa sect of § 252 of Census Report, 
1881). But see Drugpa and Ningmapa from Mr. Francke's accounts 
of those orders. 

DuM, or less correctly Dom : fern. Dumni, dim. Diimnl. According to Ibbetson 
the D urn is to lie carefully distinguished from the Dom or Domrd,, the 
executioner and corpse-burner of Hindustan, who is called Dumna in the 
liills of Hoshidrpur and Kdngra. But in Chamba the Dumnsl is called 
Dum and in the Hill States about Simla he is a worker in bamboo.t 
Aocording to Ibbelson the Dum of the plains is identical with the 
MiRASi, thrt latter being the Muhamraadan, Arabic name for the Hindu 
and Indian Dum. But though the Diims may overlap the Mirdsis 



* Tt is not, however, certain that all Drugpas are subject to Bhutan. Kamsay gives a 
separate sect called Hlondukpa (Hlo meaning Bhutin) which includes the Stagna 
house. It was founded, he says, in the 1 5th century by N(g')a(k)wang Namgial : Dicty. 
of WeUern Tibet, Lahore, 1890, p. 83. Possibly there was a reformation from Bhut4n in 
the iDth century.

250 Duftf^Dumnd. 

and be in common parlance confused with them, they appear to be, in 
some parts of the Punjab at least, distinct from tliem, and the Mirdsis 
are beyond all question inextricably fused with the Bh^ts. In 
Gurgdon the Dum is said to be identical with the Kanchan, and to be 
a Minlsi who plays the tahla or camoigi for prostitutes, who are often 
Mirdsi girls. Such Dums are also culled htiarwa (pimp) or sufardai. 
Dum women fis well as men ply this trade. But another account from 
the same District says that the Dum is the mirdsi of the Mir^sis ; and 
that he gets his alms from the menial castes, such as the Jhiwar, 
Dakaut, Koli, Oliamfir, Bliangi, Juldhd, and Dhd,nak. la Lahore too 
they arc described as quite beyond the Mirdsi pale, as the true Mirdsis 
will not intermarry with them nor will prostitutes associate with them, 
though, like the Bhands,^ they sing and play for them when they dance 
or siny professionally. In fact they rank below the Chuhrd. So too 
in Ludhidna tl)ey are distinct from and lower than the Mlrasi. 

In Dera Ghdzi Khd,n the Dum or Langd, are said to be an occupa- 
tional grtmp of the MiRAsis, and to be the mird.n of the Baloch tribes. 
In other words they are identical with the Dom or Domb, whose name 
means minstrel in Balochi. 

DuMNA.— The Dumnd., called also Domra, and even Dum in Chamba, is the 
Chuhrd. of the hills proper, and is also found in large numbers in the 
sub-montane tracts of Kdngra, Hoshidrpur and Gurdd,spur. Like the 
Chuhrd of the plains he is something more than a scavenger ; but 
whereas the Chuhrd. works chiefly in graes, the Dumna adds to this 
occupation the trade of working in bamboo, a material not available 
to the Chuhrd. He makes sieves, winnowing pans, fans, matting, grass 
rope and string, and generally all the vessels, baskets, screens, furniture 
and other articles which are ordinarily made of bamboo. When he con- 
fines himself to this sort of work and gives up scavengering, he appears 
to be called Bhanjra, at any rate in the lower hills, and occasionally 
Sariiil. 'I'he Dumna appears hardly ever to become Musalmdn or Sikh, 
and is classed as Hindu, though being an outcast he is not allowed 
to draw water from wells used by the ordinary Hindu population. 

TheDumnd, is often called Dum in other parts of India, as in Chamba; 
and is regarded by Hindus as the type of uncleanness. Yet he seems 
once to have enjoyed as a separate aboriginal race some povfer and 
importance. Further information regarding him will be found in 
Sherring (I^ 400) and Elliott (I, 84). He is, Sir Deuzil Ibbetson con- 
sidered, quite distinct from the Dum-Mirdsi. 

DtJMNA, a low sweeper caste, a 'so called Bhanjrd, in the hills and in Gurdds- 
pur, Jnllundur and Hoshiarpur. They make chiks, baskets, etc., of 
bamboo and do menial service. Apparently the term is a generic one, 
including Barwalds, Batwd^ls, Daolis and Sansois. But in Lahore, where 
the Dumna is also found, he is described as distinct from the Batwdl, 
and as a Hindu who is yet not allowed to draw water from Hindu wells. 
Some of the Dumnd,s will eat from a Muhammadan's hands. Their 
clans are Kalotra, Manglu, Pargat, Drahe and Lalotra. The word is 
probably only a variant of Dum. 

* The Diain ranks below the Bhand also. The latter are skilled in hhanddr a practise of 
which the Diim is ignorant. It consists in absorbing all the water in a large bath and 
ejecting it through the ears, nostrils or mouth.

Faizullaporia, the sixth of the Sikh misls or confederacies, which was 
rccruitccl fi'om Jilts. 

Faqartadaei, a J^t clan (agricultural) fouud in Multan. 

Faqib, pi. FDQAKA, 'poor/ a mendicant (Arabic). 'I'he term faqir compre- 
hends at least two, if not three, vcrj ciifferent classes, exclusive of the 
religious orders pure and simple. Many of these are of the highest 
respectabihty ; the members are generally collected in moDasterics or 
shrines where they live quiet peaceful lives, keeping open house to 
travellers, training their neophytes', and exercising a wholesome influ- 
ence upon the people of the neighbourhood. Such are many at least 
of the Bairagis and Gosains. .Some of the orders do not keep up 
regular monasteries, but, travel about begging and visiting their 
disciples; though even here they generally have permanent head- 
quarters in some village, or at some shrine or tcmjile where one of their 
order officiates. So too the monastcrial ordeis travel about among 
their disciples and collect the offerings upon which they partly subsist. 
There is an immense number of these men whose influence is almost 
wholly for good. Some few of the orders are professedly celibate, 
though even among them the rule is seldom strictly observed; but most 
of the Hindu orders are divided into the Sanyogi and Viyogi sections 
of which the latter only takes vows of celibacy, while among the Musal- 
m^n orders celibacy is seldom even professed. Such, however, as live 
in monasteries arc generally, if not always, celibate. The professed 
ascetics are called Sadhs if Hindu, and Pirs if Musalm^n. The Hindus 
at any rate have their neophytes who are undergoing probation before 
admission into the order, and these men are called chela. But besides 
these both Hindu and Musalman ascetics have their disciples, known 
respectively as scicak and murid, and these latter belong to the order 
as much as do their spiritual guides; that is to say, a Kayath clerk 
may be a Bairagi or a Pa^han soldier a Chishti, if they have committed 
their spiritual direction respectively to a Bairagi guru and Chishti pir. 
But the Muhammadan Chishti, like the Hindu Bairagi or Gosain, may 
in time form almost a distinct caste. Many of the members of these 
orders are pious, respectable men whose influence is wholly for good. 
But this IS tar from being the case with all the orders. Many of them 
are notoriously profligate debauchcrs, who wander about the country 
seducing women, extorting alms by the threat of curses, and relying 
on their saintly character for protection. Still even these men are 
members of an order which they have deliberately entered, and have 
some right to the title which they bear. But a very large portion of 
the class who are included under the name Faqir are ignorant men of 
low caste, without any acquaintance with even the general outlines of 
the religion they ])rofess, still less with the special tenets of any parti- 
cular sect, who borrow the garb of the regular orders and wander 
about the country living on the alms of the credulous, often hardly 
knowing the names of the orc^crs to which the external signs they wear 
would show them to belong. Such men are mere beggars, not ascetics ; 
and their numbers are unfortunately large. Besides the occupations 
described above, the Faqir class generally have in their hands the

custody of petty shrines, the menial service of village temples and 
mosques, the guardianship of cemeteries, and similar semi-religious 
offices. For these services they often receive small grants of land 
from the village, by cultivating which they supplement the alms and 
offerings they receive. 

The subject of the religious orders of the Hindus is one of the greatest 
complexity ; the cross-divisions between, and the different meanings of, 
such words as Joc.i, Saniasi and Sadh are endless. See also Bharai, 
Chajjupanthi, D^dupanthi, Jogi, Saniasi, Udd,si, etc., etc.

tion that they originally cauie from lldsliuug in Swat. — Biddulph'a

Gabhal, a Muharamadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Gabir, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Gabr, or, as they call themselves Narisati,* a small tribe found in a few 
villages in Chitral. Possibly the Gabrak of Bd,bar'3 Memoin, their 
language differs onsiderably from that of the Gabare of the Indus 
valley. The Chitrdlis speak oi them as a bald race, and they certainly 
have scanty beard«. Sir G. Robertson describes them as all Musal- 
md,ns of the Sunni sect, who have a particular language of their ONvn 
and are believed to have been anciently fire-worshippers. 

The Gabr has no very .listinctivo appearance except that one 
o^'-cabionally seea a face like that of a pantomime Jew. There are one 
or two fair-visagpd, well-looking men belonging to the better class, 
who wouid compare on equal terms with the similar class in Chitral : 
they, however, are the exception, 

The remainder, both high and low, seem no better than the poor 
cultivator cla-^s )n other parts of the Mehtar's dominions, and have a 
singularly furtive and mean look and manner. The women have a 
much better appearance. They dress in loosf blue garments, which 
fall naturally into graceful folds. The head is covered with a blue 
skull-cap from which escape long plaits of hair, one over each shoulder, 
and two hanging down behind. White metal or bead neck and wrist 
ornaments contrast well with the dark blue material of their clothes. 
At a short distance these women are pleasing and picturesque. 

The Ramgul Kdfirs are also spoken of as Gabars or Gabarik, but 
they have no relationship with the Gabr. 

Gadarah, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multiin. 

GipARf, a J6t clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Gadaria, the shepherd and goatherd of Hindustan. Almost confined to the 
Jumna zone in the Punjab, the Gadaria has, even in that part of the 
Province, almost ceased to be distiuctively a shepherd, as the 
cultivating classes themselves often pasture their own flocks, and has 
become rather a blanket weaver, being indeed as often called Kambalia 
as Gadaria. The Gadaiias are Hindu almost without exception. 

Gaddi, Gadi.— (I) The Muhammadan Gaddis of Delhi, Kariidl and Ambdla

Birkot, and by the Kafirs Satrgran, Niirsnt being its Chitrali name. — The Kdfiri of the 
Hindoo-Koosh, p. 265. 

■j" There is also a Gaddi tribe among the Sainia- 



256 Ihe Bill Gaddie. 

bnt in Karnal, where they are most numerous, they have settled down 
as cultivators and own several villages, though they are poor husband- 
men. (2) The Hindu Gaddis of Chaiuba and Kdngra are billmen. 
Like the Kanets, Moos an(i other congeries of tribes they are com- 
posed of several elements. Indigenous to the Brahmaur ivizdrat of the 
Chainba State they have spread southward across the Dhaula Dhd,r into 
tlie northern part of Kdngra Proper, and they give their name to the 
Gaderan, a tract of mountainous country with ill-defined bimndaries 
lying on both sides of the Dhaula Dhsir, and their speech is called 
Gddi. 

In Chamba they number 11,507 souls, but these figures do not include 
the Brahman and RAjput sections which returii themselves under their 
caste names. The majority are Khatris. 

The Gaddfs are divided into four class s : (i) Brahman?, (u) Khatris 
and Riijputs who regularly wear the sacred thread, (iii) Thd^kurd and 
Kdthis who, as a rule, do not wear it, and {iv) ?i menial or dependant 
class, comprising Kolis, RihdraH,"^ Lnhars, Bddhis, 6ipis and Halis, 
to whom the title of Gaddi is incorrectly applied by outsiders as inhubib- 
ants of the Gaderan, though the true Gaddis do nob acknowledge them 
as Gaddis at all. 

Each class is divided into numerous gotras or exogamous sections, 
but the classes themselves are not, strictly speaking, exogamous. Thus 
the Jhunun gotar of the Khatris intermarries with (? gives daughters 
to) the Brahmans; and the Brahmans of Kukti regularly intermarry 
with the other groups. Similarly the yaneo-wearing families do not 
object to intermarriage with those which do not wear it, and are even 
said to give them daughters (menials of course excepted). t 

In brief, Gaddi society is organised on the Rajput hypergamous 
system. 

The Gaddis have traditions which ascribe their origin to immigration 
from the plains. Thus the Chauhnn Rajputs and Brahman Gaddis 
accompanied Kaja Ajia Varma to Chamba iu 850-70 A. D., while the 
Churahan, Harkhd,n, Pakhru, Chiledi, Manglu and Kundail Rajputs 
and the Khatris are said to have fled to its hills to escape Aurangzeb's 
persecutions. These traditions are not irreconcilable with the story that 
Brahmaur, the ancient Brahmapura, is the home of the Gaddis ; for 
doubtless the nucleus of their confederation had its seats in the Dhaula 
Dhdr, in which range Hindus have from time to time sought an asylum 
from war and persecution in the plains. 

The Brahman, Rdjput, Khatri, Thdkur and Rdthi sections alike 
preserve the Brahminical gob'a of their original tribe. But these 
gotras are now sub-divided into countless als or septs which are appa- 
rently also styled gotras. Thus among the Brahmans we find the Bhats 
from the Bhaitiyat wizdrat of Chamba, and Ghungaintu {ghungha, 
dumb), both als of the Kaundal gotra. The Brahman sept-names 
disclose none of those found among the Sarsut Brahmans of the Punjab 



* A small caste or group of menials, employed as navvies. See footnote on page 259 

t It is indeed stated that no distinction is now made between families which do, and those 
which do not, wear the janeo ; but in former times the Rajas used to confer the janeo on 
Kathis in return for presents and services— and so some of them wear it to this day.

plains, so completely do the Gaddi Bralimans seem to liavo become 
identified with the Gaddi S3'stem. Many of the a/6* bear obvious 
nick-names, sucli aa Cliadhu, cross-legf^ed ; * Dundu, one- hand- 
ed ;t Tanju and Tandetu, cat's-eyed ; j Bhanoretii, jquinter ; §

mother ; Sasi, one who lived with his mother-in-law. Litkar, lame; XX 
Timaretu, squinter; §§ Chupetu, reticent. 

Otlier names denote occupations not by any means Brahminical : 
Snndheta, sellei- of assafoctida {simdha) ; Palihan, sharpener ;|||| Bardan, 
archer ; ^[^1 Siihdhrdntu, once a sdli or wealthy man who became bank- 
rupt ((//tara?i<w) ; Sipainu, tenant of a Sipi menial; Kanetu, a Bdnd's

Jogi ; Lade, a trader to Ladakli ; Khuthlu, A;i<//i-seller ; Jhunnu, 
idler ; **^ Phangtain, dealer in phamb, wool. 

Totemism does not exist, unless Guarete, 'born in a </Mor or cowshed/ 
and Sunhunu, from one who had a sif?'t7iK tree in frout of his bouse, 
could be regarded as totemistic sections. 

In Kangra one got — Paunkhnu — is said to provide j)nro}iits for all the 
other Brahman Gaddis. The Brahmans in Kangra, it is said, inter- 
marry with the Jhunu got of the Gaddi Khatris.

tease; Ainlaitu, opium-cater; Dharanibar, pock-marked. In Kdngra 
the Agiisni got of Rajput Gaddia is said to be really an offshoot of the 
Jarial lliljputs. 

Among the Kliatris, no trace exists of the section-names current in 
the plains. We find occupational names : Sdhnu, shopkeeper {sdh) ; 
Fadhotaru, from one who lived on a plain {jmdar) ; Rusahri, cook ; 
Charhain, climber ; Nakletu, mimic ; Sundhu, dealer in assafcetida ; 
Bangetc, a physician who powdered zinc [hang) ; Mogu, dealer in coral ; 
Dhanchu, fr. one who lived with his flocks [dhan) ; Panjaru, wool- 
comber ; Gharati, water-miller : with two inexplicable names ; Drudhain, 
one who recovers stolen millet from mouses' holes ; and Druhru, one who 
so recovers walnuts — fr. drndh, druhri, a mouse's hole ! Other Khatri 
ah (so-called gots) in Kangra are : Bhundu, Bhakhu, Baddn, Bhatelu, 
Biluin, Bihantii, Chadlu, Chaledi, Chapetu, Clmgainu, Dagran, Galoti, 
Kord.ru, Jhuraiii, Phatu, Magletu, Rahlu, Salnu, Sundhu, Targain, 
Thakleq, Tliosaru, and Thakru. None of these names are found among 
the Khatris of the plains, as Barnes appears to have been informed. 
But just as among the Brahmans of the hills, e. g. in Chamba, we find 
the ancient gotras broken up into countless als, so too among the Gaddi 
Khatris it may well be that the old sub-divisions have been forgotten 
amono- the crowd of al names. Other als found in Chamba follow. 

Traces of totemism can hardly be said to exist in Gohaina, killer of a 
lizard {goh) ; Bersain, * one who fetched her trees for his flocks ' ; Potu, 
one who ate sheep's entrails {poia) ; Thapliag, one who ate wheat-cakes 
{thoplu) ; Sarw^n, planter of a cypress {Pers. saru !) ; Phakolu, one 
who was poor and ate phah, ' husks.' 

One or two curious names are : — Sanglu, carrier of a sacred chain 
[sangal) ; Sanjuan, maker of offerings {sanj); Mangnesu, beggar. 

Mere nicknames are Kalsain, Kaletu and Kal^ri, * black ' ; Lateti, 
lame; Phiugaletu, crippled,* Kiari,t blind; Ghusu,J boxer, Tatangru§ 
and Kachingar, dumb. 

Among the R^this the als would seem in a few cases to be really 
totemistic : Mardlotar, 'born under a mardZ tree,' the ulmus Walli' 
chiana. Sinuri, 'born while it was snowing'; Salbainu, 'born while 
locusts were at Kugti'; R^ute, 'born under a rai or silver fir*; 
Jotain, born in the Sural pass, jot. 

Mosi of the names a''e however mf^rely tiicknames, e.g., Jamuhd,n, 
cl msy (Jam) ; Tanari, deaf; Dhageta, cragsmnn ; Dapher, lazy, etc. 
Som<- ari- derived from events, e. g., Harokar, said to mean one ostra-

Ht-ligious nauies also occur : Japaintu, from jap, repetition: Faqir, 
beggar; Jogian, fiom a jogi ancestor. 

Occupational names are : Phakru, maker of combs for cleaning wool, 
Ghorn (royal) groom; Ghuletu, wrestler; Bhajretu,!] porter; Gdhri, 
Alpine grazier; Addpi, collector of blankets (fidp) in which part of the

Gaddi dress. 259 

In Ki'ingra tlio Riltlii als aro said to bo Barjati, KuMi, Ghariiti (a 
Khatri al in Cliamba), and Sakliotru. The H^jas used to confor the 
janeo on Eiithis in return for presents and services, and this is why sonio 
of them still wear it. 

Among the Thakkurs of Kdngra are tlie Barilu, Harehi, Janwi'ir, 
Marthdn and Siuri als. Other ah whose members do not wear the janeo 
(and are therefore presumably Thakkur too) are the Baghretu, Ghdrij 
Tutdri and Ugbarotu. 

The Gaddis are an interesting people^ and offer a striking contrast in 
several respects to the other inliabitants of Chamba. The costume of 
the Gaddis, both men and women, is characteristic and striking. The 
old head-dress of the men is of a peculiar shape, with a flap rodnd the 
margin, and a peak-like projectiun in the centre, said to represent the 
Kailds of Mani Mahes. 'I'he flap is tied up for ordinary wear, but let 
down over the ears and neck in time of mourning, as well as in severe 
weather. The front is often adorned witih dried flowers or beads. 
But this head-dress is falling into disuse, save on special occasions 
its jilace being taken by the pagri. On the body a pattu coat 
called chola, reaching bolow the knee, is worn. It has a deep collar, 
which hangs loose in two lappets in front, and in the sowing the 
wearer stows away various articles, such as a needle and thread, pieces 
of paper and twine. The chola is tightened round tho waist by a black 
rope worn as a waist-band. This is made of sheep's wool and is called 
dora. Above the waist-band the coat is loose, and in this receptacle 
the Gaddi carries many of his belongings. On the march a shepherd 
may have four or five lambs stowed away in his bosom, along with hig 
daily food and other articles. The logs are generally bare, but many 
wear pattu paijdmas, loose to the knees for the sake of freedom in 
walking, but fitting tight round the calf and ankle where it rests in 
numerous folds. Shoes are in common use. From the girdle hang a 
knife, a flint box and steel and a small leather bag, in which the wearer 
carries money and other small articles. The hill people are all fond of 
flowers, and in the topi or pagri may often be seen a tuft of the wild 
flowers in season, red berries, or other ornament. The chief ornament 
is the tahit, a square silver plate of varying size covered with carving 
and hung from the neck. Gaddi women wear a dress like that of the 
men, made oi pattu and called cholu. It hangs straight, like a gown, 
from the neck to the ankles, and round the waist is the woollen cord 
or dora. A cotton gown of a special pattern is now common and is 
called ghundu. It is worn in the same way as the chnlu. The head ia 
covered with a chadar, and the leys and feet aro bare. The Gaddi 
women wear special ornaments, of which the chief is the galsari, and 
sometimes a tahit, similar like the men. They also wear heavy brass 
anklets, called ghunkare which are peculiar to the Gaddi women.* Tho 
Gaddis say that they assumed tho garb of Shiva and Parvati when they 
settled in Brahmaur which they call Shiv-bhiimi or Shiva's lancl, 
but it is not their dress alone that makes them conspicuous. Tlieir 
whole bearing is characteristic, conveying an impression of sturdy in- 
dependence which is fully borne out by closer contact with them. They 
are robust of frame, and accustomed to exposure in all weathers owing

to the migratory life so many of them lead. In their manners they are 
frank and open, deferential to their superiors and yet manly and dignified. 
They delight in festive gatherings^ and are fond of singing and dancing— 
the latter in a style peculiar to themselves. Their women are pleasing 
and comely, and have the reputation of being also modest and chaste. 
The Gaddis are a semi-pastoral and semi-agricultural tiibe,and own large 
flocks of sheep and goats, which are their chief source of wealth. With 
them they go far afield, the summers being spent in the higher 
mountains of lYmgi and Ldhul ; and the winters in the low hills bor- 
dering on the plains. Tliis duty the male members of the family take 
in turn, the others remaining at homo to tend the cattle and look after 
the farm work. Many of them own land on both sides of the Dhaula 
Dhdr, and reap the winter crop in K^ngra, returning in spring to cut 
the summer crop in Brahmaur. Ou the whole they are better shep- 
herds than farmers, and perliaps for this reason they are the meet 
prosperous agricultural class in the State. The yeaily exodus to Kangra 
takes place in October and November, and the return journey in April 
and Mhj. With an appearance of candour and simplicity, the Gaddis 
have the reputation of being good at making a bargain; hence the 
saying in the hills — 

Gaddi mitr hhola, 

Denda tap to mangda chola. 

" The Gaddi is a simple friend, 

He offers his cap, and asks a coat in exchange." 
The Gaddi wedding customs merit special notice. 
In betrothal the boy's parents or guardians send their parohit to 
negotiate for a girl about whom they have information, and he brings 
back her parents' reply. If it is favourable the boy's parents send 
two or more respectable men to the girl's home to complete the bar- 
gain. Then if it is clinched, two of the boy's family go with the 
parohit to perform the ceremony. If the betrothal is dliarma puna 
this consists in the bride's father giving the parohit a bunch 
of druh grass with four copper coins or more, if they please, 
to be handed over to tho boy's father in token that the alliance 
is accepted. The -parohit hands over the driib, and the coins are 
returned to the parohit with a rupee added by the boy's father. The night 
is spent at the bride's house, and after a meal her father gives the boy's 
father 8 copper coins and these he places in a vessel as a perquisite to 
the servant who cleans it. In a betrothal by exchange [tola] the first 
observances are the same,but when ali go to finally complete the alliance a 
grindstone and sil with 3 or 5 roris of gur, supdri, hihan and roUydii^ are 
placed before the paity and then the parohit -p\Q,cea supidri, hihan and 
roliydn in the skirt of his sheet and puts them on thesi7. Before tappinfif 
them on the sil with the grindstone he receives 4 annas from the boy's 
father and mentions the names of the boy and girl whose alliance is to be 
formed, and then taps them. After this the supdri, etc., are placed in a 
vessel, with the balls of gur broken up, and distributed to those present 
after tho girl's father has taken a bit. The elder members of the girl's 
family do not take any as it would be contrary to custom. The boy's father 
puts Ko. 1-4 in this vessel and this is made over to the bride's parents

who get jewellery to that amount made for her. After this the bride 
appears before the boy's father and he gives her a rupee. The rest of 
the ceremony is exactly as described above, but in this case the coins put 
in the vessel come out of tlio boy's fatlitr's pocket. The ceremony in the 
other house is performed in exactly tlie same way, though not on the same 
day for the sake of convenience. A propitious date is not fixed, but a 
lucky day is desirable, and Tuesday, Friday and Saturday are considered 
unlucky. 

After having the date for the wedding fixed by a fctrohit tv/o men 
are sent to the girl's people with a iscr of ghi to notify them of the date, 
and if they approve ot it messengers from both sides go to the parohit 
and get him to write the lakhnotcri. For this he is jiaid 8 Chamba coins 
or 4 annas in cash, rice and some red tape [dori). At the wedding itself 
the sutnhurat rite is first performed by worshipping Ganpati, humhh * and 
the nine planets and then the avpnri (a mixture of tunneric, flour and 
oil) purified by mantras is rubbed on the boy. Three black woollen 
threads are ah^o tied round hia right wrist to protect him from the evil 
eye. lie is then taken out into the court-yard by his niOthcr, with part 
of her i-ed sheet thrown over his head, to bathe. At the bath the black 
thread is torn off and he is led back by his mother. Next he must up- 
set an earthen lid, containing burning charcoal and mustard placed at 
the entrance to the worshipping place, and this must be thrown away 
so as to remove any evil influence which he may have contracted in the 
court-yard. The j^cirolnt then ties nine red cotton threads round the 
boy's right wrist and gives him ghi and gur to taste. 'J'hose wristlets 
are called /k'fi^i^an/j. This is preceded by the ifiZ-sajidl ceremony. Again 
Ganpati, Brahma, Vishnu, Jcmnhh, diat and the nine planets are wor- 
shipped, and then a he-goat is sacrificed to the planets by the boy, its 
blood being sprinkled on the sdndori [bagar grass rope) e.nd muuj mala 
(a ring of hagar). The sdndori is then spread round the room along the 
cornice and the bridegroom made to don a white dlioti or sheet round 
liis loins, to put flour mundrat [jogis ear-rings) in his ears, sling a satchel 
over his shoulder, tie a black woollen rope round his chests and cover hia 
buttocks with an animal's skin, suspend ufanani (bow for carding wool) 
to the black rope and take u. tirnhdr stick in his riglit hand with a 
Brahminical thread tied round his right thumb. This dress is assumed so 
that he may appear a regular yogf* (ascetic). After this the presiding 
priest asks him; 'why hast thou become a ^o^i ?' His answer is 'to 
receive the Brahminical cord.' Then he is further interrogated by the 
priest as to what kind of cord he requires, i.e., one of copper, brass, silver, 
gold, or cotton, and he asks for the latter. The priest then sends him to 
bathe .'it 15adri Narain, Trilok Nath and Mani-Mahesha, and these sup- 
posed baths are taken in turn by dipping his hands and feet in, and 
pouring some water on his face from, a vessel put ready for the purpose 
in the doer-way. After these ablutions the pretended ^o^i begs, first of 
liis relations and then at the house, and they give him a piece of bread 
and promise him cattle, goats, etc.. according to their means. In conclu- 
sion the priest asks him whether he wishes to devote himself to jdtera

(worldly business) or mdtera (an ascetic life) and he invariably answers 
* to ji'afera/ and then the priest makes him take off his jogi's clothes, 
receiving 4 annas as his fee for this. The cattle, etc., which the rela- 
tions promised to the boy go to him and not to the priest. 

This over, the boy is made to sit on a wicker basket, or a sheep-skin 
bag for carrying grain (called hhalru), and a dagger is placed on the 
tnunj maid* above his head. Then the people pour oil over bis head, 
with a few blades of grass {drub], taken from a vessel containing oil 
and held by his mother's brother or in his absence by her sister. After 
this the bridegrocmi fits an arrow to the fanani (bow) and shoots it at 
the head of the dead goat which is placed over the nine planets, thereby 
pretending to slay them. The rite of tasting gur and ghi by the boy 
ends this ceremony. The bridegroom is then dressed. He wears a 
white pcigri (turhan) and kuwd, a red hidncha, and a white j)atha 
with gtdhadan suthan and ajaulf thrown over the shoulders. The 
present {suhdg-pafdri) is tlien arranged. It consists of a kharhas,"^ 
hidncheri, ghngru, § nau-dori, \\ U7igi,% chundi** kdngi, manitidr, 3 
roris of gur, dates, grapes, almonds, rice and 7 luchis, aud these are 
carried by the parohit to the bride's house, with the procession. The 
boy is then veiled with a purified veil {sehra) by his mother's brother, 
his brother's wife puts antimony on his eyes, and his sister fans him. 
After this the boy gets up and the drti is then waved thrice from right 
to left over his head by the parohit, and his mother throws three round 
cakes {luchis) on three sides of him. The drti mast be sanctified by 
mantras before being used at the door. After this the boy's father 
gives him the tawihol (present) of Re. 1, and 4 copper coins, the latter 
being the parohit's fee. The boy then gets into a doli in the court- 
yard and his mother gives him her breast to suck. The pdlki is then 
carried by four bearers to the entrance, beneath the woollen parrots call- 
ed toran, whicli the boy, his mother and the parohit worship, aud then 
the bearers present the boy with a kumhh filled with water and he puts a 
copper coin in it. The bridal procession, consisting of the male n-em- 
bers of the house and friends, dressed in their best clothes and preceded 
by tom-toms, goes to the bride's house. On arrival the boy with his 
followers is put up in a house other than the girl's, or camps out in the 
open air. The boy's father or uncle, with one or two more, then takes a 
basket full of round cakes to the bride's parents : this is called 
hatpartana. They return from the bride's house, after eating 
something and putting 4 copper coins in the plate, and rejoin the 
procession. This observance is called juth •pal. Two respectable men 
are also deputed to the bride's parohit, to settle the amount he will 
take for pei-forming the rites at the lagan, and then rejoin the camp. 
Thehoj^^ parohit then proceeds to the bride's house to deliver the 
harsuhi^'\ (bride's) dress to her. The harnchi consists of a white 
sheet {dupatta), ludncheri, ghagaru, naudori,iingi, kangi (comb), (articles

to couduct tlio bridegroom and his followers to the bride's house with 
tom-toms playing. The boy i» recoived at the eutrance by his mother- 
in-law who performs the drti ceremony over him, waving it seven times 
over his head with hei- right hand, holding her left over his turban. 
Four tnrus are taken from the boy's ri^rht to his left and thi-ee in 
the reverse direction. Threo cakes, jilacod in the plate with the 
drti are also thrown out towards the court-yard. The priest 
gives 4 chnJclis (coppnr coins) to the boy who then places them in the 
drti after clasping his hands before it. The mother-in-law then re- 
tires, while the father-in-law comes to the spot and jilacing a i^atka 
(white cloth) routul his own neck, washes and worships liis son-in-law's 
feet. The boy's priest gives a duna (leaf-plate) with some rice, a wal- 
unt, drub and flowers into his hands. Both the palms are held up- 
wards, with both thumbs joined, and held up in his hands by the father- 
in-law wlio brings the bridegroom into the verandah while the mantras 
are being recited. After this the bride is brought to the place and 
made to stand a foot from him, face to face Avith the bridegroom. 
'J'he priest then takes hold of the boy's neck with his right hand and 
of the girl's with his loft and makes their shoulders thrice touch each 
other, first pressing the boy's right to the girl's left. Tin's is called 
vhdn par chdn. After this two torches are held on either side of them. 
Seven small pieces of mdlti (jasmine) twigs are then put in the o-irl's 
hands, she drops them into the boy's hands and he breaks them one 
by one, placing them under his right foot. This breaking of the twjo-s 
is called chiri. It is preceded by giving hihun into the hands of the 
couple and they blow it at each other. This goes by the name of /arwr/. 
The pair are next made to sit down and the bov's father-in-law offers 
sankalap, that is gives his daughter away, and then washes the couple's 
feet as they sit before him. Certain minor rites, called chichdri,^ are

the father-in-law sprinkles water on the couple's feet. This second rite is called jiddfr. 

The third or anjli. ceremony is similar, but this time the mixture is made of dhain til 
drub and rice, and after reciting numtras it is sprinkled over the boy's head. ' ' 

The fourth rkdr is called daa hi^hiur and is an exact repetition of the first char. 

The iifth char {nchmnni) is solemnised l)y putting water, iil, and rice in a cup which is 
placed on the ground as was done in the otlier c/«ir..<, but at the end of the ceremony the 
priest thrice throws a few drops of water from the cup on to the father-in-law's hands and 
the boy and they drinV it from his hands. 

The sixth and last char is called madhuparak. The cup is filled with milk til. and rice 
and put in the boy's left hand ; he daubs the four fingers and thumb of his righ't haod with 
it and then lifts his hand towards his mouth and. putting it again into the cup sprinkles 
its contents on thcground. This cup is then taken by one of the bridegroom's' jan (one 
who has come with the procession) and given to the tom-tom player. This jan returns to the 
bridegroom and after being purified by mantras is allowed to mix again with the other meo

now performed by tlie bridegroom and bl3 father-in-law. Then 
Ganpati/^ Bra]ima,t Vishnu, J Kumbh, dia and the nine planets are 
worshipped. After this one end of the o-irl's sheet is held out by her 
brother and on this red Ukka is sprinkled thrice by the boy. Simi- 
larly the boy's wf»ist-band is held out and anointed by the girl. The girl 
then holds up her hands ; and into them 4 copper coins, a walnut, drub, 
flowers, til and rice are thrown by the priest and then the boy is made 
to lay his hands over hers. The priest then takes part of the bride's sheet 
and wra})S both pairs of hands in it by running a tape {dori) round it. 

The girl's father then performs the hanid-ddn (giving the girl 
away) with tho fji'oper mantra-i. At its conclusion the girl's maula 
(mother's brother) touches her wrapper with a copper coin and it is 
then unknotted, the things in the girl's hands being taken by the 
boy and given to the parohit. The gur and ghi is then tasted and 
this concludes the ceremony called lagan. Tho girl 7iow retires, but 
the boy remains to go through another rite called the manihdr.^ After 
doing the drti over the bridegroom, the tape with the betelnut is then 
put on the boy's left toe and he is required to pierce the nut with 
his dagger. This done, the priest takes the taps up and throws it over 
the boy's hsad, passes it down to his heels and under his soles, and 
then ties it round the pagri. The boy is then drawn by the manihdr 
by his mother-in-law and led inside the house to the kdmdeo.W The 
girl is also brought there by her brother and dressed in the harsuhi 
clothes and placed by the boy's side before the picture. Finally the 
remaining 7 doris of the harsuhi are handed over to the boy by the 
girl's mdmi (mother's sister) ; ho places then on the bride's head and 
then her hair is combed and arranged with these doris by her mami 
and the following sono- is sunor : — 

S ARGUN DHI SONG. 
Kim gori baithi sir kholi, hor 
Kun baithi pilh gheri, 

Gaura baithi sir kholi, hor 
Isar bai^hd pith gheri. 

" Who is that beautiful girl sitting with her hair dishevelled ? 
Who is sitting with his back turned ? 

Oh, Gaura is sitting with her hair uncombed, 
Isar (Shiva) is silting with his back turned." 

* Ganpati is represented by a walnut in a green cup, placed before the boy under the canopy 
on a heap of rice. It is given a copper coin— Ganpati being thus in^'oked to keep off mishaps, 

f Brahma's etSgy is made of a few blades of drub, which are turned down twice, the 
ends being fixed in cow-dung and placed in a green cup. He is then similarly worshipped 
as being the Creator of the universe. 

I Vishnu is represented and worshipped like Brahma, but the blades are only turned 
down once from the centre in his case. Vishnu is worshipped as being the first Cause and 
the Protector of the universe. 

§ Mnniltdr. — Nino walnuts (the nine planets) are put on rice and worshipped and their 
blessing invoked. There must be a separate handful of rice for each of the walnuts. A 
bored copper coin, a betelnut and a cotton dori (three cords about H spans long) — all these 
together are called •na?u7itir— but the ceremony is performed by taking the boy out to the 
doorway and there he takes out lus dagger from the waist and touches the coin with its 
point, protending to bore it. '1 he string is then passed through the bored coin and put in 
a «idn» (grain measure) and then the Dvinihar is sanctified and tied round the boy's head* 
dress by his mother-in-law at the gate-way after the drti.

After this the boy's jaul (shoulder-band) and tho brido'd kharvds 
(sheet) are knotted together and the bride is carried by her maternal 
uncle {viaula) to tho canopy wliere the wedding is to be celubrated. 

Under this canopy (laid) tliey are placed, on bamboo baskets covered 
with woollen cloths, facing east. The bridegroom sits to the right of 
tho bride and in front of tho sacred hre {liotiia or havan). The brido's 
father then washes the couple's feel ; after which Gaupati, Navagirah, 
Brahma, Vislniu, Kumbh, Sat RisliI, Chaur Vedi, Chaur-disa (the four 
quarters) and Chaur-updes (the four elements) are worshipped in due 
order, to war. 1 off mishaps. Thi.s is followed by placing fried barley 
in a chhaj (sieve) which is brought to the haid. First, the bridegroom 
takes a handful of this grain and puts it on three ditfer<^nt spots, while 
the bride's brother keeps wiping it away with his right hand as fast as 
it i3 put down. This is repeated, but the second time the brid^-'s 
brother puts the grain down and the bridegroom wipes it away. This 
is called khtla^ hhedni and is done to break the tio of relationship, if 
any exists, between the contracting parties. After this hhila hhedni 
the boy's father puts 4 annas into the chhajX and the bride's brother 
takes off the red piece which he has worn on his head during tho cere- 
mony and puts it in the chliaj too. It is then removed and the 4 annas 
are claimed by the boy's brother-in-law. Then the bride's brother's 
wife conies and grinds turmeric (lialdar) on the sil and sprinkles it wet 
on the feet of the pair, three times on each. Sho receives 4 takas, i.e., 
16 copper coins, for performing this rite. Then the couple are made 
to stand up and walk round tlie sacred 6ro four tim^s from right to 
left. The briilegrooai keeps his right hand on the bride's back all tho 
while. After each turn they are made to halt near the baskets and 
their feet are worshipped, by throwing til, drub, milk, and red colour, 
etc., by the bride's fatlier, and at the end the bride's brother worship:^ 
the couple's feet in the pame way. These four rounds are called 
chdrldi, and constitute the binding rite in the wedding. At the chdrldi 
two women sing the following song :— 

CHARLAI SONii. 

Pahlia Idjdria 2}hirde kiidure,

In the third round they let the anjanX di-ag on the ground 
In the fourth round the diolha (bridegroom) broke it and 
ran away. 

The bride and bridegroom now change seats and sit facing each 
other. The bride then h-^dds up her hauls and in them a green leaf 
cup [duni) containing 8 ^mo walnuts, rice, fl )vvers, 4 coins, etc., is placed 
by the prinst. Tho bridegroom covers tho bride's h mds with his hands 
and then the priest unknots the viinikdr from the boy's pagri and puts

it on their hands. Tho bride's father then takes til, drub, rice, flowers 
and copper coins and the sankalap is peiformed to the recitation of 
mantras. After this he places 4 copper coins and a rupee in the vessel 
containing water, turmeric, milk and curd and sprinkles the mixture 
on tbe haid (canopy). Iliis is called sdj iiana or giving of dowry. The 
bride's mother's brother then comes and touches the boy's and girl's 
hands with a svr of rice and a copper coin, and then they are released, the 
laanihdr being given to the girl to be put round her neck. The rice 
and coin go to the pi-iest. After this all the girl's other relations and 
friends give her presents, either in cash or in kind, according to their 
social position. These presetits are then divided thus : — To the bride's 
and bridegroom's ji)a?o/w7.s 2 annas each; to tho bride's ^^a^fci-carriers 4 
annas; to the bridegroom's the same; and to the carpenter {hddhi) who 
erects tho temple and the canopy [haid) 4 annas also : to the bride's 
musicians 2 annas ; and to the bridegroom's 4 annas. After this the 
bride's j^arohit counts the things received in dowry, receiving for this 8 
copper coins, with four more as dehl (door-way) for acting as the family 
priest. Of the residue a fourth goes to the bride and a tenth of the re- 
mainder is appropriated by her priest. The balance with the canopy is 
then given by the bride's father as sankalap to the boy's father and forms 
part of the paraphernalia. After this the gotra-chdr mantras are read 
and fried rice is thrown towards the couple by both the priests. Each 
gets 4 annas for reading the gotra-chdr. This is followed by making 
the fathers of the couple sit under tliR canopy, and a blade of drub is put 
by the bride's priest into the girl's father's hands. He holds it between 
the tips of his middle fingers at one end, the other end being similarly 
held by the boy's father. The bride's father then says : " asmat kania, 
tusmat gotra," meanint^j "our girl passes to your got." The ends of the 
blade are then reversed and the bo^'s father says: "tusmat kania, asmat 
gotra," meaning " your girl has come into our got." At the conclusion 
the bridegroom comes to the end of the canopy where he receives ruldr 
(salutation with a present) from his mother-in-law and the other elderly 
women of the bride's house. The mother-in-law gives a rupee in cash 
and 4 copper coins, the others only copper coins, and without receiving 
this gift from the women it is not etiquette for him to appear before 
them. The boy touches the bride's mother's feet in token of her giving 
him this privilege. The ceremonies at the bride's are now over and the 
bride is taken in the pdlki, with all the paraphernalia, followed by the 
bridegroom, his followers and friends, to his house. 

Song sung on the bride's arrival at the bridegroom's house— 

Soi ipichaik) aunde-jo ddar de — jdnde-jo bhali mar ; 
Ballare j<'inde-jo mochar-mdr — bhale hhale ddar. 

" Receive the soi (tbose who come with the bride) with courtesy 
and on their departure give them a good thrashing. 

Give to this hallar (bastard) a shoe -boating, this is good treatment 
for him." 

On arrival at the d(;or-way the following song is sung : — 

ATHLAI SONG. 
Ham ku pujna kun gori ai, 
Ham ku pujna Gaura ai, 
Ham ku pujdeputri phal mangde. 



Gadii Weddings, 267 

" Who Is that beautiful girl who has come to worship a pome- 
granate tree ? 

It is (laura who has come to worship, 

While she is worshipping she is praying for a son." 

Then the drti is presented by the boy's mother anil she also gives the 
bride a rupee. Next the pair are conducted to the^ Icdmdeo (picture on 
the wall), and Ganpati, etc., are worshipped, after which they are both 
made to go four times round the earthc.'n lamp {diwa) atid humhh (pot 
containing water), tat)e and a bunch of pomegranate. This circuro- 
ambulatiou is called the athldi (eight rounds). 

After this the bridal veil is taken off by the iiarohii and the imitation 
birds on the veil are given to tho priest, the brothers of tlie couple and 
their newly acquired mltras (brothers mado by sacred observ-ancs). 
Having done the athldi the bride and bridegroom's wrist threads are 
loosened by two men who thus become brothers. These threads were 
put on by them at the commencement of the prelimiuary observances. 

At the conclusion the bridegroom receives presents [tamhol] from the 
men and women, ard similarly munhsdni from the women is received 
by the bride for unveiling her. Songs are sung by the women on these 
occasions. 

The following foast-song is sung at the bridegroom's house: — 

Kuniaye chauha pdya, kuni dhotore hath 2^0,11" , 
Janne, chiuha pdya,soi dhotore hath pair, darohi Rdm Rdm, 

Bhat parithd, mas parlthd, upar parithe tdre mare, 
Bhate mdse khde na jdne soi, hahin lidrdi hare, hare. 

" Who has smeared the floor with cowdung ; who has washed the 
hands and feet ? 

The^a^i (followers of the bridegroom) have done it, the soi (fol- 
lowers of the bride) have washed their hands and feet: we 
appeal to R^m (for the truth of our statement). 

Boiled rice has been given, meat has been given, over them have 

been given small pebbles, 
The soi know not how to eat rice and meat, the sister expreeses 

surprise (by saying) ' hare h are \" 

Four feasts are given in the boy's house to the guests: Ist, on the 
day of the oil ceremony; 2nd, on the morning on which the procession 
starts to the bride's house ; 3rd, on the day the procession returns home, 
and 4th, on the morning on which the bridegroom receives presents. 

The 6rst two feasts are given at the brido's house on the oil day to 
the guests of the girl and the last two on the marriage day to the bride- 
groom and his followers and to the bride's guests. 

Another form of marriage called hujkya is common in which the 
ceremony is gone through only at the bride's house, thus saving ex- 
pense. 

The Gaddis also practise the form of marriage called jhind phuh, 
solemnised by burning brushwood and circun: ambulating the fire eight

times lianc? in hand, or with the bride's sheet tied to the boy's girdle. 
It is admissible in cases where a girl's parents have consented to her 
betrothal bat refuse to carry out the marriage, and is sometimes done 
forcibly by the bridegroom ; or in cases in which a girl elopes with her 
lover. No priest or relative need attend it. 

Widow remarriage is permitted, except among the Brahmans. The 
rite is called gudani or jhanjardra and also choli'dori and is solemnised 
tlius: — The pair are made to sit down by the dkva and Icumhh, with 
some dliap burniner. They worship both these objects, then the bride- 
groom places a dori (tape) on the widow's head and another woman 
combs her head and binds hor hair with the tape. A.fter tbis the bride- 
groom places 'a nose-ring (hdlil) in the woman's hand and she puts it on. 
This is the binding portion of the ceremony. A feast is given to guesta 
and relations and songs are sung. If no priest presides at the ceremony 
the kumhli, etc., worship is dispensed with, but the tape and ring cere- 
mony is gone through and the guests, etc., feasted. A widow used to 
be compelled to marry her husband's elder or younger brother, but the 
custom is no longer enforced by the State. 

Divorce is permitted by mutual consent, but there ia no special form. 
A divorcee may remarry. 

Sons, whether by a wife married for the first time, or by a widow or 
divorc<^e remarried, succeed, but illegitimate sons do not, unless they 
are adopted in default of legitimate sons or heirs. The eldest son gets 
an extra share, called jaithund, but he has per contra to pay a propor- 
tionatoly larger share of any debts. Among the sons the property ia 
otherwise divided miindavand, i e., equally, except in Kangra, where the 
chundavand rule prevails among that small part of the tribes, which ori- 
ginally came from the sonthera side of the upper Rd,vi in Ohamba.* 

The Qaddis also have the cust Jm whereby a widow's child [chaukandhii) 
born at any time after her husband's death succeeds to his property, 
provided that the widow has continued to live in his house and has 
worn a red dori (tape) in the name of his chula (oven) or dardt (axe). 
Cases have even occurred in which the widow has retained her late 
husband's property without complying with these conditions, though 
the Gaddis consider her rights disputable. 

Gaddis burn their dead. Lepei's and those who die of lnhar, a kind 
of typhus, are first buried, but their corpses are exhumed after three 
months and burnt. The ceremonies performed are the same as for those 
who are burnt. The body is placed on the funeral pyre with the head 
of the deceased to the north, and all the jewellery and the blanket, which 
is thrown over it when on the bier, are taken off and the body burnt. 
A copper coin is placed by the pyre as the tax of the land on whichf 
the body is burnt. Fire is first applied to the pyre under the head by 
the neai'est relative and the other gotrts (blood relations). The parohit 
joins the relations in this observance, but no cei-emonies are observed. 
The light is applied after going round the pyre once from left to right. 
On the 10th day after the demise the daspindi ceremony ia performed

by the nearest blood relationa, with tho aid of the 'parohit. Other rela- 
tions wash their clothes and bathe on this day and remove tlio kaiahal 
which is spread to receive the mourners. On the 12th day, at nis/lit, a 
he-goat is sacrificed in the decoaseii's name. This goat is given to tlie 
parohit. Next moiniiig five finds (balls of rice) or one supindi are 
again offered to the deceased by the chief mourner, to the recitation of 
mantras by the paroMt, The clothes, utensils, cnsh, etc., are given to 
him. On the l4th day the deceased's relations on the wife's side come 
to the house in the morning and give a feast to tho brotherhood. A 
goat is killed for this feast and tho mourning ceases from this day. At 
the end of the third month oblations arc again offered to tho deceased 
and the occasion is signalised by a feast to the brotherhood. All the 
ofEerings made in this ceremony go to the parohit who presides over it. 
Similar ceremonies are gone throngh at the end of the sixth month and 
tho 1st and 4th years. 

If buried the body is laid flat in the grave with the back 
on the ground and the palms of both hands folded on the chest. The 
head is kept to the vtar (north). Cliildren and females are buried in 
the same way. When burnt the ashes are collected, together with 
tho seven bones of the finger, knee and ankle joints, on the day the 
corpse is burnt. They are brought to the house in a piece of maaru "^ 
and kept for ten days in the clothes in which the deceased breathed 
.his last and in the room in which he expired. After tho daspindl 
they are washed in honey, milk, clarified butter, cowdung and hilpatri 
seed and then dried and deposited in a sinall wooden box, wrapped in 
the piece of mo.sru and buried in a recess made in the wall of the 
house, with a coating of barley and mustard over it. They should be 
taken to Hardwar to be thrown into the Ganges as soon as tho family 
has collected suBScient funds for the journey, and at most within four 
years. 

The religion of the Gaddis presents some interesting features. As 
we have seen the Gaddis are by preference Shaivas,t but their worship 
is catholic to a degree. Thus on Sundays and Thuisdays Niigs and 
Sidhs are worshipped, on Sundays alono Kailung, Devis on Tuesdays, 
and on Thursdays ' Birs.* 

To the Nags, ahri or beestings, male kids or lambs, and ova (the 
first-fruits of all crops), incenso and small cakes are off ered ; and to 
the Sidhs a sack, a stick of rose-wood, a crutch, sandals and rot or 
thick bread. 

To the Devis are offered vermilion, hindli (brow-mark), S'llu (a red 
chddar), dora (waist-rope), sur (a coarse spirit), and a goat. 

To the Birs a he-goat, a chola or thick woollen coat, a waistband, a 
white conical cap {chulcanni topi) and fine bread. Kailu Bir, the numen 
of abortion, is only worshipped by women. Kailung is a >!ag, and 
the father of all the Nags. He is worshipped, as is Shiva, under the 

• The cloth in which the corpse is wrapped.

form of tho dardt or sickle, which is always carried by a Gaddi 
when shepherding his flocks. Then there is the worship of autars. 
An autar is the spirit of a person who has died cliildless and causes 
sickness. To propitiate this spirit the sick person dons clothes, which 
are made for him with a silver imago of the deceased, and he then 
worships the autar idol (which is always set up near a stream).* 

The clothes and image are worn " in token of the deceased." 
^n^ars are said to have been admitted inio the category of the deities 
owiug to their evil influences on niea and women. They are propiti- 
ated also on the Amd,was and Puranmdshi days. 

Autars also appear in dreams and warn people that they will carry 
them off to the next world. To scare away the ghost in such a case 
jamamvdla is performed, 4 SaZis, offerings of ghunganidn (boiled maize), 
nettle baths, and bran bread being offered four limes by night. 

But these do not exhaust the list of beliefs. Bated is the sprite of 
springM, rivers and wells, and hhicheri, sodden Indian corn, 3 balls of 
suhdL (moss), 3 of ashes, 3 measures of water, a pumpkin or a flour- 
sheep are offered to him. 

To joginis or rock spirits, 3 coloured grains of rice, 5 sweet cakes, a 
loaf, a flour-lamp with a red wick, 3 kinds of flowers, 3 pieces of dhwp, 
and a she-goat are offered with prayers. RdJcshanis and bandsats 
would seem to be the same as joginis. Chungu is the demon found 
on walnut aud mulberry trees and under the karangora shrub. He ia 
worshipped with a cocoa-nut, a chuhora (handle of a plough), almonds, 
grapes, milk and a loaf of 5 paos with his eflSgy in flour (a basket on 
his back), a four-cornered lamp of flour on the bread, and apiece of 
dhup. 

Gunga, the disease-spirit of cows, is propitiated by setting aside a 
tawa of bread in his name until the final offerings can be made. 
Then a piece of iron, something like a hockey-stick, is made, and the 
deity taken into the cattle-shod where he is worshipped by the sacred 
fire on a Thursday. A he-goat is killed and a few drops of the blood 
sprinkled on the iron. At the same time cakes are offered and some 
eaten by one member of the household, but not by more than one or 
the scourge will not abate, and the rest are buried in the earth. Every 
fourth year this deity is worshipped after the same fashion. Kailu is, 
it seems, peculiar to the Gaddis, or at least to Chamba. Early in 
pregnancy the woman puts aside 4 chaklis, (the copper coin of Chamba) 
with her necklace in the name of Kailu. Two or three months after 
delivery the parohit, with the woman, worships the demon by putting 
up a large stone under a walnut or hainth tree, which is sanctified by 
recitino" certain mantras and then worshipped. A white goat (which 
may have a black head) is then offered up to the demon, by making an 
incision in its right ear and sprinkling the blood over a long cloth, 2^ 
yards wide by 9 or 12 yards long, and chaklis and some bread are also 
offered to the demon. 

Finally the woman tastes a piece of gur, and places it on the cloth, 
which she then wears until it is worn out, when a new one ia made and 



* Wheu first set up the idol is worshipped with prayers and the sacrifice of a he-goat or 
sheep. Bhain and IhicUii are also placed before it and then eaten by the axdar's xelativeB.

purified in the same way before being worn. The ceremony may be 
performed at the woman's house, in which case the clotli alone is u.scd as a 
symbol of the deity. The _i;-oat is returned to its owner with the fcmr 
coins. No other woman may use this sheet, which would cause her 
divers bodily ills. 

Ploughing, sowing and reaping should be begun on the lucky days — 
Sunday, Tuesday and Tliursday. Jf the wheat does not grow on a terraced 
field the plough is not put on it again that year until a goat has been 
Bacri6ced there, and neglect of this rule will result in a death in the 
family. When new ground is to be broken up the paroliit must be asked 
to name the day and a he-goat sacrificed before the plough is ])ut to it. 
But instead of this sacrilicc, some people lake four young girls to the spot 
and there wash their feet, mark their foreheads with red and give them 
gxir to eat before they begin to i)lough. And the first fruits of such land 
are always offered to the dcuta before being used. The godlings associ- 
ated with chinia, maize, wheat, pulse and barley are Devi, Chaund, 
Kailung, Kathura Nag and Sandholu Nag respectively. 

The chief fairs are seven in number, viz., the Easua on 1st Baisdkh, 
the Patroru on 1st Bhadon, the Sair on IstAssauj, the Lahori (cr Lohri) 
on 1st Mitgh, and the Dholru on 1st Chet. The dates of the Shibrdt 
(in Phdgan on varying dates) and of the Holi (in Phagan or Chet) vary. 
The first four festivals are celebrated by games and dances, but there 
are differences. At the Basua imidiris or flour cakes are eaten with ghi 
and honey. At the Patroru a cake of a vegetable called siiil is eaten : 
only young girls dance. At the Sair hahrus are cooked : and at the 
Lohri khichri or rice and dal. At the Holi l-haddas (parched maize) aro 
eaten, the fire is worshipped at night and a performance called 6arn held, 
Bongs being also sung. At the Dholru again inndiris are eaten, but 
amusements are rarely allowed. There seems to be no aununl feast of 
dead. Shiva and the Devis are sacrificed to on a Shibnitri. 

The seasons for worship are : — Chet, pilgrimages to Bawan and 
Jawdlaji in Kdngra. 

Bhadon and Asauj, pilgrimages to the shrines of Narsingh, Hari-har, 
Lakshmi Devi, Ganesh, Kailung — all in Brahmaur ; and in Bhadon only, 
as a rule, to Maui Mahesha. Shiva is not worshipped at any particular 
season. 

The low-castes in Brahmaur are chiefly Halis, Kolis, Lohdrs and Rihrf* 
rSs, with afew Sippis and Badhis. All these are described in their 
proper places. An obscure group is the Bararu, sometimes called Bhats, 
who are d<»scribed as Gaddis, and hold among them the same position 
as Btahmans do among other Hindus. The name appears to be connected 
with hardri, a thorny shrub.

Gadhiok, a tribe small in numbers, but intelligent and enterprising, found in 
a few villages o£ tho Central Salt Range. Their traditions assert 
that their ancestor Mahta Uhandu liai came from Mathra to Delhi and 
entered the Mughal service under BAbar, who employed him with Rdja 
Mai Janjua to drain the eastern Dhanni tract in the Salt Range. 
Gharka Kassar and Sidhar Manilas afterwards aided them to colonise 
the tract, and Babar granted Chandu Rai a percentage in the revenue of 
tho Dhanni and other tracts in the Salb Range. Humsiyuu granted 
Kdli orKaiik Dds, son of Chandu Rai, a sanad * (dated 1554) of 30,000 
tankds for the improvement of the Kahun tract and the family also 
received sanads from Akbar and Auraugzeb. In the latter's reign one 
branch of the tribe was converted to Islam, but most of its members 
ttre still Hindus. Gadhiok is said to be a corruption of gaddi-hok, 
on its ancestors having presented 31 gaddls at a Itukdi (the announce- 
ment of the presents brought at a wedding). The Gadhiok usually 
marry among themselves, but some intermarry with Khatris of the 
Bdri group, tliodgh never Avith Bunjahis. In neither case is widow 
marriage allowed. Their Brahman s are of the Nauli got and at a 
boy's munnan or head-shaving the father or head of the Family himself 
decapitates a goat with a sword and gives the head, feet and skin to the 
Naule parohitb' of the tribe, though they do not eat flesh and other 
Brahmans would not touch such offerings. The skin, etc., are sold. 
A similar observance is in vogue at the janeo investiture. Gadhioks 
eat flesh at weddings, a usage contrary to local Hindu custom. At 
the viunnan of a first-born son the custom found among some other 
Khatris is followed and the mother flees to the house of a neighbour 
who plays the part of her parents. Her husband would bring her back 
again, and remarry her by the dukCija or 'second wedding ' which costs 
about half as much as the first. Gadhioks avoid touching weighing 
Bcale3,t at least in theory, and also usury, but one or two families, not 
admitted to be descendants of Kali Diis or true Gadhioks, have no such 
scruple. No Gadhiok will wash, set out on a journey or begin a new 
task on a Thursday — the day on which their ancestor left bis original 
home. Hindu Gadhioks eat and dritik with Khatris : Mubammadans 
with any Muhammadan save a Mochi or Musalli. The latter style them- 
selves Shaikh : while the Hindus generally use the title of Mahta, but 
the family of Dahvdl is styled Diwdn, Mulraj, one of its members having 
been governor of Hazara under the Sikhs. The saviddh of Kdli Dds 
is a conspicuous object at . Kallar Kahilr. The Gadhioks have many 
habits, apparently in a down-country dialect, and now claim Rsijput 
orio^in or statu?, but they are probably of Khatri ertraction as their 
intermarriage with that caste shows.

Sarliang, a groat-gi-andson of Ghurg-liuslit, two of whose sons fletl, they 
say, because of a blood feud to the momitains of Chacli and Ilaziira. 
It is almost certain that the Jadun are not of Indian origin ; though it 
has been suggested that in their name is preserved the name of Jiidu 
or Yadu, the founder of the Hd,iput Yiidubaiisi dynasty, many of 
whose descendants migrated from Guzenit some 1, 100 years b«-foro 
Christ, and were afterwards supposed to bo found in the hills of Kiibul 
and Kandd,har. They occupy all the south-eastern portion of the 
territory between the Peshawar and Ilazara borders, and the southern 
Blopea of Mahdban, having been assigned their present lands in the 
eastern Sama after Malik Ahmad and the Kashi chiefs of the Afghdns had 
defeated the Dilazak. And when Jahangir finally crushed the Dilaz^ik, 
they spread up the Dor valley ns high as Abbottabild. Early in the 
18th century, on the expulsion of the Karlugh Turks by Saiyid JaUl 
Bd,ba they appropriated the country about JDliamtaur ; find about a 
hundred years later they took theBagra tract from the few remaining 
Dilazilk who held it, while shortly before the Sikhs took the country 
their Hassazai clan deprived the Karrtll of a portion of the Nildn valley. 
They are divided into three main clans, Sdlar, Mansiir, and Hassanzai, 
of which the last is not represented among the trans-Indus Jadun and 
has lost all connection with the parent tribe, having even forgotten 
its old Pashtu language. Bellew made them a Gakkhar clan, but 
this appears to be quite incorrect. The true Pathans of Hazara call 
them mldtar or mcrcenai-ios, from the Pashtu equivalent for laJchan or 
" one who girds his loins". In Hazara a Salar occupy the Kajoia plain ; 
the Mansur are found in Mangal and in and round Nnwansbahr ; while 
the Haasanzaia reside in Dhamtaur and the adjacent villages, and in 
the Mangal and Bagra tracts. The two former tribes keep up a slight 
connection with the Pathd.ns to the west of the Induw, and a few can 
still speak Pashtu. After they had obtained a footing to the east of 
the Indus, in Ilazara, those three tribes elected a Hassanzai of Uharataur 
to the /s/idn-ship, and his son succeeded him, but the chiefship is now 
in abeyance, though the family is still looked up to. In rJiis part the 
Durrani rule was quite nominal and the Jaduus of Ilazdra only paid 
them a horse, a falcon or two and a small sum of money as tribute.

•leech.' They also make matting and generally work in grass and 
straw, and in some parts the coarse sacking used for bags for pack 
animals and similar purposes is said to be made almost entire Ij- by 
them. The Muhammadan Giigras marry by nlkoh. They seem to 
fulfil some sort of functions at weddings, and are said to receive fees on 
those occasions. It is said that they worship Bahi Shah, the Chiihra 
guru. Also called Gagri or Gegri and Jokliaru.

GAKK^A^l, an important Muliammadan tribe, found in JUelum, Rawal- 
pindi aud Ilazilra. Regarding tbo Gakkhars in the first-named district 
Mr. W. S. Talbot writes :— 

" The Gakkhars, though not numerically important, are in other respects 
one of the most prominent tribes in the Jlielum district, and in social 
position amongst the Musalmans of the tract share with the Janjuit 
the honour of the first place : in popular estimation indeed they seem to 
rank a little higher than oven the Janju^s. They are almost entirely 
confined in this district to the Jhelum tahsil, where they hold the bulk 
of the Khuddar circle, with a good many villages in the Maiddn: else- 
where they are found ia any numbers only in the Rawalpindi and 
Hazdra districts. 

Origin, — Of the history and origin of this tribe much has been written : 
the earliest suggestion, that of General Court, that the name of the 
Gakkhars points to their flescent from the Greeks, has not found 
later supporters : though it has now been adopted and improved upon by 
some of the present representatives of the tribe, who claim descent from 
Alexander himself ! Mr. A. Brandreth * adopted the local tradition, that 
the Gakkhars ' came from Persia through Kashmir,' which is still the 
claim of the majority of the Gakkhars themselves. The views of 
General Cunningham are set forth at length in his ArcliEeological 
Survey Reports, II, pp. 22 to 3-:^, to which the curious must be 
referred for the detailed reasons on which he basos his conclusion, that 
the Gakkhars represent the ' savage Gargaridae ' of Dionysius the 
Geographer, (who wrote probably in the 4th Century A. D.), and 
are descendants of the great Yuechi Scythians, who entered India from 
the North- West in the early centuries of the Christian era. Sir 
Denzil Ibbetson t notices with approval Mr. Tliomson^s comment X 
on Cunningham's theory; though the Turanian origin of the Gakkhars 
is highly probable, yet the rest of the theory is merely a plausible 
surmise. On the whole there seems to be little use in going beyond the 
sober narrative of Ferishta, who represents the Gakkhars as a brave 
and savage race, living mostly in the hills, with little or no religion, and 
much given to polyandry and infanticide.' 

As already indicated, the story of most of the Gakkhars is that they are 
descended from Kaigollir or Kaigwar Shah, of the Kaidni§ family once 
reigning in Ispahan : thac they conquered Kashmir and Tibet, and ruled 
those countries for many generations, but were eventually driven back to 
Kabul whence thny entered the Punjab in company with Mahmud 
Gha^navi early in the 11th Century: thi'S story is rejec'ied by Ibbetson,

because on Ferishta's showing a Gakkhar army resisted Mahmud : and 
that it IS at any rate certain that they lield tlioir present poseessions long 
before the Muharamadan invasion of India : on tho other side it will be 
of interest to notice briefly below tho contentions of tlio most prominent 
member of the tribe of tho present time, the late Kluin Bah;'idiir R:'ijit 
Jah.indiid Kluln, E. A. C, who has made a most painstakincr study of 
the original authorities : it must bo noted, however, that, particnlarly in 
the exactness of tho references to the aathoritios cited by him, there is 
something wanting, owing to his omission to supply further information 
asked for : his views are as follows : — 

All the historians before the timo of Ferishta agree that tlie Kho- 
khars, not the Gakkhars, killed Shah;1,b-ud-din Ghori. Ferishta cer- 
tainly confuted those two tribe>i, in other cases : thus ho frequently 
refers to Shekha and Jasrat as Gakkhar chiefs; therA are no sutsh 
names in the Gakkhar tree, whereas Shekha and Jasrat appear as 
father and son in the genealogy of the Khokhars : see tree o-iven in tho 
vernacular settlement report of the Gujrat district, by Mirza Azim Betr^ 
l8Qo. {T>ibaqdt-i-Akbari, pp. 18, Id, 127, 147 and 600; Rauzat-ut- 
T(ihirin, E\Vv)t, I, p. ^01; Muntakhib-ut-Tawdrikh, p. 18; Ibn-i-Asir 
Elliot, II, p. 43?; Tabaqdt-i-NcUiri, pp. 123-4, etc.) 

Ferishta's account of tho Gakkhars as a tribe of wild barbarians 
without either religion or morality, practising polyandry and infanti- 
cide, is a literal translation from the Arabic of, Ibn*i-Asir, an earlier 
historian, who was there, however, writing of the wild tribes in the 
hills to the west of Peshawar, and not of the Gakkhars : the chapter in 
Ibn-i-Asir immediately following deals with the murder of Shahdb-ud- 
din by the Gakkhars : hence perhaps the mistake ; or Ferishta may have 
borne a grudge against tho Gakkhars, who are said by him to have 
maltreated an ancestor of his own named Hindu Sh^h. (Ibn-i-Asir 
p. 82, Elliot, XII, Ferishta, p. 159). ' 

Gakkhar ShSh, alias Kaigwdr Shd,h, is mentioned as one of the prin- 
cipal followers of Mahmud of Ghazni. [Iqbdlndma-i-Jahdngiri, p. 109; 
Ahbar Ndma, p. 242). 

The use of the Hindu title of " Rdjd," has been taken as evidence that 
tho Gakkhar story of their origin is incorrect ; but up to comparatively 
recent times the Gakkhar chiefs used the title of Sultdn. Some sannds 
of the Mughal emperors are cited, and other evidence, but the refer- 
ences need not be given, as it is certain that the title of Sultdn was 
formerly used by this tribe. 

In La Perron's History of the Pdrsis,^ p. 27, it is said that a migration 
of Persians to China, under a son of Yazdezard, took place in the 7th 
century : it is suggested that this was tho occasion when the ancestors 
of the tribe settled in Tibet : an old M.S. pedigree-table produced shows 
a Sultan Yazdajar some 45 generations back. 

An officer who knew tho Gakkhars well wrote of them : ' Some 
of their principal mo,n are very gentlemanly in their bearing, and show 
unmistakably their high origin and breeding ' : anotlior says : ' They 
are essentially the gentlemen and aristocracy of tho (R;twalpindi\ 
district: . . . Tho Gakkhars still bear many traces of their hiirfi 
descent in their bearing, and in the estimation in which they are held

276 The Gahhhar dans. 

througliout tho district/ Mr. Thomson wrote of them: 'Physically the 
Gakkhars aro not a lar^e-limbed race, but tliey are compact, sinewy, 
and vigorous. They make capital soldiers, and it has been stated on 
pood authority that they are the best light cavalry in Upper India. 
They are often proud and self-respecting, and sometimes exceedingly 
wcll-mannorod.' All this does them no more than justice ; and to any- 
one who knows them well, tho statement that as late as the 13th 
century they were wild barbarians, without religion or morality, is in 
itself almost incredible. Raja, Jahdnd£d Khdn seems to have succeeded 
in tracing the libel to its origin : he shows also that they have 
sometim.ea bren confused with the Khokhars ;* but it cannot be said that 
his arguments in favour of their Persian origin are very couvincing : 
in the matter of the assassination of Shah^ib-ud-din Ghori, the his- 
torians who state that he was killed by the Gakkhars at Dhamiak in 
this district are supported by a strong local tradition. 

Clans and Man(li8.--The Gakkhars have split into many branches, of 
which the most important in this district are the Admal, the Iskandrd,! 
and the Bugial, who occupy most of the Khuddar circle : a smaller 
clan named Firozal hold a few villages close to Jhelum : and a still 
smaller branch, the Tulidl (which is little esteemed, and with which the 
other clans do not intermarry), has four or five estates on the river near 
Dina. The clan-names are in all cases derived from those of the com- 
mon ancestors : the principal seats or mother villages of each branch are 
called Mandis, of which there are six generally recognised in the Jhelum 
district : Sultd.npur (Admal) ; Lehri and Bakrdla (Iskandrd,!) ; Domeli, 
Padhri, and Baragowdh (Bugidl) : Bheth and Salihdl, formerly flourish- 
ing mandis of the Bugidl, are now decayed. 

Character. — Regarding the character of the Gakkhars there is not 
much to add to what has already been said : pride of race is very strong 
in them, and though they make good soldiers, they are bad farmers : 
and where they have not fallen back on Government service, they are 
almost always in a most unprospeious condition, being much wanting 
in industry and thrift : their most unpleasing characteristic is their in- 
tense jealousy of one another, which leads to bitter feuds^ and some- 
times to murder. 

History. — The first settlement of the tribe in this district is generally 
• admitted to be Abridm in Suitdnpur, under the Lehri hills : thence 
they spread over the Khuddar, soutliwards towards the river, and as 
far as Landi Patti to the west, being constantly opposed by the Janjuds 
who were almost invariably defeated and ejected : in his first invasion 
of India Bilbar took the part of the JanjiHs, and with them defeated 
Hati Khdn, the great Gakkhar chief of Pharwala, but in a subsequent 
invasion made friends with the Gakkhars and procured from them an 
auxiliary force. When Bdbar's son, Humayiin, was in A. D. 1542 
ousted by Sher Shdh, the principal Gakkhar chiefs took the side of the 
exile: to bridle their pride Sher Shdh built the huge fort of Kohtas, 
about ten miles from Jhelum : and in the constant warfare that followed 
the Gakkhar country was terribly harried, but the tribe was never sub- 
dued, and en Humiiyun''s return to power began to grow powerful.

Their enbseqaent history until the rise of " Snltdn " Muqarrab Khdn, 
about 1740 A. D., chiefly concerns other districts : he was nn Adniill 
chief of the Kdwalpindi district; and claimed to rule the \vholo of the 
tract from Attock to the Chenab ; tiie Domoli Bugiiils however did not 
acknowledge his pretensions, and or\ his dofcHt by the Sikhs at Gujrjit, 
they at once rebelled, captured Muqarrab Kluiii and murdered him. The 
usual internecine feuds then arose, and tlio diileront clans fell in turn 
an easy prey to the Sikhs, thou^^li the easiern hill iiiand'is were never 
thoroughly subdued, and were in constant rebellion until the beginning 
of tlie British rule: in 1849 the Gakkhars nearly all took the losing 
side, and therefore forfeited much of their possessions and dignities, 
falling on evil days, from which they have only extricated themselves 
by the readiness with which they have siuce taken employment under 
Government."^ 

In Haz^ra the Gakkhars have had a still more chequered history. 
Descended from Fateh Khc4n, founder of Kh.1,npur, to whom the hills of 
Khdnpur as well as those of the Karral and Dhiind were entrusted by 
his grandfather Sultdn Sarang Khi'm about the end of the 16th century, 
the Ghakkars could not keep the Karriil and Dhiind tribes under control 
during the decline of tlie Mughal dynasty. Under Durrdni rule how- 
ever they were given charge of the lower parts of Hazara, their chief 
Sultiin Jdfar Khan being famous for his uprightness. But Sirddr Hari 
Singh drove them from their lands and they were not roiustated till 
1868-72, when they recovered almost the whole of the Khdnpur tract.

tion of the Yusufzai tribe. They hold the whole of the north-western 
part of trans-Indus Dera Ismail east of Tdnk and south of the Nfla Koh 
ridge of the Salt Range, comprising an area of 460 sfiuare miles, abutting 
on the Sulaim^^ns to the west ; and the town of Kulachi is their head- 
quarters. They were originally a poor iiaioindah and pastoral tribe, 
but they now cultivate more largely than any other Dera Ismilil Pathdna. 
They reached the height of their prosperity about the middle of the 
J 8th century, but lost their eastern possessions some seventy years later, 
they being confiscated by Nawab Muhammad Khdn, the Saddozai 
governor of Leiah. They still engage in the pawindah traffic. They 
are lawless, brutal and uncivilised ; and their hereditary Khan has but 
little power. Mr. St. George Tucker thus described their sections:-—

ancestors, but there is no doubt, as in mcst similar cases, that other

tribea and familiea have been associated with them from time to time, 
who all claim now to be of the original stock. They are divided into 
six main divisions or nallahs (valleys*). Most of these nalloha have a 
single generic name, covering all the men of that nallah ; but there aro 
also joint nallahs, in which two altof):ether distinct sections aro combined, 
each having a generic name of its own. The hereditary chiefship 
rested at first with the Brahimzai nallah, but the Brahirazaia having 
been very much weakened by losses in a fight against the Bdbars, tlie 
chiefship was transferred some 200 years ago to the Hamrdnzai, who 
have retained it ever since. Azild Kluin was the first Hamrdnzai Khdn. 
It was in his time that the Gandapurs seized Takwdra from the 
Driskhels. Kuldchi was soon afterwards settled by fugitive Baloch 
from Dera Fateh Khd^n, from whom it obtained its name. These 
eventually returned to their own country, and Kuldchi became the head 
town of the Gandapurs".

knives and swords, cut wood, and generally do odd jobs. They are said 
to eat tortoises and vermin. They also keep donkeys, and even engage 
in trade in a small way. It is said that in some parts they lead about 
performing bears ; but this is doubtful. They have curious traditions 
which are reported from distant parts of the Province, regarding a king- 
dom which the tribe once possessed, and which they seem inclined to 
place beyond the Indus. They say they are under a vow not to wear

Gab or Garh and Samal or Samcl. — The two factions into which the Pathans 
and other tribes of the North-West Frontier were, and to some extent 
still are, divided. Many legends designed to explain the origin of 1, 

these factions are current. When Rajit, runs an old tradition, ruled / 
in the modern North-West Frontier Province his wazir Gomal o-overned 
Balochistdn as far as Waziristan as his viceroy. Gomal had two 
nephews, Samal and Garh, between whom the country was divided. 
Hence Samal comprises the Spin and Tor gund tribes borderino- on 
Khost in Afghanistan, and the Zakka Khel, Aka Khel, Sih Pai, Qamrai 
the Tamam Khatak of Tirah, the Afridi country, and generally speakino- 
all the tribes of the Kohat and Bannu districts. Gar or Garh 
comprises the Qamar Khel, Kiiki Khel, Adi Khel, Aya Khel, and many 
villages of the Orakzai, Musazai, Mula Khel, Mushtai, Bazotai, Alisher- 
zai, etc. According ta Cockerell these factions are not now of much 
importance, having been superseded by the more rabid enmity between 
Sunni and Shi'a, but Major James writing in 1870 described the feud 
between them as still very strong and bitter and merely supplemented 
by that between the two sects. He assigned to the Samil half the 
drakzai and Bangash, tno Molimand, Malik-din Khel, Sipdh (Sih Pai) 
and Kamr, with the Znkka, Aka and Adam Khels of the Afridis, and

by Ibbetson, that the factions originated in the fratricidal enmity of the 
two sons of the ancestor of the Bangash, who woro called Bun-kash 
or * root-de.stroyers ' on that account, derives support from tho fact 
that the two great branches of the Batjgash arc called Gari and

ally visit the Rajput villages in the Siaikot and Zaffarwal tahsils about

they are Hindus, but their standing is low and their religious beliefs 
are hazy. They invariably have a zither-like instrument called a king.

Gaur — Gaurwdh. 281 

Gaur, a variant of Gd,vr or Gabr, 'unbeliever' among the Baloch. The 
Gaur gave their name to the town of Gauram (Dames' Popular Poetry 
of the Baloches, p. 163). Cf. also Gibari and Gabr. 

Gaujr, agroup of the Brahmans, confined almost entirely to the eastern 
districts, the Punjab Himalayas and the sub-montano as far west as 
Gujrdt. The Gaurs a.'o generally divided into two classes, adh- or pure 
Gaurs, and gattas who arc of illegitimate descent. In the Delhi 
territory the latter class appears to be called Dhakckka or Doghla. In 
Sirmur State the ac?/i-Gani*s arc said not to intermarry with the gattas. 
Tho adh-Gama are themselves sub-divided into chiUi and kali kantJu- 
todlds, or ' wearers of Avhitc and black rosaries/ a division which is 
undoubtedly sectarian. Trans-Giri in this State the highest section of 
the Brahmans Cand apparently Gaurs) is the Pabuch which does not 
intermarry with the Bh^ts though its members may eat food cooked 
by Bhdt girls, yet may not eat it if cooke'l by a Pabuch. On the 
other hand a Pabuch may not eat food cooked by a girl of his own 
section if she has been married to a Bh^t. Tho Pabuch refrain from 
killing any animal and from eating flesh. 

Tho Gaurs are divided into 36 sasaiis* or sf'ctions which appear to 
bo exog;*mous, and every Brahman group similarly divided, as are tho 
Dakauts, may be taken to bo of Gaur origin. It is not at all improbable 
that tho Khandiiudl Brahmans are aluo a branch of the Gaurs. t 

The Tagas of Karnal are certainly Gaurs who have taken to cultiva- 
tion, and 80 apparently are the criminal Tagus also. 

The Gaurs of Hissar say they came originally from Beno-al 
but more probably they came as parohits or family priests of the various 
immigrant tribes among whom they are settled.^ As elsewhere they 
are fed on the 13th day after death, but will not take offerings of black 
colour [Jcdld dan), nor those made at eclipses [grahn kd dan or on a 
Saturday. They will however accept offerings not only from ao-ricul- 
tural tribes but also from Khiitis, Kurahars, Lobars, Nais, BHiido-is 
and Jogis, though not from Chuhras or Chamars. The great majority 
of them have, like the Sarsut, adopted agriculture and are not directly 
engaged in religious functions. The Gaur is held in poeuliarly low 
estimation by the people, apart from his religious status. Sec also 
Gautam. 

Gaujriwah — (Gaurai or Gaulai appears to be a synonym in Gurgaon)— -a 
term applied generally to any Rajputs, who have lost rank by practisin:' 
karewa.^ In Delhi however they form a distinct clan, and thou<i"h both 
they and the Chauhan permit widow remarriage, they are looked upon 
as a separate tribe. They are described as noisy and quarrelsome, but 



* The term ndsan means originally a grant of land and is still used in that sense in Chamba 
(Gaictiec)-, p. 131), and in Mandi iGa-cttco; p. 20). The process by which the term sd»a>» 
came to mean a section of a caste is obscure. The Brahminical (jotrax are of course still 
preserved by the i^aur and appear lo cross-divide the sdsans. Roth sdsans and gotrus are 
further sub divided into countless alu. Thus tho Gaur 'sub-tribe' (zdf or jdt) contains an 
nl called Indauria, ' from Indaur' who arc by r/otm BharadwHJ and pamhita of the Lohin 
Jits. The vagueness of the Brahmans in ''Urgaon as to theii* aia and gota is however 
astonishing : Gurgaon Settlement Rep., 1872-83, p. 32.

where they arc rcprc-iented by a single got, the Maithal, which has 
52 alb: The Gautam appears to rank below the Gaur, for the latter 
will smoke from the same huqqa as a Gaur, but in smoking with a 
Gautam or Chaurasia will remove the mouthpiece and use his hand in 
its stead. Gaurs too will drink from a Gautam's brass vessel, but not 
from his earthenware, whereas, they say, a Gautam will drink from a 
Gaur's. But the Gautaius deny this.

Tsonkhapa, the first Grand Lama ol: Gahldan, and now found chiefly in 
Tibet, where both the Dalai and Tashi Lamas belong to it. The monks 
are bound to celibacy, and certainly refrain from marriage, though in 
the years of their novitiate they are said to be by no means immacalate. 
Tlieir outward mark is a yellow cap. 

The founder Tsonkhapa belonged to a school of reformers of whom 
Bromston (pron. Tomton) is the best known (circ. 1150). Bromston 
lived in the Ki monastery and the tradition of his residence there 
was preserved till the time of Csoma de Kosroes, about 1820, but 
it was lost during the Dogra War in 1842. Mr. Francke thinks that 
de Kosroes rightly identified Ki with the celebrated Hons of Rvasgengs 
(pron. Rareng). Bromston's name is preserved in Bromston-chu 
(Tointon-chu) and Brorastonsna, ' the stream and rock of Bromston ' 
near Ki. He apparently founded the Kadempa sect in the Rdreng 
monastery and either there or at Ki Tsonkhapa studied his works* 
and inaugurated a new reformation. His object was to restore the 
ancient Buddhist faith and purify it from Tantraism. His brethren 
were to bo celibates and use no wine. He even attempted to restore 
the priestly garb of the ancient Indo-Buddhist church, and to this 
day the Gelukpa novices {yetahul} wear nothing but yellow, at least 
in Spiti : but Lamdism as usual proved too strong and though piobably 
the dress of the whole community was yellow the distinctive colour 



* Tsongkliapa eliminated the rgiut, the Sanskrit Tantra txom the Kagiur, whereas the 
Eiugniapa still accept it.

in his cap and girdle^, and on high festivals monks of high dt-groo 
wear yellow silk coats undernoatli their red shawls. To some extent 
Tsonkhapa's reforms produced a liigher moral standard, and tho 
Gelukpas are in name celibate everywiiere, though probably not proof 
against temptation in tlie polyandr(ms homes where their summers 
are spent. In Spiti they do not even profess to be teetotalers. 
The Ki, Lhao(t)pai Gonpa near Dankhar, and Tabo monasteries in 
Spiti belong to this order, and Ki keeps up an intimate connexion 
with Tibet, those of its monks who aspire to high rank being obliged to 
qualify at the dGuvai Khamszan monastery in Tashi Lunpo near

Ghaewal, a tribe of Rajputs, found in the upper part of Kahuta, in Rawal- 
pindi. They claim descent from one Pir Kala, a son of R^jd, Mall (ances- 
tor of the Janjud-s). He married Kaho Rd,ni when he came to those 
hills, and named the ildqa in which he settled Kahru after her. Hence 
his descendants were called Kahrwal or Gharwal. The tribe is numer- 
ous and important, living in a picturesque country. The DuMl is a 
branch of this tribe. 
Ghasi, fem. -ar : also ^r/iassi, a grass-cutter, in Multd,n; the term is also 
used in the hills. Cf. ghasidrd, fem. -i, -an, a grass-cutter. Neither 
appear to form distinct castes. 
Ghattu, a Muhammadan Jat clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery, 
Ghatwal, one of the Jdt tribes of the South-East Punjab. They trace their 
origin from Garh Ghazni, and place ihat city in the Deccan and not in 
Afghanistan. They claim descent from Saroha Rdjputs. Their head- 
quarters are at Ahulana in the Gohana tahsil of Rohtak, and they 
occupy the country between it and the Jumna, being numerous in the 
north of Delhi and to the south of Karnal. AhuUna is said to have been 
founded 22 generations ago, and gives its name to the Haulania faction. 
The Ghatwal are often called malak, a title they are said to have 
obtained as follows : — 

"In the old days of Rdjput ascendancy the Rd,jputs would not allow 
Jats to cover their heads with a turban, nor to wear any red clothes, nor 
to put a crown {mor) on the head of their bridegroom, or a jewel \nat) 
in their women^s noses. They also used to levy seignorial rights from 
virgin brides. Even to this day Kajputs will not allow inferior castes 
to wear red cloihes or ample loin clothes in their villages. The Ghat- 
wdls obtained some succe-»sps over the Rdjputs, esp<-cially over the 
M-mdHhars of the dodh near Deoban and Mint,'laur, and over those of 
the Bdgar near Kdldnaur and Dadri, and removt- d the obnoxious pro- 



* The name is said to be derived from ghar, a mountain and shin, green or fruitful, 
because while residing about Bora and Peshi'n, two Sayyids, at the request of the herdsmen 
of the tribes, solicited divine aid to turn their bleak and rugged hills into grass-covered 
ranges.

hibitions. They thus acquired the title of maldk (master) and a red 
turban as their distinguishino- mark ; and to tliis day a Jat witli a 
red pagri is most probably a Gha^wal." 

Mr. Fanshawe says that the title is a mere nickname conferred 
by a malih or chief called Rdi Si'd ; yet in Rolitak they appear 
generally to be called malak rather than Ghatwiil.* In Jind the 
Ghatwj'il reverence Bairagis as their jatheras. In Hissdr the Brahmans 
of Depdl are their paroJiits to this day, because their ancestor rescued 
the only surviving woman of the tribe, after the Hajputs of Kalanaur 
had blown up all the rest of the Ghatwi'ils, who had defeated them. 

Ghaunrar, a sept of Rdjputs, descended from Mian Bajokhar, son of 
Saugar Chand, 16th Riija of Kalilur. 

Ghazlani, a Pa^h^n clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Ghbba, a tribe of Rdjput status in the Attock district. Tradition makes the 
Gheba, Sidl and Tiwitna descendants of Gheo, Saino and Teno, the three 
sons of Rcli Shankar Punwdr.f The Sial and Tiwdna appear to admit 
the relationship, and it is not at all impossible that this group of Rdjput 
tribes may be of Punwdr origin. The Gheba are said to have come to 
the Punjab some time after the SidI and Tiwd;na, and to have settled in 
the wild hilly country of Patahjang and Pindigheb in Attock. Here 
they held their own against the Awfins, Gakkhars, and neighbouring 
tribes till Ranjit Singh subdued them. The Jodra are said to have come 
from Jammu, or according to another story from Hindustan, whence 
also Colonel Cracroft says that the Gheba traditions trace that tribe, 
and to have held their present tract before the Gheba settled alongside 
of them.J They now occupy the eastern half of the Pindigheb, and the 
Gheba the western half of the Fatahjang tahsil in Rawalpindi, the 
two tracts marching with each other. The Gheba is also said to be in 
reality a branch of the original Jodra tribe that quarrelled with the 
others, and took the name of Gheba which till then had been simply a 
title used in the tribe ; and the fact that the town of Pindigheb was 
built and is still held by the Jodra, and no*; by the Gheba, lends some 
support to the statement. The history of the Gheba family is told at 
pages 538 ff. of Sir Lepel Griffin's Punjab Chiefs'. Colonel Cracroft 
described the Gheba as " a fine, hardy race of men, full of fire and 
energy, not addicted to crime, though their readiness to resent insult 
or injury, real or imagined, or to join in hand-to-hand fights for 
their rights in land, and their feuds with the Jodra and Alpial are 
notorious."

The Ghilzais. 



Ghilzai, GhalzAi, a tribe of the Matti brancli of the Pa^hdns, and till the rise 
of the Durrani power, the most fainous of all the Afghi'in tribes. The 
official spelling of the name is Ghaleji at Kabul and Kandahar. They 
first rose into notice in the time of Mahmud Ghaznavi, whom they 
accompanied in his invasions of India. Not long afterwards they 
conquered the tract between Jal^il:ibd,d and Keliit-i-Ghilzai, and spread 
east and west over the country they now hold. In the beginning of 
the 18th century they revolted against their Persian rulers^ established 
then'.selves under Mir Wais as independent rulers at Kandahar, and 
overran Persia. But a quarter of a century later they were reduced 
by Nadir Shdh, and their rule disappeared, to be succeeded not long 
after by that of the Durrani. They are of the same stock as the Is^ 
Khel and Lodi Pathans, as the following pedigree table shows : —

Tradition derives the name Ghalzai fro.u ghalzoe, the 'illicit (first-born) 
son' of Bibi Md.to by Shd-hHusain, whom she afterwards married. Her 
descendants first dwelt in the Shilghar territory, south of Ghazni, but 
when the Ghalzai became numerous, they drove the Nid,zis to the east- 
ward, and the Andar branch of the Ghilzais still hold Shilghar. Other 
branches are the Hotak or Hotaki, Kharoti, Nasir or N^siri, Sulimdn 
Khd,n, Taraki and Tokli. Of thes*- the Kharoti and Nd,sir however 
do not appear to be true Ghilzais, but to be descendants of one of 
the several Turk tribes located on the western frontiers of the Ghazni 
kingdom, towards the Afghd,nistdn, by the Turk feudatories under the 
Samanis and the Turk Sultans of Ghazni. The Hotaki is the royal

clan, auJ from it sprang tlio Hsiji, "Wais,* and the Sultans, Mahmud, 
Ashraf and Husain. Tho Ghilzai aro fciuud almost txclubivcly as 
nomads in tlio North- Weist Frontier Province and the Punjab, and form 
with the Lodi Pathd,ns tho bulk of the Pawjndah folk. 

Ghirth. — The Ghirths fill much the sirinio position in Kangra proper and the 
hills below it as do the Kanots in tho parts to tho east. They correspond 
also to the Bahti iti the eastern and the Changf in the western portion 
of the lower ranges. All three intermarry freely, and wofO considered 
by Sir James Lyall as identical. The Ghirths of Kangra and Iloshidr- 
pur were thus described by Barnes : — 

" My previous remarks (sec Rathi) will have introduced the reader to the Ghirths. They 
form a considerable item in the copulation of these hills, and in actual numbers exceed any 
other individual caste. With the Ghirths I have associated the few .Jats that reside in this 
district, and the Changs, which is only another name for Ghirths, prevalent about Ilaripur 
and Nurpur. They amount altogether to 111,507 souls. The Ghirths are sub-divided 
into numerous sects. There is a common saying that there are 360 varieties of rice, and 
that the sub-divisions of the Ghirths are equally extensive, the analogy arising from the 
Ghirths being the usual cultivators of rice. The Ghirths predominate in the valleys of 
Palam, Kancjra, and Rihlu. They are found again in the Hal Dun, or Ilan'pur valley. 
These localities are thu strongholds of the caste, although they are scattered elsewhere in 
every portion of the district, and generally possess the richest lands and the most open 
spots in the hills. The Ghirths belong to the Sudra division of Hindus, and this fact 
apparently accounts for the localities wherein they are found. The open valleys, although 
containing the finest lands, are also the only accessible portions of tho hills. The more 
relined castes preferred the advantages of privacy and seclusion, although accompanied by 
a sterner soil and diminished returns. They abandoned the fertile valleys to less fastidious 
classes, whose women were not ashamed to be seen nor to work in the fields, and the men 
were not degraded by being pressed as porters. 

The Ghirths are a most indefatigable and hard-working race. Their fertile lands yield 
double crops, and they are incessantly employed during the whole year in the various 
processes of agriculture. In addition to the cultivation of their fields, the Ghirth women 
carry wood, vegetables, mangoes, milk and other products to the markets for sale ; many 
sit half the day wrangling with customers until their store is disposed of. The men aro 
constantly seized for b(.';/(/c, or forced labour, to carry travellers' loads, or to assist in tho 
various public buildings in course of construction. From these details it will be perceived 
that the Ghirths have no easy lime of it, and their energies and powers of endurance must 
be most elastic to boar up against this incessant toil. 

To look at their frames, they appear incapable of sustaining such fatigue. The men aro 
short in stature, frequently disfigured by goitre (which equally affects both sexes), dark 
and sickly in complexion, and with little or no hair on their faces. Both men and women 
have coarse features, more resembling the Tartar physiognomy than any other type, and 
it is rare to see a handsome face, though sometimes the younger women may be called 
pretty. Both sexes arc extremely addicted to spirituous drinks. Although industrious 
cultivators, they are very litigious and quarrelsome ; but their disputes seldom lead to 
blows ; and though intemperate they are still thrifty, — a Ghirth seldom waste? his substance 
in drink. In their dealings with one another they are honest and truthful, and altogether 
their character, though not .so peaceable and manly as the Rathi, has many valuable and 
endearing traits. The Ghirths being Sudras do not wear the janeo or thread of caste. 
They take money for their daughters, but seldom exchange them, Tho .yoimger brother 
takes his brother's widow ; if she leave his protection, he was entitled by the law of 
the country to her restitution, and under us he should at all events receive money 
compensation." 

* Mir Wais Hotaki gained possession of Kandahar in 1708-0 and on his death in 1720 
was succeeded by his brother Abdul-Azfz, but he was speedily deposed and Mfr Wais' 
elder son Shah Mahmiid raised to power. lie subdued Persia in 1722-23 and was there 
succeede<l by his cousin Shah Ashraf, but this ruler was overthrown by Nadir Shah. 
Meanwhile Shah llusain, Mahmiid's brother had become ruler of Kandahar and he not 
only refused Shah Ashraf an asylum, but had him put to death. Shiih Husain reduced 
the Slial district and Fxishang, which the Baloch chief Mihrab Khan had aimexed, and 
caused Dera Gh4zi Khan to be sacked by a detachment— a disaster from which Ghizi 
Khan's family never recovered.

The Ghirth septs. 



The Ghirths are said to be of Edjput origin by mixed marriages or 
illegitimate intercourse. They are fssentially agricultural, and the 
proverb says : — " As the rice bends in the ear the Ghirth lifts his head." 
Their social position is low. "You can no more make a saint of a 
Ghirth than expect chastity of a buffalo," and they practise widow 
marriage,. for " You can't make a Ghirthni a widow, any more than you 
can turn a hill buffalo into a barren cow." 

Folk etymology derives Ghirth from ghi, because Shiv made them out 
of ghi. In Hoshiarpur Ghirths are called Bahti.'^ In Hindustan they 
arc called Kurmi. Chang is the Punjabi name, and Ghirth the Pahdri 
word. 

The Ghirths have few large sub-divisions. The eight largest are the 
Kandal, Bhardwaj, Pathari, Chhabru, TJeru, Badial, Chhora, andBhattu. 
Bhardw^-j (a Brahtninical gotra), is also found as an al among the Brah- 
mans of Chamba.t Chh^bru is found only in Hoshiarpur, and Chhora 
and Bhattu only in Kangra. The others occur in both Districts. But 
the Ghirths say that they have a large number of als or septs — 360 in 
all. A great part of these are named after villages. Others are 
named after trades, occupations, etc., etc. A very few are possibly 
totemistic in origin. 

Among these septs occur the following names :— 

A. — Names of animals or plants : — 



(4) Gidar, jackal, 
(o) Gadohari, a kind of bird. 
(6) Garuri, ' an animal like a 
pig-' 
B. — Names of occupations or nick -names : — 



(1) Dhare, fruit of the wild 

fig. 

(2) Ghora, horse. 

(3) Khunla, a kind of bird. 



small 



[]) Suran^iala, miner. 
(2; Nande, nandhi, dumb. 
(8) Mormar, peafowl-hunter. 

(4) Jokhnu, weighman, 

(5) Paniari, panidrd, water- 

man. 

(6) Masand, long-haired 

(said to be its meaning). 

(7) Lakria, woodman. 

(8) Ghord, jockey. 

(9) Hariala, born on the 

Rihdli or 3rd Bliadon. 

C. — Names of colours :— 

(1) Kiila, black. 

(2) Kahra, red-brown. 



(10) Saini, vegetable-seller, 
fll) Hutl^, stammerer. 

(12) Khfiugar, Jchdnsi, a cough. 

(13) Lahu, charred or burnt. 

(14) To pa, bought for a topd or 2 

seers of grain. 

(15) Kumhar, potter. 

(16) Naul, 7ieoZ(i. 

(17) Pathrala, founded by a leaf- 

seller {pattdj leaf). 



(3) Nila, blue. 



* Bauhtia appears to be a variant of Bahti. Possibly, this suggests, Bahti means simply 
'ploughman.' 

t According to the account of the Ghirths compiled by the late Mr. A H. Gunter, C.S., the 
Brahminica'- gotras de preserved but each comprises a number of als, e.g., the Kundal got(ra) 
includes the Chang, Sial, Thetar and Tholi zdts (= als), the Konsal got includes the 
Panihari, the Tul got the Pataku al, and the Kasab the Katt i. The gots, it is distinctly 
stated, are named after common ancestors ' who were n's/its.'

D.— (1) Khera, founded by a woman whose child was born undor a 
hher tree. 

(2) Banyanu, founded by a woman whoso child was born under a 

han or oak. 

(3) Dadda, founded by a woman whose child was born near a 

bamboOj and laid on the tree. 

(4) Khunld,, an animal of some kind. The name was given to a 

child as a token of affection. Hence his descendants are 
still called by the name. 

(5) Ladhdri^, from ladhdr, a kind of tree. 

(6) Ghurl, a wild goat ; so called because its progenitor cried like 

one. 

(7) Khajurd, date-palm (c/. the Nagarko^ia Brahman al of this 
name) ; so-called because its founder was born under a date- 
palm. 

(8) Khatta, from khattdf a kind of tree : for a similar reason. 

Other exogamous sections {gots) are Bahiru, Banjiira, Barol, 
Chakotra, Bhut, Didlu, Hangaria, Jalnrich, Kathc, Narotra, Panjla, 
Panyiu, Panyaria, Sd^kre, Sial, Thimbu, Thirku, etc., all of unknown 
derivation. 

In the Rajput hypergamous system the Ghirth does not rank very 
high for not till the seventh generation can his daughter become a 
queen [Satwin 'pirhi Ghirthni ki dhl Rani hojdti), whereas the Rathi'a 
daughter can attain to that position in four generations and even the 
Kanet's reaches it in five. But the Rd^jas could pi'omote a Ghirth to 
be a Rdthi, as Sir James Lyall records (Kdngra Sett. Rep., § 73), 

The following accounts of the Ghirth social observances are given 
as typical of the usaj^es among all the Hindu castes of the Kangra Hills 
and not as peculiarly characteristic of the Ghirths. They resemble 
generally tnose in vogue among the Gaddis of Kd,ngra, but the local 
variations appear to be endless. These are described in the foot-notes 
to the text below — 

In betrothal the father, mother or uncle, if alive, will tell the youth 
to arrange to marry such and such a girl. If these are not alive, he 
chooses himself; otherwise he remains passive throughout the arrange- 
ments. The father then finds a go-between {nibdrii) who goes to the 
girl's parents and makes the pro|30sal to them. If they accept, a day 
is arranged for the ceremony of betrothal {natd). On this day the 
rTlhdrii conducts the boy's father or other guardian (the boy does not 
go as a rule*) to the girl's house. Ho takes with him cream, delii, in a 

* Provided the father has no infirmity rendering the son's assistance necessary, the son 
will not accompany him. Ho will generally accompany any other guardian. If the boy 
goes too, he is allowed to stay at the girl's parents' house if the Brahmans declare the 
occasion favourable, otherwise he must slay in some other house, llie boy's Brahman 
may be one of the p irty. It makes a point of arriving during the particular wat h of the 
particular day which the Brahman has found to be propitious. He leads the way in, 
followed by the father and next relative. The others stay in the enclosure outside. The 
things are put down and a rupee in silver and a half anna bit in copper are placed by the 
boy's father in the moveable shrine (called iZitta dcra) of Gancsh on the freshly plastered 
chaukah. At tiio same time the girl's parents put down a tray containing a little yur of 



200 Ghirth weddings. 

clay vessel {dehdli), grain, gur and clothes for the girl, and two rupees 
two pice in cash (and jewels, if rich enough) ; and if a price for the 
girl has been agreed upon, they take that too. When they get to the 
house they find a ghard of water and an oil-lamp and a vessel contain- 
ing a little gur and ghi in the girPs parents' house, and her parents 
waiting for them, but not the girl herself. They put down the grain, 
gur and dehi, rupees and pice, and clothes and jewels by the water in a 
wicker basket put ready for them, and no one speaks a word. Square 
mats made of suorarcane stalks are placed for the deputation. When 
they hitve set c'own the grain, etc., the boy's party bow with joined 
hands to the lamp and water- vessel, and dipping their fingers into the 
grir and ghi put them in their mouths. Then the boy's party salam 
and the girl's pnrty salam, and then all sit down for the first time. 
Then the g;o-between takes the rupees and pice and clothes to the girl 
who is with the women in another room, gives the money to her, and 
gets down the clothes. Then the riiharu comes back, and receiving 
the girl's price from the boy's father, gives it to the girl's father. 
Then the boy's father gives pice to the girl's party's kamins, i. e., the 
barber, the parohit (family Brahman) and the watchman. The boy's 
party stays till night, when the girl's party entertain him with a meal. 
Then the girl's mother calls in other women of the village, and they 
sing and the boy's father gives them pice. Next day the boy's party 
having breakfasted return home. 

From this time until the wedding, which in the case of a virgin is called 
hidh, the boy's father sends once a year rice or maize, cream, gur and 
clothes for the girl. The person who brings these gifts is entertained 
at night by the girl's parents and goes away the next day. The date 
of the wedding is arranged by the girl's father.* It may take place 

their own. The boy's father puts a half anna in this and tastes the gur. He puts a pice 
in the lota of water (garivi) before the shrine, touches his forehead and bends down to 
Gan6sh, the girl's Brahman worshipping all the time in the usual way. The girl's mother 
puts the jewelry on the girl, and the ceremony is over. The girl's parents take all the 
things brouo;ht, including the rupee and pice, into the shrine in the tray, out of which the 
girl's mother takes them, and not the girl's father. It is the mother's right. There is a 
feast next morning and pice are distributed to the poor, and a few annas to the Brahman, 
the dhdi of the girl's family and the local watchman. A few pice are also given to the 
girl's sisters, if any, and her other female relations. 

* The boy's family Brahman settles the day. About 20 days before the day fixed the 
father takes him to the house of the skirl's parents, where there is a consultation between 
him and their Brahman as to whether the day fixed is also auspicious for the father, 
paternal uncle and brother of the boy and girl respectively. 

The girl's father puts some rice and gur and a few blades of drub grass and two pice, 
and the boy's father also one anna in copper, into a tray. These are divided by the two 
Brahmans who throw out the grass. In the tray the girl's mother also puts the red paste 
for making the tika on the forehead which is used for all religious occasions, except these 
connected with death. The girl's Brahman puts the tika on the boy's father's forehead and 
then on the foreheads of a few of the bystanders. Both families then make their prepara* 
tions and summon their friends and relations to the wedding. 

On the day the boy's party, whif-h always includes the Brahman and the family barber, 
goes to the girl's house, the boy being carried in a pdlki and musicians accompanying. The 
boy is dressed in red with a fringe of silk tassels (sera) bound round his turban and 
hanging in front of his face. He has been washed and dressed by the barber before 
starting. The sera and a pair of shoes and a coat are given him by the boy's maternal 
uncle When the party reaches the girl's house they all wait outside until the girl's 
Brahman announces that the auspicious moment (the conjunction of two stars, ' lagan ') has 
arrived. The boy and his Brahman with the barber and a friend who has the custody of 
the money for current expenditure go inside. The chauhah with the diwa dera is ready. The 
friend puts a rupee and half anna in the shrine while the Bralunans mutter a few words. 



Ghirth weddings. 291 

when tho girl is 7 years old oven ; there is no limit of age. When tho 
date of tho wedding is fixed tho boy's fatlier givea whatever it was 
arranged shouki be then paid, and both parties make p-eparations for 
it. Oil tho wedding day the boy is shavcl, waslied with b"tnd to rnakft 
him clean and dressed in a kwah (red cholu.) and a red' r">gri, red 
paijdmds and kaviarhand and sera (t;isselled head-dress). Mehipii (the 
plant) is put into his hand to make his fingers red, and he is put info 
a pdlki and taken to tlie girl's house. The girl's fat 1 1 er's waiii there 
spreads a cloth. On this cloth tho two fathers meet. The gii-l's father 
then gives the boy's father's nain pice, and the boy's father does the 
like to the other nain. This is called awdrinda or in Punjabi lodranda 
because each of the fathers waves the pice round tho head of the other 
before giving them to the barbers. This takes place outside the house. 
Then the girl's party takes tlio boy into the house. Then the girl's 
parohit reads the Ved mantar over the couple. Then they go into the 
salin and put four poles previously adorned into the ground, and place 
others joining their tops. Tho boy and girl arc then set underneath, 
and more mantars are read. Then the jjirl and boy walk four times 
round the poles with their clothes tied together [Unjri). The marriage 
ceremony is now complete. Then the parties feast at the bride's 
house, but the women are not present. Then behind the pardd the 
bride's head is anointed with chaunh. Then either on that day or the 
next the bridegroom takes the bride to his father's house, if it is near 
enough. Perhaps tho girl's barber and the midwife may accompany 



The girl's mother takes tho rupee and half anna. A blanket is spread inside the outer 
room. The boy and girl sit facing each other on it with the boy's barber supporting him 
and the girl's barber's wife supporting her, and the respective Brahmans facing each other 
on the two other sides. Both read the service. The barber's wife puts the boy's cloak over 
the pair and the barber lifts the .sera from his face and tho barber's wife her cloak from 
the girl's, so that they can see each other. The boy takes the ring off the little finger of his 
right hand and puts it on the little finger of the girl's right hand. The cloak over the pair 
is removed and tho girl's face hidden again. Some gwr mixed with p/u' is put by the girl's 
mother in a tray and the boy takes some, after which the barber's wife gives some to the 
girl. The friend with the money bag puts two pice into the tray. These are taken by the 
barber's wife. The boy comes out to his relations and the girl goes into the inner room 
among the women. After all have refreshed themselves four sticks with small cross-sticks 
at the top are fixed in the ground in tho enclosure to form a small square in which 5 or 6 
can sit. The barber's wife makes a figure {chaunh) with flour on the ground and a small 
heap of grain at each of the two points marked with a cross, and these heaps are covered 
with baskets. The boy sits on one basket, and the girl on the other supported by their 
Brahmans, the barber and his wife, respectively, the Brahmans being further off than the 
barber and his wife. A fire is lit at the point marked with a double cross. The Brahmans 
put rice soaked in water and ghi on the fire. The girl's mother brings a tray containing a 
little rice and a UUl filled with water and puts them down • by her Brahman in worship. 
He throws soaked rice over them and gives them to the boy's Brahman, who puts them iii 
front of the boy. The girl's mother or father then brings another tray with a little rice 
in it and an empty basket and puts them down by Ihe girl's Brahmaii, and the girl's 
parents put into the tray whatever jewelry tliey intend to give to their daughter, and 
the Brahman hands the tray to the boy's Hraliman, who puts the jewelry down in front of 
the boy and returns the tray to the girl's Brahman. 

Friends and relations are then called to bring their presents, and they put money in the 
tray, which is then offered to the girl by her Brahman. The girl takes out as much as she 
can with two hands, and this is handed over to the boy's Brahman. The remainder in the 
tray belongs to the girl's parents. In the same way presents of cloth are put in the basket 
and these belong to the girl's parents Next morning the barber and larber's wife again 
show the couple's faces to each other under the cloak as before ; but this time they are 
sitting on the two baskets, and the girl has all the jewelry on. The boy puts another ring 
on the girl's finger. They separate again as before, and the ceremonies are over. In the 
evening the girl will be taken ofl in a falhi, the boy preceding her in his fdlU. 



292 GMrth inheritance, 

her, but none of her other people. The bride and bridegroom are 
brought into the house and are set before a Hghted lamp and ghara of 
water to which they bow with hands joined. They are then given ghi 
and gitr to eat, and the bridegroom's marriage garments are taken off. 
Then the bridegroom takes the bride to his mother. Then the bride, 
the barber, the midwife and the people who have carried the bride's 
gifts (given by the bride's parents) and the Kahdrs are feasted, and 
the next day they take the bride home again. If she is not of age, 
she sleeps with her mother-in-law. If she has attained puberty, she 
sleeps in a separate room with her husband. Then two or three 
months later the bridegroom goes to his father-in-law's house and 
brings her to his father's house again (/iarp/^cra), and she remains 
there, unless the girl's parents send for her again. 

The reading of the mantars (lagan) and the going round the poles 
(ghumdna) are the binding and essential parts of the ceremony. Some- 
times wh' n the girl's parents are dead the purchase- money is paid and 
the marriage completed by the observance of these two ceremonies 
alone. 

A bride-price is paid, but its amount is not fixed. No regard is 
had to the poverty or wealth of the bridegroom. The older the gu-l, 
the more is paid for her. The greater the necessity of the bridegroom, 
i. e., the more difficulty he experiences in getting a wife, the more he 
must pay, e. g., if he is a widower. 

Widow remarriage is common. Indeed as divorce or rather sale of 
wives is frequent* both widows and divorcees remarry. They go 
through the simple ceremony called jhanjrdrd or widow remarriage, 
which consists in the priest putting a red cloak over each party and 
knotting the corners together as they sit on a newly plastered 
spot [chaunkah) outside the husband's house. The priest then leads 
the way in, the woman and the man following him in that order. 
Both then do obeisance at the small shrine to Ganesh with its offerings 
of a lota of water and lamp {chirdgh) placed outside, and the ceremony 
is over. Before the cloaks are knotted a nose-ornament of gold given 
by the husband is taken by the woman from the hands of the barber's 
wife and put on. This ornament is the common sign of marriage. 

The Ghirths generally think the younger brother has a right to 
claim the elder brother's widow, but the claim is not enforceable, nor 
apparently ever was. The elder brother cannot marry the younger 
brother's widow, but the Ghirths of Pd,lampur say that it is done in the 
K^ngra tahsil. 

Ghirths follow the Hindu law of inheritance, but, it is said, all 
the sons inherit according to the rule of chun^dvand, i. e., all the 
sons by one wife get as much as all those by another wife.t But 



* Divorce is permitted at the pleasure of the husband ; under no circumstances can the 
wife claim divorce against his will. It is called chhodni. If a wife be unfaithful, the 
abductor pays the husband the price of her hartan (lit. ' user ') in the presence of witnesses 
and receives a bill of divorce. There is no ceremony. The jhanjrdrd takes place with 
another man. 

t The Gaddis who live south of the Ravi and are called Chanoti also follow this rule. 
Those of Brahmaur observe the fagvand rule. In other words the cMnddvand rule is a 

local 911Q, 



OMrth funerals. 293 

when the property is divided the oldest son will get some weapon or a 
head of cattle or a plot of land, with the consent of the brothers, in 
token of his being the head of tho family. The rest of the immoveable 
property will be divided equally. Thatj which is given in this way_ to 
the eldest brother is called jetMmda. 

A Ghirth can adopt any boy of his own tribe, preferably one 
descended from an ancestor of his own. If after the adoption a son 
be born to the adopter, the adopted son will receive a share equal to 
that of a natural son. If after the adoption offspring be born from 
a number of wives, then first the share of tho adopted son will be set 
apart by the rule oFpagva?irZ; tho remainder of the property being 
divided by chunddvand. 

At Ghirth funerals there is always an Acharj Brahman. When the 
deceased is laid on the pyre (salbi) the Brahman reads prayers and 
then the heir puts the pind or balls of rice on tfie forehead and breast 
of the deceased. The fire is then lighted. For ten days after the 
Brahman comes and reads mantars, and pind is thrown down the kha4 
or ravine daily. The ceremony of srcidh is performed on — 

(a) The anniversaries of the death of the father, grandfather, and 
great-grandfather and their collaterals and are thus observ- 
ed : — A Brahman (not an Achdrj) is called in and makes the 
pind. The observer the.n places rice, pice, cloth, etc., by 
the find, which the Brahman gets. The pind is finally 
thrown into water. The Brahman reads the mantars, and a 
feast is celebrated. This is done yearly. On the first an- 
niversary (bdrkhi) and the fourth [chauharkh) there is a 
special celebration when all the Brahmans of the village 
must be feasted, and the entertainment is costly. 

(6) The suppind (next-of-kin) performs these funeral ceremonies 
and commemorations when there is no son, just as if he 
were a son. The hirid takes place for Ghirths 22 days after 
the death in all cases. Then besides the balls of rice for 
each ancestor of the deceased a large ball is made which is 
broken up by the Achd,rj Brahman and added to tho other 
balls. This is called supindta. 

(c) When a man dies a violent death, there are two Jcirids — one in 
the heir^s house and another, the nardin bal, which takes 
place at tho Ganges, at Kuruchhetar (in Karn:ll) or at 
Matan in Kashmir or at tho houso of any of the family 
who can afford it. This at Matan always takes place in 
tho month of Malmas (Lend). At the nardin bal there is no 
supindta. 

It cannot be said that the Ghirths have any distinctive belief 
or special caste cults.* They affect: (1) Jakh, really a form of Shiv 
in the form of a stone, only without the jaleri and generaly 
placed among bushes. This is common to all Hindus owning cattle. 
The milch cattle are devoted to particular jakhs and offerings 
made for them to their particular jakhs when the cattle calve. Any 

* Malaghat is said to bo the ' placo in the Deccan ' whence the Ghirths and their deotd 
(godling) came, and also their god's name. Ajiipiil, a tree god, is also mentioned, and 
sainath ' the]|.lamp of Gosain.' 



294 Ghirth cults, 

one may present the offerings, and those who live near the jaJeh 
take it — in the case of jakhs in the waste the gwdla who happens to be 
grazing cattle near. 

(2) Ndg or snake worship. Every house or collection of houses 
has its rough platform about throe feet high, with a few pillars support- 
ing a thatch, in the enclosure and containing a few flat stones like thin 
bricks, with reliefs of one or more snakes cut on them side by side, head 
upwards. This must be worshipped, the first thing in the morning, by 
every one, by pouring a little water over the stones. Flowers are also 
to be seen on them and on the similar reliefs of ancestors which will be 
found under the same shelter. Tuesday is the special day of the week 
for this worship. The special yearly worship of the snake is on the 5th 
of Sd,wan (N% i^anchmi). All the available milk for the seven preced- 
ing days is collected, and on the 5th Sawan rice is boiled in it. A 
chaukah is made inside and outside the tlireshold with three efiSgies of 
snakes on each, white, red and black — the white of flour, the red of 
clay, the black of charcoal. Then follows the usual worship, first with 
water, then rice, then with a red tika on the snake's and the worshipper's 
own forehead, and incense. The milk is afterwards distributed. If 
there are women in the house, they will do this worship and not the 
men. In default of women, the men. Also at the time of the worship 
two boys are made to wrestle after giving them as much as they can 
eat of the things offered. Then they are dismissed with a few pice. 
This is a test. If the boys go away happy, the god is pleased ; if not, 
he is incensed. But this snake worship is not peculiar to the Ghirths. 

(3) The Sidhs. — The Sidhs are shrines to Sidhs, i, e., seers, scattered 
over the country. The most noted is Dewat Sidh, whose chief sbrine 
is in the Hamirpur tahsil. Either a small shrme or merely a pillar 
is devoted to a representation in relief in stone of the feet of the Sidh 
and his staff by the feet ; or it may be merely under the shade of a tree 
and sometimes very roughly cut. A small pair of toy pattens and a toy 
staff may also be seen lying by the relief. In some cases there is a 
figure of the Sidli in the shrine. Sidh worship is very general, though 
particular men may choose not to follow it. It is not confined to 
Ghirths. The Sidh is worshipped every morning like the other house- 
hold gods or at least on Sunday. This is the Sidh's day in the week. 
When crops are ripening the shrine of the nearest Sidh is visited on 
Sunday. Sidhs are supposed to be special protectors of boys. Ghirths 
generally wear the singhi or silver ornament at the throat, which is a 
mark of devotion to a Sidh in the district, but the Ghirths say that it 
does not specially appertain to a Sidh and may be worn as a mark of 
devotion to any deity. 

Ghirth women worship the pipal tree, so far only as to pour water 
over it on the death of a child. On the 14th day of the moon, i. e,, at 
full moon, only sweet food is to be eaten and one must sleep on the 
ground. When the moon is seen water is poured out to it standing. 

Occasionally one to whom a Brahman has said that the sun is in 
opposition to him will set apart the last Sunday of every month, eat 
sweet food only, sleep on the ground, and pour out water to the sun 
early next morning. 



GJiogha — Ghoreivuha. 295 

Very occasionally a man becomes possessed, which is shewn by 
contortions. The evil spirit may be exorcised by the charms of a 
Brahman or there is a temple near Saloh village, at which there is a 
spot, the earth of which has a peculiar virtue. The mdhant of the 
temple, who is a Ghirth, pours some water over a little of the earth and 
makes the possessed one eat it, and puts an untwisted thread round his 
neck. 

Before commencing to plough a Brahman must bo consulted as to 
the propitious day and the iron of the share is sometimes worshipped. 
Also as to sowing to find out from a Brahman which particular sort of 
grain it will be propitious to sow first. A Httle of the particular sort is 
sown according to the augury. 

Gbirths sacrifice a goat in the first field which ripens in the village 
in order to propitiate the gods and prevent disasters, such as hail, etc. 
In case of cattle-disease the wooden part of the plough-share is set up 
in the enclosure of the house and marked with red and black spots or 
tikas in order that the disease may be averted. Some Ghirths say it is 
done by a chela or other special person who knows how, and is intended, 
to keep away evil spirits (bhiits). 

Besides the Diw^li, Lohri and Dasehra the Ghirths observe tlie fol- 
lowing festivals : — 

The Birru on 1st Baisdkh. It consists in distributing earthen water 
vessels [gharas) to Brahman s and married daughters. 

The Sairu on 1st Asauj. It consists in cooking bread and distributing 
it just as at the Lohri. It lasts all day, and marks the ends of the 
rains. 

The Nauld. marks the harvesting of the spring crop. Bread is cooked 
and eaten and distributed, and those who did not give the gharas at 
the Birru do so now. 

Ghirth women wear an ear ornament called dhStfii, The Nd,i or 
barber plays a special trumpet called a nafiri for Ghirths only. It is 
exactly like an English bed-room candle-stick with two handles opposite 
each other inside instead of outside the rim. Ghirths dance at wed- 
dings and festivals facing alternately in different directions and 
bending their raised arms inwards and outwards. 

Ghogha, a Mahtam clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Qhorewaha, a tribe of Riijputs whose head-quarters are the Jullundur 
district, of which they occupy the eastern corner, but they are found in 
smaller numbers in all the adjoining districts. To the west of them are 
the Manj, and to the north of them the Ndru. They are almost all 
Musalman. They are Kachwaha Rajputs of the Gosal got, descendants 
of Kash, the second son of Rama. They say that Riija Man,"^' sixth in 
descent from Kash, had two sons, Kachwaha andHawaha, and that they 
are of the lineage of Hawdha. The two brothers met Shahiib-ud-din 
Ghori (!) with an offering of a horse, and received in return as large a 
territory as they could ride round in a day ; hence their name. 'I'ho 
division of their country took place while they were yet Hindus, so that

their settlement in their present tract was probably an early one. The 
Ghorew^ha of Kdhon, who are still Hindus^ would seem to have im- 
migrated more lately than the rest of the tribe, as they trace their 
origin from Jaipur, and their genealogists still live in Kota and Bundi 
in Rcljputdna. Mr. Barkley was disposed to put the Ghorewdha 
conquest of their present territory at some five centuries ago. In the 
time of Akbar their possessions would seem to have been more extensive 
than they are now. 

In Hoshiarpur the Ghorewdha hold a hdwani or group of 52 villages 
around BaMchaur in tahsil Garhshankar ; near Balachaur they have 
adhered to Hinduism ; farther north, in the direction of Garhshankar, 
they are Musalniiins, but they keep Hindu Brahmans and bards, to 
whom they give presents at deaths and marriages, and retain various 
other Hindu customs. 

The descendants of Hawdha founded 9 chhat or principal villages and 
12 mahdn^ (the latter a,re said to be derived from men of inferior 
position to those who founded chhat), and are also divided into 12 
muhins named after 12 of the 13 sons of Uttam. The Ghorewdha also 
have tika villages, e. g., Bhaddi is the tiha of the 1 2 Ghorewaha villages 
round it. Another account says the Ghorewaha presented a river 
horse {darydi ghora) to the ruler of the country and obtained the 
country in jdgir, whence their present name.t 

The chhat in Hoshidrpur are four, viz., Garhshankar, Pundm, Saroa, 
and SimlijJ all in tahsil Garhshankar, the remaining 5 being in the 
Jullundur district. There are two makdns, Samundra and Bir^mpur 
in this tahsil. 

The Ghorewaha Rajputs only avoid marriage in their own got and 
with a girl of the same locality {muhin). Muhammadan Ghorewahas 
have a further restriction, in that they will not take brides from a 
village in which daughters are given in marriage, but intermarriage 
withm the village is not forbidden. The Ghorewahas of Garhshankar 
and Rahon are said to give daughters to N^ru Rdjputs. These, and the 
other chhats, take brides from, but do not give daughters to, makdn 
villages. 

Ghorgasht, Ghdegrdshti, one of the great branches of the Pathdns, 
descended from Ismail, surnamed Ghorghasht, one of the three sons 
of Qais-i-Abd-ur-Rashid the Patd,n. Ismail had three sons, Ddnai 
[who had four sons, Kaka?, Panai (Panni), Naghab and Ddwai (Dawi)]. 
Mandu, and Bdliai, the ancestor of the Bahi Afghans of Kandahar. The 
tribes descended from Danai are by far the most numerous and include 
many of the most powerful tribes of jSouth-Eastern Afghanistan, 
Ghorgasht is said to mean 'leaping and jumping,' 'playing and 
romping/ and to have been bestowed upon Ismail as a nickname. 

Ghobi, a Mughal clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 



* For these chhat and mnhdn compare the mandis and dheris among the Chibh Bajputs. 

t A variant, from Kapnrtha'a, says that once a bippopotamus covered a mare. The 
progeny was presented to Akbar who rode round the land afterwards covered by 1,840 
villages. He cast his spear and it fell at Silanwali. 

J The Simli Ghorewaua do not give daughters to those of Garbshankar, the latter 
being descendants of the elder (tika) brother, Rfip Chand.

Ghoria^-Ghugiat. 297 

Ghoria or Ghwaria Khel, the Ghwari sept or branch of the Pathilns. 
It comprised five tribes, the Mohmands, Khalils, D.-iudzais, Chamkanni 
and Zeriini. It was the rival of the Khashi branch and its enmity 
drove tho latter to abandon its old seats round Nushki and Ghara and 
seek refuge in the territory of the Gigiani Patlulns near Kdliul. Uzbek 
inroads however and the breaking up of the Timurid- dynasty of Kho- 
rd,sdn drove the Ghwaria themselves to the northward, the Ddudzais 
soliciting lands from the Khashis near Peshawar, while the Khalils and 
Mohmands obtained considerable power in that valley by allying 
themselves with Mirzd Kd,mrd,n who then held Kd,bul in fief under hia 
brother Humdyun. With his aid these two Ghwaria clans suddenly 
attacked the Dilazdks and wrested from them the lands they still 
held south of the Kdbul river, about 1533-34. On Kd,mran's fall 
however their power declined and their defeat by the great Khashi 
confederation at Shaikh Tapur in 1549-50 crushed the power of the 
Ghwaria Khel for ever. For accounts of the Ghoria tribes see Khalil, 
etc., and under Para Chamkanni. 

Ghosi, fem. -an, a caste of people who work as grass-cutters and sell 
milk in the United Provinces ; but the name also appears to be applied 
indiscriminately to any low caste Purbia. 'fhe term is said to be only 
used in the Punjab for a Muhammadan cowherd or milkman, whether 
Gujar, Ahir or any o^her caste ; but there are Hindu Ghosis in Delhi 
who are gicdlas or cowtierds by calling and appear to be by origin 
Ahirs. It is said that Hindus will buy pure milk from a Musalm^m Ghosi, 
but will reject it if there is any suspicion of its having been watered by 
the latter, as they must not drink water at his hands ! The Ghosis 
are a purely pastoral group, at any rate in the Punjab. They are, 
however, sometimes butchers. 

The Muhammadan Ghosis in Delhi are called Gaddi-Ghosis, and those 
of Delhi city have a curious legend that they were once invited by 
the disciples of a saint to rescue him from a Rjija's tyranny. This 
they did, though only armed with sticks and clubs, and as their reward 
the saint gave them gowns and doshdlds to wear, with green dnchals 
(veils) for their women, but the latter are no longer in fashion. Still the 
men continue to wear a pair of nnder-kurtas or shirts. The women do not 
U30 the lahnga and kuHa or petticoat and shift like other Ghosi 
women. These Gliosis are strictly eudogamous, and a woman of any 
other caste kept by a Ghosi is denied all social intercourse with the 
caste, and her partner is not directly invited to feasts or weddings, 
though he can attend them if other members of his family do so. 
As these Ghosis protected the saint's gaddl or seat they oarae to be 
called Gaddi-Ghosi. The Gaddi-Ghosis of Firoz^bdd are also Muhara- 
raadans, though they claim to be Gaddis from Kdngra, and they certainly 
have no intercourse with those of Delhi city. They observe parda and 
are generally strict Moslems. 

GnoTTa, Ghotu, a polisher or pounder. 

Gbowal, a sept of Rajputs, descended from Midn Sainki, son of Sangar 
Chand, 16th Rdjd of Kahlur. 

Ghdq, Ghdqiat, tv7o agricultural claas found in Shdhpor, 



298 . Ohulam—'Qihdri. 

Ghdlam. — These men are found in the Peshawar district under the 
name of Ghuldm-khanazd,d,* and in Multd,n under that of Kh^nazdd 
simply. The latter may, however, be an error for Khanzadah. 
The Pesluiwar clans are given as Turkhel Ghul^m, and Malekhel. 
They are said to be descendants of captives in war who were made 
plave>* (ghulnm), whence their name. They are still chieSy employed in 
domestic service, and are generally attached to their hereditary masters, 
though some of them have taken to shopkeeping and other occupations. 
In Peshawar the men are also called mnn and the women winza 
(concubine). In Bah^walpur the Ghulam are a small tribe, slaves of 
the Ghallus. 

Ghdmman, Ghamman, atribeofJdts, found in Si^lkot. It claims descent from 
Malkir, second in descent from the Lunar Rdjput, R^ja Dalip of Delhi. 
Fifth in descent from him, Jodha had three sons, Harpd^l, Ranpdl and 
Sanpdl. The descendants of the two former are the Hajaulif Rajputs, 
while Sanpdl had 22 sons, from whom are descended as many clans, 
including Ghumman, the youngest. Sanpal's wives were of various castes 
and so his children sank to Jat status. Their Brahmans are Bharwdkirs, 
whom Muhammadans also consult. Ghumman came from Mukiala or 
Malhid,na in the time of Firoz Shd-h, took service in Jammu, and 
founded the present tribe. At weddings they worship an idol made of 
grass and set within a square drawn in the corner of the honse, and 
cut the goat's ear and the jandX twig like the Sdhi Jd,t8. They also 
propitiate their ancestors by pouring water over a goat's head so that 
ho shakes it off. They are chiefly found in Sidikot, though they have 
spread somewhat, especially eastwards, and in that District they have a 
Sidh called Dulchi. In Jind their Sidhis called Dadii or Kala, and his 
samddh is at Nagra in Patiala. Beestings are offered to him on the 
11th hadi every month : offerings are also made at weddings. 

GiANi, fern. -AN, one possessed of knowledge, especially one versed in the 
traditional interpretation of the Sikh Granth. 

GlARU, a sept or khel of Rd,jputs in the Simla Bills. To it belong the chiefs 
of Kot Khdi, Kumlid,rsain, Khaneti, Karangal and Delath. Said to be 
derived from Gayd,, whence it came. 

Also a sept of Brahmans of similar origin, founded by a Brahman 
who married a Hill Brahman's daughter. 

GiBAEi, GiBARi, Gabari. — According to Raverty§ Gabar was a town in Ba- 
jaur and the Gibaris were the ruling race in that tract, speaking a dia- 
lect different from the other tribes. The Afghdn historian describes the 
people with whom the Afghd.ns first came in contact in those parts as 
speaking two dialects, the Gibari, spoken by that tribe, and the Dari, 
spokenbytheMutriwiandMumiali.il The Gibari, with the two last- 
named tribes, were septs of the Shilmani. See also Gabare, Gabr and 
Gaur. 

* Muhammad Hayat Kban in his Haiydt-i- Afghani states that the Qizilbash of Kabul 
are collectively known as Ghulam-khana, and possibly some of the Ghulam-kh4nazad 
may be Qizilbash.

Gidri—Gil. ' 299 

GiDRi, Gedri, doubtless from gidar, ' jackal.' Reputed immigrants from 
Hindustan and Bikanor, the Gidris are now found mainly in tlip Baha- 
walpur State. Closely resembling the S^nsis of the Punjab Proper, 
who look down upon thera, the Gidris are split up into various camps, 
which are supposed to meet once a year in SJiwan at Tulla Darya Khdn 
in Khd.n Bela police-station in Baliawalpur. There all tribal disputes 
are settled, just as is done among the Stinsis. The Gidi is live by labour, 
but also make baskets, cages, fans, etc., and sometimes hawk knives 
and cheap jewelry for sale. Each camp has its own headman who exer- 
cises quasi-ju(\\cm\ authority in it. The women journey direct from 
one camping-place to the next, while the men go further afield in 
. search of work. Nominally Hindus the Gidris will eat the H' sh of any 
■ animal and are regarded as outcasts. The dead are buried without 
any obsequies. Marriage is always effected within the tribe, generally 
by exchange, but failing that a bride can be purchased for Hs. 15. No 
rites are observed save an announcement of the union before relatives. 
They speak a language of their own which is allied to the dialects of 
Bikdner and Jaisalmer. 

GiGiANi, Gaqiani, a Khashi Pa^lian tribe, descended frt.m Mak, the 
third son of Khashai. According to one tradition Mak has two sods, 
Hotak and Jirak, and a daughter Gagai or Gagai, whom he gave in mar- 
riage to a shepherd. As she had espoused a man of low degree her 
descendants styled themselves Gagiani. Another tradition makes their 
progenitor a foundling, who was adopted by Mukai, son of Khashai, 
and married to Gagai, a daughter of Tur, the Tarin. By her he had 
two sons, Hotak and Jirak, and from their seven sons are rJescendo"! as 
many Gagiani clans. Mukai's OAvn descendants are known as the 
Mukah Khel. Originally settled in territory near Kabul, the Gigianis, 
despite their alliance with the Muglials of Mirza Ulugh Beg, were over- 
thrown by the Yusufzai Pathd.ns in the Ghwara Maigha,* near Kabul, 
Soon after they made an ineffectual attempt to es^tablish themselves in 
Bajaur, and then besought the Yusufzais and Mandars to grant them 
lands in the Doaha in the Peshawar valley. Speedily, however, they 
intrigued against their benefactors and in 1519 also called in Babar to 
aid them against the Dilazdks, but their internal dissensions led him to 
suspect treachery and ho left them to face the Dilazdks, by whom they 
were completely vanquished. Nevertheless in the great reiiistribution 
of Khashi territory which followed the overthrow of the Ghwaria Khel 
the Gigianis received half Bajaur, Ambar, Nawagai and Chharmang, 
in addition to the Doaba. 

Gil, one of the largest and most important of the Jdt tribes. Its main set- 
tlements are in the Lahore and Ferozepur divstricts ; but it is found all 
along the Bids and Upper Sutlej, and under the hills as far west as Sialko^. 
Gil its ancestor, and the father of Slier Gil,t was a Jat of Raghobansi 
Rajput descent who lived in the Ferozepur district ; he was a lineal

She bore him a son, but his three Rijput wives replaced him by a stone, and bad him 

abandoned in a forest. But Pirthipat, when out huuting, found him with a lion and 

brought him homa. As he was found in h marshy (gilt) place ho was named Sher Oil !

descent^ani; of Pirtlnpalj Raja of Garh Mithila and a Waria Eajput, 
by a Bhular Jat wife. The tribe rose to some importance under the 
Sikhs, and the history of its principal family is told at pages 352 ff 
of GrifBn^s Panjah Chiefs. 

Two pedigrees of Gil are given below. He had 12 sons who founded 
as many muhins : — 

Sobhru, Jaj, Talocharu, Kesaria, Chhaj, Jiuna, Bahawara, Wadhan,

Gil. 

The Gils worship their eponym on the Chet Chaudas at Rajidna, 
in Moga tahsii, where he has a temple. He also appears to be called 
R^i^ Pir and to be specially affected by the Wairsi Gils. In Jind 
their /ai^tera is Surat Ram, whose shrine is at Bajewd,la in Patidla and 
offerings to which are taken by Mirasis. In Ferozepor the tribe is said to 
affect Sakhi Sarwar and its men prefer to be called Dipa, Sarupa, etc., 
instead of Dip Singh, Sarup Singh, and so on, with the title of *Mian* 
prefixed. At weddings they dig earth from the pond of Sakhi Sarwar 
near their home. They eschew jhatka meat, but will eat it if haldl, like 
Muhammadans. When some of the tribe took to eating the flesh 
of animals killed in the Sikh fashion by jhatka, one lost his eyes, 
another found himself in jail, and so on, so they reverted to their former 
practice.

Gildni-^Golera. 301 

The Gil, like the Her and Sidhu Jdts can intermarry in thuir 
maternal grandfather's got, contrary to the usual Hindu rule. A Gil 
bridegroom cuts a branch from the jand tree before setting out on his 
wedding journey. 

GiLANi, a Sayyid clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar and Montgomery ; 
see Jild-ni. 

GiK, a Muhammadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

GiRWANH, a Muhammadan Jut clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 
Jn Balulwalpur they are also called Garwunh and are found as land- 
owners and cultivators in the Bahawalpur and Ahmadpur Kdrddris 
with three septs^ Attu, Jalap and Karer. 

GiSHKAPEi, a Baloch tribe, now found scattered in Dora Ismdil, Muzaffar- 
garh and Montgomery ; also in Mekritn. Apparently derived from 
Gishkaur, a torrent in the Boheda valley of Mekran. The Lashari 
s\ih-tu7nan has a Gishkauri sept and the Dombki a clan of that namo. 
In Montgomery the Gishkauri is listed as an agricultural cian. 

GoDARA, a prosperous clan of Jats, of the Shib^otra group, found in 
Hissdr, where it owns large areas in Sirsa and Fatehabad tahsils. They 
trace their descent from Nirabuji, who founded a village near Bikaner, 
and say that as they could not aarce upon one of their own clan as 
chieftain they asked the Raja of Jodhpur to give them one of his 
younger sons as iheir ruler, so he g:ave them Bikii in whose honour 
Bikdner was founded. To this day, it is said, the rdj-tilah is marked 
on the forehead of a new Rdja of Bikaner by a Godara Jat, and not by 
the family priest. 

GoHA?,, a Gujar clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

GoHRA, a 5'kt tribo found in Jind tahsil. Its eponym is said to have been a 
Tur Rajput. 

Goj, a Jd,t clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

GoKHA, a Mahtam clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

GoLAH, a weaver, in Peshawar. There are Gola groups or classes amono* 
the Jdlahas, Kdmhars, Nais and Sdds. 

GoLERA, a tribe which gives its name to the tract in Rawalpindi so called. 
It is descended from its eponym, the third son of Qutb Shah, and in 
Sialkot has four branches, Golera, Kahambdrah, Dengla and Mandu.

According to Cracroft the Golera are Awdns, a statement confirmed 
by their claim to descend from Qutb Shdh. 

GoLERiA, an offshoot of the great Rajput clan, the Katoch, bearing a terri- 
torial designation from Goler. 

GoLiA or Gawalia, a very curious tribe of Jats, only found in Rohtak 
and Karn^l. They declare that they were originally Brahmans, who 
lost caste by inadvertently drinking liquor placed outside a distiller's 
house in large vessels igol). The local Brahmans apparently admit the 
truth of this story. They now intermarry with Jats, but not with the 
Dagar or Sulanki ; for while they were Brahmans the latter were their 
clients, while when they first lost caste the former alone of all Jdt tribes 
would give them their daughters to wife, and so have been adopted as 
quasi-hrethren. They came from Jndore to Rohtak some 30 generations 
ago. 

GoNDAL, a Jd.t clan (agricultural) found in Shahpur, Multan, and (classed as 
Rajput) in Montgomery. They hold the upland known as the Gondal 
Bar. running up the centre of the tract between the Jhelum and Chenab. 
They are also numerous in tlie riverain on the right bank of the former 
river in the Jhelum district, and a few have spread eastward as far as 
the Ravi. They are said to be Chauhdn Rd-jputs, but they are now of 
Jat status and intermarry with other Jat tribes. 'Physically they are a fine 
race, owing doubtless to the free and active life they lead, and the quan- 
tities of animal food lihey consume ; and if we except their inordinate 
passion for appropriating their neighbours' cattle, which in their estima- 
tion carries with it no moral taint, they must be pronounced free from 
vice.' They say their ancestor came from Naushahra in the south to Pd,k- 
pattan, and was there converted by Baba Farid ; and if this be so they 
probably occupied their present abodes within the last six centuries. 

Gondal, a tribe of Muhammadan Jats in Gujr^t which claims Chauhan 
Rajput origin. Its eponym came from the Deccan to visit the shrine of 
Bd-wd, Farid and Pakpattan and embraced Islam. 

GoPALAK, a Jd,t clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

Gopang, Gophang, one of the broken Baloch tribes of Dera Ghazi Kh^n. 
It lies scattered along the Indus and is also found in Muzaffargarh 
and on the Lower Indus and Sutlej in Bahd.walpur and Multan. 

GoPA Rai, a tribe of J^ts, claiming Solar Rajput origin and descent 
from its eponym through Millu who migrated from Amritsar to Si^lkot. 
Also found in Muzaffai-garh and Montgomery in which Districts they are 
classed as agricultural clans. 

GoE, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

GoEAE, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

GoEAH, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

GoRANGj a Gurkha clan (Nipalese) found in the Simla Hill States.

Oordya — Gosdin. 303 

GoRAYA, a J^t tribe, said to be descended from the Sarolia family of 
Lunar Rajputs, and to have come to Gujrj'mwiila as a nomad and pastoral 
tribe from Sirea. Another story is tliat they are descended from a 
Sombansi Rajput called Gurdya whose grandson Mai came from the 
Lakki ^/laZ some 15 generations ago. A third tradition is that Rjlna 
their founder, came from the Jammu hills in the time of the emperors. 
They are now found in Gujranwiila, Sifilkot and Gurdrlspur. They own 
31 villages in Gujranwdla and are excellent cultivators, being one of 
the most prosperous tribes in the District. Tliey have the same pecu- 
liar marriage customs as the Sdhi Jiits. In Sialkot they revere Pir 
Mundd, round whose khdngdk a bridal pair walks seven times, and offer- 
ings are made to it. This is done both by Hindus and Muhammadans. 
They are said to be governed by the chundavand rule of inheritance. In 
Montgomery the Muhamm.adan Goraya appears as a J^t. Rajput and 
Arain clan (all three agricultural), and in Shahpur it is also classed as 
3&X (agricultural). The word gfom^d is said to be used for the nilgai 
{I orcax picta) in Central India. 'J'hey are sometimes said to be a cfan 
of the Dhillon tribe, but in Sialkot claim descent from Buuh who had 
20 sons, including Gorayd. 

GoRi, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

GoRiA, a small Jat clan found in Nabha. It derives its name from Goran 
Singh, a Rajput, who settled at Alowdl in Patidla and thus became

GosAiN, a term even more vaguely used than 'Sannid,si Balrd,gi ' and 
very difiBcuIt to define in the Punjab. Roughly speaking, it denotes an 
ascetic of any order, but it further connotes that he is of some standino- 
and influence. Strictly speaking, however, the Gosains form a distinct 
order, which differs both from the Bairagis and the Sanniilsis, thouo-h 
they are often entitled Gosdins, and often the Brahmans alone are con- 
sidered privileged to be so styled. In Kilngra the Gosdina form a 
separate caste, as well as an order, and are known as Sanniasis or 
Dasndmis, because they are divided into ten schools. These were 
founded by the ten pupils of Shankar Acliarj and the following scheme 
exhibits their spiritual descent and distribution"^' : — 



* Krom the dasndm of the Gosains : "Bhaktmar'. Nawal Kishor, 1927, p. 77. But 
another account gives Rukhar and DanJi instead of Asram and Sarasw'ati. It also 
states that the Rukhar is like an Acharj (Brahman) in that he receives pifts on the death 
of a Oosain. In the Brahmacharj dsciw, or stage the ' Gosifn ' dons the ja»eo or 
sacred thread of caste, in the second dsram or degree he becomes a Gosiin and puts 
it off again. In the third dsmm he becomes a paramh.-.ns. and in the fourth an Abdhut 
The paramhans shaves his head and the abdhut generall}^ lives naked. This is the 
order observed in the Sanyas Dharm. but now-a-days a Gosain merely besmears himself 
with ashes and goes forth as an abdhut. The true Gosain must not appreach a fire 
and when he dies he is buried, not cremated. *

These correspond with the ten pads of the Sannidsis, and the 
Gos^in may be regarded as a semi-secularised offshoot of the Sanni^si 
order. When the Muhammadan invasions began, says one account 
of the Sannidsis, many of them fled to the hills of Kd-ngra and Simla 
where they formed colonies. In some places they intermarried with 
Brahmans and took to cultivation, gradually amassing such wealth 
that the hill people, including their Rajds and Rd,aas, were in their 
debt and they controlled all the trade between the hills and the plains. 
In their practice of usury they were rapacious to an incredible degree, 
charging 24, 60 and even 72 per cent, a year, and making regular 
tours in state after each harvest, in spring and autumn, to collect their 
dues in kind. Once in debt to the Gosdins there was no escape for 
a debtor, and they preached the doctrine that the removal of a debtor's 
name from their books was an ill-omen to both parties. To the power 
of capital they added the influence of their own sanctity and though 
the Gurkha invasions broke up their domination they continued to 
exhaust the resources of the people in the Outer Sardj tract of KuUu 
till quite recently. On the other hand the Gos^ins of Kdngra, who 
are principally found in N^daun and Jawd,lamukhi, were au enterprising 
and sagacious community engaged in wholesale trade. They mono- 
polised the trade in opium and specuhited in charas, wool and cloth. 
Their transactions extended to the Deccan and indeed over all India, 
but generally speaking, they are now impoverished and their brick- 
built ware-houses at Jaw^lamukhi are mostly in ruins. Most of the 
Kd-no-ra Gosains are of the Giri sub-order, and affix -gir to their names. 

In theory the Gosdins are celibate, and recruit by adopting chelas 
from pure castes who may be willing to dedicate their sons to them, 
but in practice marriage is usual. Those who marry are styled 
gharhari. Natural sons do not succeed unless adopted as chelaa.

returned theraeselves as such, and at the recent Census their number has falle 
further to 107,827. This decrease is accounted for by the large number of un

Gosal — Guda, 305 

Widows are merely entitled to maintenance. Secular Gosdios will not 
pli)ugh, but they do not wear a,nj jaueo, letain tlio choti and yet wear 
a pagri dyed with red ochre. The religious or matdari Gos^ins fo-m 
frritt-rnitieo and, though they do not marry, keep >/omen. Tiiey are 
divided into akhnras or small colleges each under a inahant who liaa 
supreme control of all its property, the disciples beiut; dependent 
on his bounty A mahant dt-signates his successor, and his selecion 
is rarely disputed, but if he die without having named a successor 
the fraternity meets together and with the aid of other Gosdins elt-cta 
a new mahant. After his instnllation the late mahanVs property is 
distributed by him as he thinks fit, and this distribution, or hhanddra 
as it is called, is rarely impugned. Like a Sanniasi the Gos^in is buried, 
a cenotaph or samddh, dedicated to Mahadeo, being raised over him, 
as he is supposed at death to be re-united with the god. Initiation 
consists simply in thn guru's cutting off the choti ; the head is then 
close shaved and the guric mantar read. 

In Sirsa the Gosdina form a separate caste, originating in a 
Bub-division of the Sanni^sis which was founded by Shitnbu Achiirj. 
Every Gosdin is given at initiation a name, which ends in gir, pi'iri 
(the two most commonlv found in this tract), tWath, dsram, dyan o:: 
nath, by his guru. Each of these sub-orders is endoyiamous, i.e., 
a gir may not marry a puri.* The Go-^ains are also said to have qots, 
and to be further divided inio the ghorhdr or secular luid the celibate 
who are either (I) matdari (whose dwelling, mat, is inside the village 
and who may engage in all worldly pursuits, but not marry), (2) 
dsanddri (whone house is on the outskirts of the village), or (3) ahdhut, 
who wander about berrRino:, but may not beg for more than seven hours 
at. one place. The ahdhut carry with them a nurial or cocoanut shell, 
and may only take in almi cooked grain which they must soak in 
water before they eat it. Nor may they halt more than three days at 
any place unless it be a tirath (place of pilgrimage) or during the rains. 
Gosdins are generally clad in garments dyed with geru. 

In the south-west of the Punjab the priests of Sh^mji and L^lji 
who are Khatris atid found largely at Leia and Bhakkar, are called 
Gos^ins. The Khatris and Aror^s of the south-w^st are either 
disciples (sewaks) of these Gosains or Sikhs.f Other Gosiins are 
those of Baddoke, 

The Gosd,ins appear to be correctly classed as a Vaishnava sect or 
rather order, though in the liills they affect Mahadeo and are mahnnts 
of temples of Shiva.

of Gujr^t takes its name from the town of Gujrdt, but the present town 
though a modern one stands on the site of an ancient city called Udanagri, 
the everlasting or fragrant township. Popular tradition assigns its 
founHation to Kd,jd Bachan Pd,l, a iSurajbansi Rdjput who came from the 
Gar getic Do^b, and attributes its restoration to AH Khdn, a Gujar, 
doubthssthe historical Alakhana, Raja of Gurjara, who was defeated 
by Sangkara Varma between 883 and 901 A. D. Captain Mackenzie, 
however, recorded another tradition which assigned the restoration of 
Gujr^ttownto Rani Gujran, wife of Badr Sain, son of R^,ja Risalu 
of Sidlkot who rebuilt it in Sambat 175 (A. D. 118). Both accounts 
aoree in ascribing the refounding of the modern town to the time 
of Akbar. According to Stein, Shankara Varma of Kashmir, soon 
after his accession in 883 A. D., undertook an expedition to the 
south and south-west qf Kashmir and first invaded fiujaradesa, a 
tract certainly identifiable with the modern District of Gujrat, which 
lies between the Chendb and Jhelum.* At an earlier period, in the 
lat^-er part of the 6th century, the Rdjd of Thdnesar, Prabd-kara-vardhana, 
had also carried on a successful campaign against the Hun settlements 
in the north-west Punjab and the ' clans of Gurjara't, so that it would 
/ appear that a branch of the Gurjara race was firmly established in the 
^ modern Gnjrc4t before 600 A. D.j' 

The modern District of Gujrit, however, comprises the Herdt or J^t 
pargana and the Gujrdt or Gujar pargana.^ These parganas used to 
be divided into tappas and the tappas into tops, each top being under 
a chaudhri. 

The modern District of Muzaffargarh also possesses a Gujrat on the 
Indus, in the riverain which runs parallel with the Dera Ghdzi Kh^u 

district. 

The Distribution of the Gojaes. 

The present distribution of the Gujars in India is thus described by 
Sir Alexander Cunningham : — 

" At the present day the Gujars are found in great numbers in every 
part of the North-West of India, from the Indus to the Ganges, and 
from the Hazdra mountains to the Peninsula cf Gujardt. They are 
specially numerous along the banks of the Upper Jumna, near Jagadhri 
and Buriya, and in the Sahdranpur district, which during the last 
century was actually called Gujardt. To the east they occupy the petty

J For the derivation of the word (lujrat see Dr. Fleet's note in J. R. A. S., 1906, p. 459. 
He derives it from Gujaratra, Prakrit Gujjaratta, the modern name of Guzerat being due 
to Alberuni's Guz(a)ia,t. «-iujrinwala means the 'Gujars' village,' Gujrit the 'Gujars' 
country,' a distinction overlooked in Baden-fowell's I'<dian Village Community.

Distribution of the Gujars. ^(jff 

State of Samptar in Bundelkliand, and one of the northern Districts of 
Gvvalior, which is still called Gnjargdr. They are found only in small 
bodies and much scattored throughout Eastern Riijputiina and Glwalior; 
but they are more numerous itj the VVestprn States, and specially 
towards Gujardt, where they form a largo part of the population. The 
Ildjd,8 of Rewdri to the south of Delhi are (iujars. In the Southern 
Punjab they are thinly scnttored, bat their numbers increase rapidly 
towards the north, where they have giv^n their name to several 
important places, such as Guj I dnwala in the Rechna Doab, Giijrat in 
the Chaj Dod,b, and Gujar Khsin in the Sindh Sagar Doab. They are 
numerous about Jhelura and Hassan Abdal,"^' and throughout the Haz^ra 
district; and they are also found in considerable numbers in the Dardu 
districts of Chilas, Kohli, and Palas, t») the east of the Indus, and in 
the contiguous districts to the v/est of the river." 

In the Puniab they essentially belong to tlie lower ranges and sub- 
montane tracts ; and though they have spread down the Jumna in 
considerable numbers, they are almost confined to the riverain low- 
lands. In the higher mountains they are almost unknown. Gujrat is 
still their stronghold, and in that District they form 13^ per cent, of 
the total population. There alone have they retained their dominant 
position. Throughout the Salt Range, and probably under the eastern 
hills also, they are the oldest inhabitants among the tribes now settled 
there; but in the west the (^akkliars, Janjuns, and Pa^h^ns, and in the 
east the Rajputs have alwavs been too strong for tliem, and h'ng ago 
deprived them of political importance. In the Peshawar district 
almost any herdsman is called a Gujar, and it may be that some of 
those who are thus returned are not true Gujars by race. But 
throughout the hill country of Jammu, Chibh^l, and Hazd,ra, and away 
in the territory lying to the north of Peshdvvar as far as the Swdt 
river, true Gujar herdsmen are found in great numbers, all possessing 
a common speech, which is a Hindi dialect quite distinct from the 
Panjabi or Pashto current in those parts. Here they are a purely 
pastoral and almost nomad race, taking their herds up into the higher 
ranges in summer and descending with them into the valleys during 
the cold weather ; and it may be said that the Gujar is a cultivator 
only in the plains. Even there ho is a bad cultivator, and more given 
to keeping cattle than to following the plough. In Chitrdl also Gujars 
are found in the Shishi Kuh valley, vvliile the Bashgals (the Kafirs of 
the Bashgal valley are so styled by Chitrdlis) are described as curiously 
like the Gujars in the Punjab.f 

It is impossible without further investigation to fix the date of the 
Gujar colonization of the lower disti-icts. They are almost exclusively 
Musalman except in the Jumna Districts and Hoshiarpur, and they 
must therefore have entered those Districts before the conversion of the 
great mass of the caste. The Jullundur Gujars date their conversion 
from the time of Aurangzeb, a very probable date. The Ferozepur 
Gujars say that they came from D^ranagar in the south of India, that 
they moved thence to Raiiia in Sirsa, and thence again to Ferozepur 
via, Kasur. The Musalman Gujars of all the eastern half of the Pro-

308 Gujar characteristics. 

vince still retain more of their Hindu customs than do the majority of 
their converted neighbours, their women, for instance, wearing petti- 
coats instead of drawers, (just a*^ they do in JuUundur also), and red 
instead of blue. In Jullundur the Gujar shoe is usually of a peculiar 
make, the upper leather covering little of the foot. It is noticeable that 
Gujr^t, is to the Gujars what Bhatner and Bhattid,na are to the Bhatti, 
a place to which there is a traditional tendency to refer their origin. 

The Gujar is a fine stalwart fellow, of precisely the same physical 
type as the J4t ;* and the theory of aboriginal descent which has some- 
times been propounded, is to my mind conclusively negatived by his 
cast of countenance. He is of the same social standing as the Jdt, or 
perhaps slightly inferior ; but the two eat and drink in common without 
any scruple, and the proverb says : "The J at, Gujar, Ah ir, and Gola 
are all four hail fellows well met." But he is far inferior in both 
personal character and repute to the Jd,t. He is lazy to a degree, and 
a wretched cultivator; his women, though not secluded, will not do 
field work save of the lightest kind ; while his fondness for cattle 
extends to those of other people. The difference between a Gujar and 
a Rajput cattle-thief was once explained to me thus by a Jdt: "The 
Rajput will steal your buffalo. But he will not send his father to 
say he knows where it is and will get it back for Rs. 20, and then 
keep the Rs. 20 and the buffalo too. The Gujar will." The Gujars 
have been turbulent throughout the history of the Punjab, they were 
a constant thorn in the side of the Delhi emperors, and are still ever 
ready to take advantage of any loosening: of the bonds of discipline to 
attack and plunder their neighbours. Their character as expressed in 
the proverbial wisdom of the countryside is not a high one : " A 
desert is better than a Gujar : wherever you see a Gujar, hit him." 
Again : " The dog and the cat two, the Hangar and the Gujar two ; 
i! it were not for thes^ four, one might sleep with one's door open" : 
so " The doyr, tlie monkey, and the Gujar change their minds at every 
step;" and ''When all other cfistes are dead make friends with a 
Gujnr." As Mr. Macunachie remarks: "Though the Gujar possesses 
two qualifications of a highlander, a hilly home atid a constant desire 
for other people's cattle, he never seems to have had the love of 
fighting and the character for manly independence which distinguishes 
this class elsewhere. On the contrary he is generally a mean, sneak- 
ing, cowardly fellow; and I do not know that he improves much with 
the march of civilization, though of course there are exceptions ; men 
Avho have given up the traditions of the tribe so far as to recognize 
the advantage of being honest — generally." 

Such is the Gujar of the Jumna Districts. t But further west his 
character would seem to be higher. Major Wace describes the Gujars 

* This description would appear to require some qualification. The Gujar of Kashmir 
is described as tall and gaunt, his forehead and his chin are narrow, his nose fine and 
Blightly curve.!. The Gujar of the United Provinces is above the medium height, Well made 
ani active, his face long and oval, and his features fine rather than coars«. Ccooke 
describe.s him as ' a fairly typical Indo- Aryan.' J. R. A. S., 1907, p. 984. The Puijab 
Gujar might be well described in the above terms. As compared with the Jit he has 
better features, but is not of sUch a good type. 

I Sir J Wilson however, wrote : " 'I'he iiujar villages in Gurgaon have on the whole stood 
the late bad times better than those of almost other caste — better than the Jats, and almost 
as well as the Ahirs. Our Gurgaon Gujars are very little given to thieving, and I have 
wther a high opinion of them," 



The Gujars in Kdngra. 309 

of Hazaraas " a simple all-enduring race, thrifty and industrious, with 
no ambition but to be left alone in peace with their cattle and fields "; 
and " many of them are fine men in every way." Mr. Thomson says 
that the Gnjarg of Jhelum are the best farmers in the District (perhaps 
not excessive praise in a District held by Gakkhars, Awuns, and 
H^jputs), though the Maliiir or Ardin is a better market gardener; 
and that they are quiet and industrious, more likeable than (Salt Range) 
Ja^s, but with few attractive qualities. Mr. Steedman gives a similar 
account of the Gujar-s of Rawalpindi, calling them "excellent culti- 
vators." So the Gujars of Hoshiarpur are said to be " a quiet and 
well-behaved set." In Jullundur Sir Richard Temple described them 
as " here as elsewhere of pastoral habits, but more industrious and less 
predatory than usual" ; and Mr, Barkley writes: "At present, after 
30 years of British rule, they are probably as little given to crime as 
any other large class in the agricultural population. It is still 
generally true that they occupy themselves mor<^ with grazing than 
with agriculture ; but this is by no means invariably the case." But 
in Ferozepur again Mr. Brandreth describes them as " unwilling 
cultivator.H, and greatly addicted to thieving," and gives instances of 
their criminal propensities. Thus it would appear that the further the 
Gujar moves from his native hills, the more he deteriorates and tho 
more unpleasant he makes himself to his neighbours. The following 
description cf the Gujars of Kangra by Mr. Barnes is both graphic and 
interesting : — 

*• The Gujars of the hills are quite unlike the caste of the same desig- 
nation in the plains. There they are known as an idle, worthless and 
thieving race, rejoicing in waste, and enemies to cultivation and im- 
provement ; but above and below they are both addicted to pastoral 
habits. In the hills the Gujars are exclusively a pastoral tribe, — they 
cultivate scarcely at all. The Gaddis keep flocks of sheep and goats, 
and the Gujar's wealth consists of buffaloes. These people live in the 
skirts of the forest>', and maintain their existence exclusively by the 
sale of the milk, glii, and other produce of their herds. The men 
graze the cattle, and frequently lie out for weeks in the woods tending 
their herds. The women repair to the markets every morning with 
baskets on their heads, with little earthen pots filled with milk, butter- 
milk and gliif each of these pots containing the proportion required 
for a day's meal. During the hot weather the Gujars usually drive 
their herds to the upper range, where the buffaloes rejoice in the rich 
gra'^s which the rains bring forth, and at the same time attain condition 
from the temperate climate and the immunity from venomous flies 
which torment their existence in the plains. The Gujars are a fine, 
manly race, with peculiar and handsome features. They are mild and 
inoffensive in manner, and in these hills are not distinguished by the 
bad pre-eminence which attaches to their race in the plains. They are 
never known to thisve. Their women are supposed to be not very 
scrupulous. Their habits of frequenting public markets and carrying 
about their stock for sale unaccompanied by their husbands undoubtedly 
expose them to great temptations ; and I am afraid the imputations 
against their character are too vVell founded. They are tall, well-grown 
Avomen, and may b^ seen every morning entering the bazars of the hill 
towns, returning home about the afternoon with their baskets emptied 



310 Giijar origins. 

of their treasures. The Gujars are found all over the District. They 
abound particularly about JwdMrnuklii, Tira, and Nadaun. There 
are som^ Hindu Gujars, especially towards Mandi ; but they are a small 
sect compared to the Musalmans." 

** It has been suggfested," continued Sir Donzil Ihbetson, " and ia I 
believe held by many, that Jdts and Gujars, and perhaps Ahirs also, are 
all of one ethnic stock; and this becausn there is a close communion 
between them. It may be that they are the same in their far-distant 
ori^'in. But I think that they must have either entered India at differ- 
ent times or settled in separate parts, and my reason for thinking so is 
precisely because they eat and smoke together. In the case of Ja^ and 
Rd,jput the reason for differentiation is obvious, the latter being of 
higher rank than the former. But the social standing of J^ts, Gujars, 
and Ahirs being practically identical, I do not see why they should 
- ever have separated if they were once the same. It is however 
possible that, the J^ts were the camel graziersi and perhaps husband- 
men, the Gujars the cowherds of the hills, and the Ahirs the cowherds 
of the plains. If this be so, they afford a classi6cation by occupation 
of the yeoman class, which fills up the gap between and is absolutely 
continuous with the similar classification of the castes above them as 
Brahmans, Banias, and Rd^jputs, and of the castes below them as Tarkhdns, 
Cham^rs, and so forth. But we must know more of the early distribu- 
tion of the tribes before we can have any opinion on the subject. I have 
noticed in the early historians a connection between the migrations and 
location of Gujars and Rdjputs which has struck me as being more than 
accidental ; but the subject needs an immense deal of work upon it 
before it can ba said to be even ready for drawing conclusions.* 

The oeigin of the Gujaes. 

A full history of the ancient Gurjaras and of the great Gurjara 
empire, the existence of which the late Mr. A. M. T. Jackson claimed to 
have established,t would be beyond the scope of this article, but the 
reader's attention may be directed to certain incidents in their history 
in the Punjab. According to Dr. Rudolf Hoernle the Tomaras (the 
modern Tunwar Rajputs) were a clan of the Gurjaras, and indeed their 
imperial or ruling clan. The Pehowa (Pehoa in the Karnal district) 
inscription records of a Tomara family that it was descended from a 
raja, Jaula, whose name recalls that of the Sh^hi Javuvla or Jahula 
and of the mahdrdj'a, Toram^na Shahi Jaiivla of the Kura inscription. 
Dr. Hoernle thinks it probable that the Kachwahas and Parihars, like 
the Tomaras, were all clans or divisions of a Javula tribe, claiming 
descent from Toramana, king of the White Huns or Ephthalites.J 
Mr. Bhandarkar has shown that the Solankis (Chaulakyas), Parihars 

* Mr. Wilson notes that the Gujars and the Bargujar tribe of Rajputs are often found 
together; and suggests that the latter may be to the Gujars what the Khanzadahs are to 
the Meos and what most Rajputs are to the Jats. 

t See his note in J. R. A. S. 1905, pp. 163-4, where he identifies the Gurjaras with the 
Gaudaa ((^aur*-', now Brahmans) and points out that according to Alberiini (Sachau's 
Trans. i.,P- 3i'0) Gucla = Taneshar. The Gaur Brahmans were and indeed are parohits of 
the Hindu Gujars and still minister to some who are converts to Islam.

Eajputs are probably of Gujar descent. 



Krishna and the Gujara. 31 1 

(Pratihdras), Parmars (Paramiiras) and Chauhiins (ChJlhnmJlnas or 
CMhuvrmas), the four so-called A^nikula clans of Hiijputs, were originally 
divisions of the Gurjaras, and to these Dr. Iloernlo would thus add the 
Tomaras and Kachhvvfihas. TJio exact ethnic relation of the Gurjaraa 
to the Huns is still very obscure, but as a working hypothesis Dr. 
Hoernle thinks that in the earlier part of the 6th century A. D. a great 
invasion of Central Asiatic peoples, Huns, Gurjaras and others, whose 
exact interrelation we do not know, took place. The first onset carried 
them as far as Gwalior, but it was checked by the emperor of Kat)auj, and 
the main portion of these foreign hordes settled in Riljputrtna and the 
Punjab, while the Chaulakyas turned south. In tlie north the invaders 
fused with the natives of the country and in the middle of the 7th 
century the Farihars emerged, an upgrowth followed by that the 
Parmars, Chauhiins and imperial Gurjaras about 750 A. D. About 840 
the Giirjara empire, with its capital at Kanauj, embraced nearly the 
whole of northern India, under Bhoja I, bat after his death it declined.* 

Another problem of great interest in the history of Indian religions 
is the connection of tlie GiJrjaras with the cult of the child Krishna of 
MathurA, as contrasted with that of the ancient Krishna of Dwdrak^.f 
This cult was, almost beyond questiou, introduced into India by 
nomads from the north, very probably by the Gurjaras. No doubt the 
modern Guj^rs, even those who have retained their Hindu creeds, have 
lost all recollection of any special devotion to the cult of Krishna, and 
he is now prominent in the traditions of the Ahirs, but certain groups 
of the Ahirs appear to be of Gurjara origin. Among them we find the 
Nandbansi whose name reminds us of Nand Mihr, a legendary progeni- 
tor of the Gujars, and a Solanki (Chaulakya) got appears among tho 
Jadubansi. If we may assume that these two great races, the Gujar 
and Ahir, once pastoral, and still largely so, are really identical, the 
theory that tho cult of the child Krishna was introduced into India by 
the Gujars in general or more particularly by the Nandbansi and 
Gud^lbansi branches of the Ahirs becomes greatly strengthened. Like 
the Huns, the Gurjaras were originally sun-worshippers, but they have 
lost all traces of any special devotion to the cult of the Sun-god, and 
may have acquired some tincture of Christianity either from their 
neighbours in Central Asia or from their connection with Christians 
among the Huns. J 

Various origins are claimed by different Gujar clans. Thus in 
Gujrdt the Chauhdn claim descent from Rai Pithora of Delhi. 

TheChhokar in Karnal say they are Chandarbansi and an offshoot of 
the Jadu Riijputs of Muzaffarnagar in the United Provinces. The 
Bhodwtil, Kalsian and Rawul all claim to be Chandarbansi, the 
Kalsian being Chauhdns and the Hawjlls Khokhar R.'ijputs by origin ; 
but the Chham^n say they are Surajbansi and Tunwd,rs. 

In Gurdaspur the Bhaddna, Chhdla, Kasdna, Munin§ and Tur gots 
claim Rajput descent and the Banths and Biijars Jdt extraction, while

ed off. 



312 The Oujar sections. 

the Cliapras say they are Khatris by origin, and the Modis, Pathdna. 
The Chh^la got claims descent from Rdjd. Som Bans, Raid, of Gahr 
Gajni in the Deccan, and its ancestor embraced Islam at R^hon in 
Jullundur, mnrried a Gaug Kasiina girl and so becamo a Gujar. The 
Kasdna declares itself descended from Kdja Kans, the Munin from R^j^ 
Indar Rai, and the Panddoa from R^ljd Panda R^i. 

The Pasw^l ascribe their foundation to Wajih Kalbi, a companion of 
the Prophet, who accompanied Ahutas, ruler of Yemen, when he 
conquered Kashmir. The Pasw^l originally settled in Sidlkot but have 
spread into Gurddspur. 

The Hindu Rd,wat Mandan got is found in the Bd;wal nizdmat of 
Nd^bha. It traces its descent to one R^wat who fell in love with a 
damsel, Gorsi, whom he only carried off after a great struggle. His 
mesalliancp. cost him his status as a Rajput and he became a Gujar. 
The got derives its name from him and fi'om the number of heads 
.(^andaji) which fell in the struggle for Gorsi. This gut is numerous 
in Jaipur, where it keeps its women in parda and forbids widow 
remarriage, bub this is allowed in Nd-bha. Formerly the Rd,wat 
Mandan did not roof their houses or put planks to their doorways, 
though they now do so. A child's first tonsure should be performed at 
the shrine of Swd-mi Pun Dd,s in Rewdri tabsil. 

The Chokar of Ndbha, who appear to be distinct from the Chhokar, 
are Hindus and trace their descent from Sankat, a Chauhd,n Rdjput of 
S^mbhar in Jaipur, who was a great robber. Once on the road he 
forcibly espoused a beautiful girl whose kinsmen came to her aid, but 
Sankat sought help from Ban Deo and he and his comrades took the 
shapes of birds, and escaped. A barber too ransr a wedding-bell in 
front of their pursuers, and they resolved to turn back. So the got of 
Sankat was called Chokar, ' one who misses,' and it still affects Ban 
Deo, holding the first tonsure of its children at his shrine in Jaipur, 
never burning cotton sticks for fuel and only using cotton after first 
offering it to Ban Deo. 

In Ndbha the Bhargar, Ohaprd,na, Doi, Kasdna, Khard,na and 
Sardhd^na Gujars all vaguely claim Rd,jput origin, but unlike other 
Hindu Gujars they only avoid three gots in marriage, permitting it in 
the mother's father's got. They specially affect Devi and do not give 
the beestings of a cow or buffalo to any one till the Amd^was, when they 
cook rice in the milk, place it on a spot plastered with cow-dung and 
then give it to their children. The Bhargar, like the Rawat Mandan, 
use no doors or roofs of timber, and ascribe this tabu to the fact that 
one of their women became a sati and a house raised in her honour 
was left incomplete.'^ 

The Melu Gujars in Ndbha are converts from Hinduism, but still 
avoid four gots in marriage. They do not build two hearths close 
together, or wear blue cloth. Their women wear gowns. This got 
never sell milk, lest the animal fall ill, but they may sell ghi. 

The elements of the Gujars are not easy to describe. Local tradi- 
tions, as has already been shown, vary as to the origins of many clans, 

* Or unroofed ? Apparently a hypsethral shrine ii meant. 



The Giijar element!^. 313 

but the following addenda may be noted as to the clans descended 
from the various Rdjput races ; — Chaulian origin is claimed by the 
Bhalesar, * sons of Bhallu,' Babarwal, Jhandar, Kalsid-n (iu Karndl). 

Panwd,r descent is claimed by the Bahlo^, Chhdii, Phambhrd, 'sons of 
Phamar^ and Paur* : Jddu (Chandarbansij descent by the Chhokar (in 
Karn^l), Janjua origin by the Barrdh, Khokhar (Chandarbansi) by the 
Kawd,l (in Karndl), Manhas by the Dhinda, Sombansi by the Dhakkar, 
Surajbansi by the Saramdna, and Tur by the Chhamdn (in Karn^l). 

Folk-etymology and legendary lore have been busily engaged in 
finding explanations of various clan names among the Gujars. Thus of 
the Barras, (a Avord meaning 'holy') it is said that their ancestor 
FatihuHa used to bring water from tho river at Multiin barefoot, for his 
spiritual guide's ablutions. One day the Pir saw that his disciple's foot 
had been pierced with thorns, so he gave him his shoes, but Fatihulla 
made them into a cap, as worthy to be so worn, and again his feet were 
pierced with thorns. The Pir seeing this blessed him and called him 
Barra.t 

The Bharyar claim descent from Rajd, Karn. The children of his 
descendant Rdja Dhal always used to die and his physicians advised 
him to feed his next child on the milk of a she- wolf (bhairya), whence 
the name Bharydr. Buta embraced Islam in Babar'e time and settled 
in Shdhpur. 

Of the Gajgahi section it is said that Wali, their ancestor, was a 
Khatana who wore a gajgah or horse's silver ornament, so his descendants 
are now called Gajgahi. 

Of the Khatanas' origin one story is that one day Mor and Mohang, 
sons of R^ja Bhans, came back from hunting and ate on a hhdt or bed. 
For this breach of social etiquette theBrahmans outcaeted them, saying 
they had become MuhfimmadanS; so they adopted Islam and were 
nicknamed Khatana. Another legend makes the Khatanas descendants 
of R^jA Jaspjil and the Pandavas- Jasp^l had extended his dominions 
from ThdnesMr to Jhelum and, when Sultan Mnhmud Sabukta^fn 
invaded Hindustan, Jaspill met him at Attock, but was defeated and 
slain. His son, Anandpal, ruled for two years at Lahore and then fled 
to Hindustan, leaving two sons, Khatana and Jaideo or Jagdeo, ot whom 
the former ruled at Lahore and turned Muhammadan. Oiher Gujar 
clans also claim descent from Anandpil, and 'Sultiin Mahmud assigned 
the Khatanas jagirs in Gujrat where they founded Shahpur, now a 
deserted mound near Chak Dina. 

The Khatanas are not only a leading Gujar clan but have many off- 
shoots in the minor sections, such as the Gajgahis, Topas, Amriinas, 
Awanas, Bhundp, Bukkans, Thilas, and the Jatigal, Debar, Doi, and 
Lohsar clans. 

Hindu Khatanas are also found in the Bdwal nizdviat of N^bha and 
there claim Tur Rajput origin, deriving their name from Khatu Nagar, 
a village in Jaipur. As followers of Bilwa Mohan Das Bhadaw^iswilla

they^ abstain from flesh and wine. At weddings the Jdt ceremonies 
are bbserv^d and on tlip departure of the bridegroom's party his father 
is beaten by the women of tlie bride's family. 

The Topas are really Khatdnas and when the J&^s and Gujars were 
competing for the honour of giving the biggest contribution to Akbar's 
rebuilding of Gujr^t town one Adam, a Khatana, paid a lahh and a 
quarter of rupees into the imperial treasury, measuring the money in a 
topa, whence his descendants are so named. 

In Hazd,ra the Terus say they are really Rajputs and descended 
from a raja who was so generous that when once a faqir to test him 
demanded his head he stooped so that the faqir might cut it off, 
which he did. Having thus proved his generosity the faqir replaced 
his head on his shoulders and prayed for his life to be restored to him. 
The clan name is derived from trer, a scar. 

In Delhi certain Gujar clans claim descent from eponyms. Such are 
Budhana, descendants of Bhopal; Amlaota, from Ambapd^l, Bhotla, from 
Bharup ; Baliiln, from Baniapal ; Dhaidha, from Diptipdl; Chinori, from 
Chhainpal; Nangri, from Naghpal, and Tanur, from Tonpal. As to the 
Adhana, tradition says that Riija Ed.m Chand of the solar race had two 
sons, Lu and Kush. The latter was the progenitor of the Kachhwdi 
Rajputs ; while Lu's son Ganwat had a son named Rajd, who made a karao 
marriage and was nicknamed Gujar. He had two sons Adhe and Swahi. 
The latter died sonless, but Adhe founded the Adhana clan. 

Organization.^-li is generally asserted that the real (asli) or original 
Gujars are the 2^ sections, Gorsi, Kasdna and the half tribe Burgat, 
so-called as descended from a slave mother.* Next to these rank 
the Khatanas who for a long period held sway in the Gujrat, in which 
tract, hovvpver, the 2^ section-* were the oriyinal settlers, the other 
sections having iiecotne affiliated to them in course of time, though 
not necessarily Gujars by origin. As an instance of this process of 
accreti' n the Gujars point to the Barras, of Hasilanwd^ld, village in 
Gujrat, whose forebear Fati-ulla, a Janjua by birth, was deputed by 
one of the saints of MuMn to colonise that tract. All Gujars give 
daughters to the Barras, but never receive them in return, and the 
Barras all rank as Midnas, except those of certain families which have 
forfeited their sanctity, and are designated Pir.t 

In Hazara the 2^ ' real' sections do not appear to be recognised, but 
it is generally conceded that the Katharia, Hakla and Sarju sections 
are of Rajput origin, though this origin is also claimed by several 
others. Tradition avers that the Kathdrias once ruled a large part of 

*In Delhi the asli sections are said to be 3| •• — Chechi, Nikadi, Gorsi, and Kasana 
(the half). And in Karnil the 2| sections are said to bo the Gorsi, Chechi and 
KaSana (the half). But the Chechi are said, in Gujrat, to be by origin Khatanas, so 
that the accounts generally agree in representing the Gorsi, Kasana and Khatana as the 
3 original Gujar clans. Several stories are told to explain their pre-eminence. 
Thus in Ludhiana it is said that Jagpal, <!or&i, and Abnya, Khatana, successfully 
resisted Raja Jag's father, D da Dip, in a mock campaign for 3 years, while Nanda 
Lai, Bargatj gave in after a few months — hence his cl»n was called the half. 

t In the Jhelum Gazetteer the Bharras (sic) are said to be descendants of Shaikh 
Natha, of the Manikhiala family, who fled from his home after killing a kinsman, and 
died ia the odour of sanctity. 



Oujar clubs. 315 

the Punch valley, whence the Dogras expelled them, though their chiefs 
still hold large jdgirs in that fief of Kashmir. Naturally the Kathfirias 
only take wives from Gujars of Kdjput descent and only give brides 
to men of their own section.^' 

Tlie Gujars are often said to have 84 clans or sections and in 
Ludhi^na tlieir Mird-sis address them as ' Chaiinisi got da diua/ i. e., 
'Light of the 84 clans' ; but other accounts assign them 101, 170 or 
even 388 sections. 

Of these numerous clans none have any definite superiority over the 
rest, though a few have a vague local standing abf>ve their neighbours. 
Such are the Khobar, Rawdl, Wape and Dhaldkt in Karnill — because 
they abstain from flesh and liquor, whereas the Chhokar, Kalsdn, 
Datyar, Dhosi and Rd^thi sections do not. Of regular classes there is 
hardly a trace, excepting the Mitlnas who form in Gujrat a semi-sacred 
class. They are descendants of men who have acquired a name for 
learning or sanctity and so their descendants cannot give wives to 
Gujars of less exalted rank.J Indeed the leading Khatana family of 
Dincra used to consider it dcrogntory to give daughters to any Gujar 
at all and souyrht bridegroom? in more exalted families, or failintJ^ ihera 
let their girls remain unwed. In Gnjrd,r, the Gujars also po-^sess a 
curious soL-ial oryanisatiou, being possess d of 84 darrs or lodges. § 
Originally the number was only 54 — distiibuttd over the 7 tappas into 
which the tract was divided in Akbar's time, but 20 have been added 
from various families, and 5 assigned to the Gujars of Kdla m Jhelum. 
To become a darr-udld or member requires money, influence and popu- 
larity. A candidate must first, at his son's wedding, obtain the consent 
of the existing darr-wdlds, which is not easily done, as there must be no 
' black-balls,' and he must be on good terms with the leading men. 
Having been thus elected he must pay so much per darrto the mirdsis. 
At present the rate is Rs. 11 per darr so he has to pay 84 x ll = Rs. 924, 
or nearly 60 guineas as entrance fee. His descendants remain darr- 
wdlds, but his agnates do not acquire the privilege. At a son's wed- 
ding in the family a darr-wdld has to pay a fee of not less than 4 annas 
to each darr for its mirdsi. The darr-wdlds do not as a rule give 
daughters in mamage to those who do not possess equal social stand- 
ing. The real origin of this system does not appear to be known, but it 
has some resemblances to the Rajput chhat and makdn, and perhaps 
more to the lodges of the Bani Sadiit. 

The social observances of the Gujars are ordinarily those of the other 
Hindus or Muhammadans, as the case may be, among whom they live, 
bat one or two special customs are to be noted. 

In Delhi a child is betrothed in infancy by the barber and Brahman 
jointly, but he is not married till the age of 10 or 12. Prior to the 
wedding one or the otlier on the bride's part go to the boy's house with 
the lagan to discuss the arrangements for the wedding. Half the lik

or duos are paid to both these functionaries at betrothal and the other 
half at the lagan, whereas Jd,ts pay the whole at betrothal. 

A day or two before the wedding madha worsliip is held, the beam 
of a plough being pitched before the house door with a little straw tied 
to its top. A large earthen jar with a smaller one full of water on top 
of it is also placed beside the beam, a red thread {Tcaldum) being 
fastened round the uppermost pot. Clearly this is a fertility charm, 
and the usage does not imply that the Gujars are devoted to agricul- 
ture. 

In Hoshiil-rpnr the Gujars have a curious custom at weddings. 
Mowey, csb[\ed muddaji mpaiy a or ' viudda at one rupee per soul,' is 
given by well-to-do Gujats on such an occasion to every Mirasi present, 
regardless of age or sex, and a pregnant Mirasian gets two rupees, one 
for each life. When a Gujar at a son's wedding gives this money to the 
Mirdsis of certain speciBed Gujar gots it is called hhdji, and on the 
wedding of any boy of those specified gots the Mirdsi of the Gujar who 
gave the original bhdji is entitled to a rupee. A Gujar who gives 
muddaji rufuiya is held in high esteem socitilly and the Mird^sis style 
him gharhhdn kd data or 'one who is generous even to the child in the 
womb.' 

The Gujars of Nakodar tahsil in JuUundur have the following custom 
(called pindwalna) at marriages, a survival of marriage by capture. 
The young men of the bridegroom's party gallop round the village, 
so as to encircle it ; those of the bride's party endeavour to prevent 
this. If any one of the former succeeds in completing the circle, he is 
given a present by the bride's parents. Another custom is, for the 
girls of the bride or bridegroom's family to try and prevent one of 
their brothers-in-law from lighting the fire on which food for the 
marriage feast is to be cooked. If he succeeds, he is rewarded by a 
present of some article of dress. Hiis custom is c&Wed jhalka-bhathi.* 

In Gurddspur the Muhammadan Gujars date their conversion from 
Hinduism to the time of Aurungzeb. They still observe Hindu rites, 
and on the birth of a son the women make an idol of cow-dung 
{govardhan), which is worshipped. The birth of a son is an expensive 
event, as besides the Qdzi and Mird,si who are fee'd, the child's sister 
and paternal aunt get clothes and a she-luffalo or money, and the Gaur 
Brahman still visits some families as a parohit to bless the child's father 
by placing dab grass on his head. At a wedding too he observes this 
rite, but the chauka is made by a Mirasi. Herein the boy is seated on a 
basket befoie he dons his wedding garments and sets out for the bride's 
house. No Gujar is allowed to marry in his own got, but the Bhatia 
have given up this restriction, and generally Hindu customs are dying 
out among the Muhammadan sections. 

In Gujrdt the customs of the Muhammadan Gujars are in general 
similar to those of the Muhammadan J6ts, but after a birth on the 
dkawan day, when the- mother bathes and leaves the place of her 
confinement, a Brahman comes and makes a square [chauka), on which 
a diwd made of atd (fiour) is lighted. Big rotis too are cooked, each a 
toya in weight, and given to the menials. The Brahman also gets a

topa of cUd. In respectable families hahvd is cooked as well, but it is 
eaten only by persons of the same " bone," i. e., of the same got. 
Married daughters cannot eat this halwd because they have left the 
got, or section. If a son's wife ia away at "her parents' house her share 
is sent her, but none of her parents' family can eat it. 

Milni is not observed at a marriage by the Gu jrdt Gujara, but they 
obMerve the dawa, or ' imitation ' instead. Before the wedding pro- 
cession leaves the bridegroom's house, the Mirdsi of the bride's family 
goes to see what the numbers of the procession will be and so on. Ho 
gets a present and returns, after which the wedding procession starts 
for the bride's house. The Gujars also have a darr or cusloin of pay- 
ment to the Mirdsis of particular families, but it is done only by those 
families, not by all Gujars, whereas the Jdts have their rathachdri 
which may be done by any one who chooses. The darr has already 
been described. Some three or four weeks before the wedding the gala 
ceremony is also observed. Gala means a handful of grain which is 
put into the chaki (mill). The gala marks the commencement of the 
wedding and is celebrated, after the women of the birddri have 
assembled, by grinding 6ve paropis of grain and putting the ntd into 
a pitcher round which mauli thread has been tied. Amongst Hindus 
this mauli is first tied not onl}' to the pitcher but to the chahi, pestle 
and mortar, chhaj, etc., as well, and then the dtd and other articles 
required for the wedding are got together. 

As a caste the Hindu Gujars appear to have no special cults, though 
in Gurgaon they fervently celebrate the Gordhan festival, but it is a 
Hindu, not a special Gujar, fete. In Hissdr Bhairon or Khetrpdl, as a 
village deity, is their chief object of worship. The tradition is that 
he was born ol a virgin. His chief shrine is at Ahror (near Hewdri in 
Gurgaon) where many of the Hissd,r Gujars attend a oreat festival 
held in his honour in February. 

The Muhammadan Gujars of Hazdra have a curious legend which 
recalls those of Dris, the Prophet, and of Hazrat Ghaus of the Chihltan 
mountain near Quetta."^ Their ancestor Nand Mihr, they relate, used 
to serve the Prophet and once gave him a draught of water while at 
prayer. The Prophet promised to fulfil his every wish and Nand Alihr 
asked that his wife might bear him children, so the Prophet gave him 
a charm [tawiz) for her to eat, but she did not eat it. This occurred 
thirty-nine times, and when the Prophet gave Nand the fortieth charm 
he made his wife eat them all at once. In due course she bore him 
forty children, but finding that he could not support them all Nand Mihr 
turned thirty-nine of them adrift. They prospered and built a house 
into which they would not admit their unnatural father, so he on the 
Prophet's advice, surrendered to them his remaining son also. 
Descendants of these forty sons are said to be found in other parts of 
the Punjab and Kashmir but not in Hazdra itself, save as immigrants. 

By occupation the Gujars are essentially a pastoral race, so much so 
that in the Gojra (? Gujrst) something like a regular .stdpa is observed 
on the death of a buffalo, the women mourning for it almost as if for a

human being. A. similar custom is noted in Attock, in which District 
the women may often be seen with veiled faces weeping over the death 
o!:' a milch buffalo. 

In Hoshiarpur Gujar women are in great request as ^yet-nu^ses and 
dwellers in towns frequently put out children to nurse with them for a 
year or more in order that they may grow up strong. Some Gujars 
will not allow their women to go into the towns with milk, and regard 
themselves as superior to those who allow this practice, refusing them 
their daus;hters in marriage. The freedom of Gujar women in this 
- respect has given rise to a general idea that they are immoral. 

In dress the Gujars are not distinguished by any marked peculiari- 
ties. In Gurgaonit is said that the Gujri dresses Kke a Kanjri, which 
reminds one of the proverb : 

Zamin ha yah sal hanjar shawad, 

Gujar he yah nuhta Kanjar shawad, 

" In one year land becomes waste, 

By one dot ' Gujar ' becomes ' Kanjar' "* 

and probably is just as near the truth. In Kanidl the women weave 
chausi, both fine {dkotar) and coarse (gnrhd), of cotton, and it is usually 
dyed blue or red, an^l then printed. In N4bha they are said not to 
wear gold ornaments. 

The Gujars in Bahd,walpur have a hereditary represt^ntative (paghand) 
who presides at weddings and funerals, but he exercises no powers and 
receives no fees. 

The dialect of the Gajars is Gujari or Gojari. It has strong 
aflSnities with the language of Jaipur and is akin to R^jasthani. Gujari 
is spoken by the Himalayan Gujars, including those of the Siwd,lik in 
Hoshiarpur, but elsewhere the Gujars generally speak the dialects of 
ihe people amongst whom they dwell, f 
Gqjarati, or Bids, are described by Sir Denzil Ibbetson as '' Brahmans who 
came from Gu]ard.t in Sindh, are in some respects the highest class of 
all Brahmans ; they are always fed first ; and they bless a Gaur when 
they meet him, while they will not eat ordinary bread from his hands. 
They are fed on the 12th day after death, and the Gaurs will not eat 
on the 13th day if this has not been done. But they take inauspicious 
offerings. To them appertain especially the Rihu offerings made at 
an eclipse. They will not take oil, sesame, goats, or green or dirty 
clothes; but will take old clothes if washed, buffaloes, and satndja. 
They also take a special offering to Rahu made by a sick person, who 
puts gold in qhi, looks at his face in it, and gives it to a Gujardti, or 
who weighs himself against satndja and makes an offering of the grain, 
A buffalo which has been possessed by a devil to that degree that he 
has got on to the top of a house (no difficult feat in a village), or a 
foal dropped in the month of Sdwan, or a buffalo calf in Mdgh, are 
given to the Gujardti as being unlucky. No Gaur would take them. 
At every harve-st the Gujardti takes a sruall allowance {seori) of grain 
from the threshing floor, just as does the Gaur." The divisions of the 
Gujardti are described on pp. 140-1 supra.

given of them vary as to the precise tenets of the sect. One story is that 
they disbelieve in the existence of God, and only revere living priests 
of their own persuasion. Gulab Das, though originally an Uddbi, is 
said to have fallen under the influence of one IlirdDiis, nsdclhoi Kasur, 
and about 70 years ago he discarded a faqlt-'s nudity for ordinary 
raiment, proclaiming that he had had a vision which convinced him 
that he had no religious superior, that pilgrimages were waste of time 
and temples not possessed of any sanctity. Mr. Maclngan says that 
the real founder of (he sect was an Udasi named Pritam Das who 
received some slight at a Kumbh bathing festival on the Gauges and 
so started a new sect. His principal disciple was Gulab Dds, a Sikh 
Jat, who had been a ghorchdra or trooper iu Maharaja Sher Singh's 
army and joined the new sect on the collapse of the Sikh monarchy. 
He compiled the scripture called Updes Bilds, and it is his tomb at 
Chattianwala which is resorted to by his disciples. Mr. Maclagan 
added : — 

"The Gulabdasis have thrown over asceticism and have proceeded 
to the other extreme. They originally held that all that was visible 
in the universe was God, and that there was no other. It is said that 
Gulab Das declared himself to be Biahm and many of his disciples 
believe themselves to be God ; and, properly speaking, their faith is 
that mau is of the same substance as the deity, and will be absoi Ijed 
in him, but for the most part they are looked on by their neighbours 
as deuving the existence of God altogether. They do not believe in 
a personal future life, and dispense with the veneration of saints 
and with pilgrimages and religious ceremonies of all kinds. Pleasure 
alone is their aim ; and renouncing all higher objects they seek only 
for the gratification of the senses, for costly dress and tobacco, wine 
and women, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. They are 
scrupulously neat in their attire and engage in all worldly pursuits, 
some of them being men of considerable wealth. They are said to have 
an especial abhorrence for lying, and there is certainly little or no 
hypocrisy in their tenets. In appeai-ance they vary ; some always 
wear white clothes ; others preserve the Ddasi dress ; others are clothed 
like theNirmalas; and others are distinguished by being always shaved. 
They are of course greatly distrusted and, to some extent, despised by 
their co-religionists, and their numbers are said to be on the decrease. 
The Gulabdtisis are returned mainly from Lahore and Jullundur.* 
They admit any caste to the sect, but the different castes admitted 
do not eat with each other or intermarry." 

Gulab Das abolished the hen or Sikh fashion of wearing the Lair, 
allowed his followers to smoke and only acknowledged such passages

of any other of the tribes subject to us j while their territory does not 
extend much to the east of the Sulaimans. They are divided into eleven 
clans, of which the chief are the Durkdni, Shek^ni Lashdri (a sub- 
tuman), Pitd;6, Jisatkdni, and Sabzd^ni. The last four are true Baloch 
and the last three Einds ;* the remainder of the tribe being said to have 
descended from Gorish, a p-randson of R^ja Bhimsen of ftaidard,b^d, 
who was adopted by the Baloch and married among them. He is 
said to have accompanied Humayun to Delhi, and on his return to 
have collected a Baloch following and ejected the Pathan holders from 
the present Gurchani holdings. It is not impossible that a consider- 
able number of the Lashari clan, who are not too proud of their affilia- 
tion to the Gurchani, may have returned themselves as Lashdri simply, 
and so have been included in the Lashari tribe. The whole of the 
Durkani and about half of the Lashari live beyond our border, and are 
not subject to us save through their connection with the tribe. The 



* Dames' account is different. He says that the principal part of the tribe is Dodai, the 
Syahphad/i Durkani being Rinds, and the Pitafi, Jogani and Chang are probably partly 
Rinds : while the Lash4ris (except the Gahols and Bhands) and the Jistkinis are 
Lashkis ; and the fiuhri^nis and Holawanis are Bulethis.

about iron chains which they handle when red-hot, and knives and 
daggers and needles which they thrust through their flesh. The 
author of the Qam'm-i-Isldm (a book relating to Southern India) 
gives some details of their powers : " they level blows at their backs 
with their swords, thrust a spit through their sides or into their eyes, 
both of which they take out. and put in again ; or cut ou*^ their tongiug

GwALA, an occupational term for a Hindu cowherd and shepherd. In the 
Punjab a Hindu milkman, butter-maker and cowherd is called a gwdld 
and is generally b}' caste an Ahir* ; but if a Muhammadan, he would 
be called a ghosi and is often a Gujar by tribe. The Ahir gwdlda of 
the Punjab used to buy milk largely of the gliosis for butter-making, 
of which they had the monopoly. Till the Mutiny the ghosis were 
simply milk-sellers, but alter it they took to butter-making also. 
Hindus will buy milk of a Hindu gwal'i, or a Muhammadan ghosi, but 
not of th' latter if water has been mixed with the milk, as the water 
wonld defile them. When gwalas purcha'^e milk of Muhammadan 
ghosis to make butter they are supposed to see tbe cow milked. 

GwARjt GwARiA, a nomad caste of Hindus, low in the social scale, and said 
to be broken-down Banjdras who having lost their cattle and other 
property have taken to wicker work and lead a gipsy existence. But 
other accounts make them an offshoot of the Sansis or Nats. They 
also make sirki or screens of reed and set millstones. In Hissdr 
popular legend makes them descendants of a Bhil woman by a Rdjput, 
and in this District they are settled in Hdnsi and Bhiwd,ni tahsils, 
engaged in ordinary labour as well as mat-making, and described 
as intermarrying with Banjdras. They are confined to the south-east 
Districts of the Punjab.

Halt, the skinner and dresser of hides among the Gaddi tribes. He also 
makes shoes and weaves baskets of hill bamboo, and makes green leaf 
platters. Occasionally the HaH removes nightsoil. The Hdlis are 
the most numerous and important of the menial castes throughout 
Chamba and are chiefly employed in field labour, either as farm- 
servants to the higher castes or as tenants. They also weave pattu 
or woollen stuff. The following is a list of the Hd.li gots found in

give a daughter to a BMi (who was not a Hd-li), a Dhaugri, a Rihara 
or a Sippi. Marriage is both infant and adult. A man may espouse 
his wife's sister. Sexual liceuse before marriage is not tolerated, even 
in the case of a ghar-juantrii (the ghar-jatodi or resident son-in-law of 
the plains). Halis follow the Gaddi wedding customs. The plaiting of 
the bride's hair before the bed rite is done by the bride's mother and 
is called khrdru sir. That done after it is done by her mo'.her-in-law 
and is called suhdgan sir. Polygamy is allowed and so is divorce. 
A divorcee can remarry, but a widow may not espouse her husband's 
elder brother. Widow remarriage is celebrated by the women's putting 
a dori on the bride, and her husband's placing a bdla in her nose.

(A. D. 780-885), chiefly confined to tho neighbourhood of Baghdad 
and not found in the Punjab — at least none have been entered in our 
Census returns." The modern Alil-i-Hadis follow, to some extent, the 
teachings of this school.

as a maro follower of Kabir. Bidhi Chand died in 1654 A. D. and 
was succeeded by Devi Dits, his son by his Muhammadan wife. Under 
Mnliaitimadan persecution the Handalis denied they were Sikhs of 
Nd.nak,''^ and subsequently Ranjib Singh deprived them of their lands. 
The Handali.s are now called Nii^anjanis, or worshippers of God under 
the name of Niranjan, "The Bright." They reject all Hindu ritea at 
weddings and funerals, paying no reverence to Brahmans. They have 
a special marriage rite of their own, aud at funerals perform no hiria 
harm or phicl. 

Handye, a Kamboh clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Hanifia, one of the great schools of doctrine of the Sunni Muhammadans. 
Mr. Maclagan described them as " followers of the Imdm Abu Hanifa 
(A. D. 699-769), whose doctrines are distinguished by the latitude 
allowed to private ]udgment in the interpretation of the law. The 
greater part of the Sunnis of Northern India who belong to any school 
at all belong to this. The founder of the school is known to his 
followers as the Imam Azam or Great Imam, and our figures for 
Hanifis include those who have returned themselves as adherents of the 
Imdm Azam."

Han J H A, a Muhammadan Jd,t clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery 

(doubtless Hinjrd). 
Hanjrak, a Jd^ clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar (doubtless flinjra). 

Hanni, a clan of the Kodai Karlanri Pathans, affiliated to the Mangal, but 
of Sayyid origin. With the Mangal they left their Karlanri home in 
Birmil, crossed the Sulaimdns into the modern Bannu and settled in the 
valleys of the Kurram and Gambila rivers. They were expelled by the 
BannuchiPathans a century later. Raverty, however, makes "Honai" 
and Wardag sons of Kodai's sister and adopted by him, but ho relates 
the story that a Sayyid, a pious Darvesh, Sayyid Muhammad, settled 
among the Karlarwai and other Pathd-ns and took to wife a daughter 
from the Karl^rnai and two other tnbes. The Sayyid origin of the 
Hanni thue appears undoubted. 

Hanotbah, a Brahman sept which ministers to the Malhi Jd,ts. 

Hans, a small Jat clan found in Jind, Ludhiana, Multan and Montgomery .t 
In the latter District it has a Sidh, Baba Sulaimdn, at H^ns, to whom

Harni, fern. Harniani, a highly criminal tribe, with a non-criminal minority, 
found in the Ludhi^na, JullunHur and Hoshidrpur districts. 

The Hdrnis of Ludhitina have a curious tradition of descent from one 
Najaf Khdn,a Pa^hdn, who was a friend of Shah Abdul Karim of Gilan. 
With his 8 sons Najaf Khdn accompanied the saint in the army of 
Mahmud of Ghaz'nl, receiving for his service lands at Mansuri near 
Delhi. The sons married Hindu Rajput wives and thus became Rdjputs. 
Najaf Khan's descendants settled in various parts of India^ those of his 
four younger sons in Bhatner, Uch, Dhodukut and Multiin, whence in 
1671 A. D. they migrated into Kapurthald. At Hdrnidn Khera, their 
settlement in Bikciner, the Bhattis among the Harnis quarrelled with 
the Tur and Manddhar septs, and were driven out. But they were 
accompanied by those of their women who had married into other septs 
and whose children fled with them. Another version is that famine 
drove thorn from Bikfiner. 

However this may be, the Hd^mfs became mercenaries of Rdi Kalla 
Khdn of Rdikot and he gave them several villages in jdgir. In return 
they ravaged his enemies' lands, but when the Rlii's family declined the 
Hdrnis' villages were handed over to the Kapurthald chief by Ran jit 
Singh, and they themselves were soon banished from the State on 
charges of killing kine. This was in 1818 and in 1847 they made an 
unsuccessful petition to the British authorities to be reinstated in their 
land. They were then allotted some waste land near Jagraon in the 
Ludhidna district, but it was wholly inadequate for their support and 
the Bariiis settled dovvn to a life of crime, rapidly becoming expert 
burglars and daring thieves. Almost every form of theft is attributed 
to them, but they are peculiarly skilful in the form of burglary called 
idpd which consists in jumping on to the roof of a house and enatchii)g 
the ornamentsoff its sleeping inmates. The Hdrnis of Kirf in Ludhiiiua, 
^.nd two or three villages in Jullundur and Hoshidrpur are known as 



328 Udrni gots. 

Gaunimdr* Hiirnis. Their women used to enter the houses of well-to- 
do people as servants, mistresses or even v^ives, and eventually plunder 
them in collusion with their male relatives, who obtained access to the 
house in the guise oifaqirs. 

In their own argot the Hdrnis call themselves Bdhli. Various expla- 
nations of the name Hdrni are suergested : from heri, huntsman, from her 
a herd, and from hdr a road. Others say that Rai Kalla so nick-named 
them from hdrni, a 'doe,' because Ihey were his huntsmen. Probably 
the word means thief. 

The Hdrni gots are numerous, considering the smallness of their 
numbers. The H^rni genealogies are reported to be kept by the family 
of Pir Shd,h Abdul Karim and all the information regarding them was 
obtained in 1881-82 from the late Pir Zahur-ui-Diu of Delhi, his 
descendant.

The curious point about these gots is that the forebear of each is 
specified in the table of descent from Najaf Kh^n. All these gots are 
descended from his four younger sons. To the'?e must be added the 
Gul and Pachenke ^ois found in Tappar and Kiri respectively. The 
superiority of the Bhatti got is recognised by placing several cloths 
over the corpse of one of its members on its journey to the g^ave : 
other Hdrnis have to be content with a single cloth. 

By religion the Hdrnis are strict Muhammadans of th^ Qddiria and 
Hanifia sects, it is said, and frequent the shrines of Shahi Shdh in 
Gagra, of Hassu Shdh in Tappar, of Zdhir W6M in Bodalwdld, besides 
those of Shd,h Abdul Karim in Delhi, the Chishti shrine at Ajmer and 
that of Taimur Shdh in Surat. The Hd,rnis do not, however, refrain 
from liquor. 

The male Hdrni averages 5 feet 7 inches in height, is well but not 
heavily built, wiry and perfectly healthy. In disposition the tribp is 
frank and out-spoken, and less secretive than other criminal tribes. 

♦Probably from gauni, the Harni word for road, and so meaning highwayman : or 
possibly from guni, ' theft.' 

The H^rnis of Kiri are now well-behaved, having given up thieving and taken to cultiva- 
tion. The Gaunimars are also said by their fellow Harm's to be so called tecaube they slew 
one of their women, named Gauni, en account cf her frailty. For this reason, and also 
because the Kirf Harm's ccmmittcd oflences ihiovgh their women, the oth*r H^jnis have 
few dealings with Gaunimars and rarely intermarry with them— a stoiy which is whcUy 
incredible.

Harpal, a branch of the Awdns. 

Harral, a Rajput tribe, which claims to be descended from the same 
ancestor, Rdi Bhupa, as the Kharral, but by another son ; and to be 
Punwdr Rdjputs who came from Jaisalmer to Uch, and thence to 
Kamdiia in the Montgomery district. Mr. Steedman said that in Jliang, 
where only they arc found on the left bank of tlio Upper Cliondb, 
tradition makes them a branch of tho Ahirs, and that they are almost 
the worst thieves in the district, owning large flocks and herds which 
they pasture in the central steppes, and being ba*i cultivators. Another 
account says they were originally BliutUl Jilts settled at iMatela, a 
villaije in Sh^hpur, whence they migrated under their Pir, Shjih 
Daulat. As strict Muhammadans they employ no Brahmans and will 
not eat anything left by one who does not perform the daily nimdz, 
Marriagre withiti the tribe is preferred, but is allowed with Bains, 
Gondal, Sindhan Jd^s, La,Iis, Laks, Kharrals, etc. In Montgomery the 
Harral (Hail) are classed as a Jat (agricultural) tribe. 'J'hey are all 
Muhammadans in this District. 

Hasal, an agricultural clan found in Shdbpur. 

Hasam, a 3i,\ clan (agricultural) found in Mult^n. 

Hasani, see Sayyid. 

Hasan Khel, a well known sept of the Adam Khel Afridis, which with the 
Jawakki occupies the range between Kohdt and Peshd,war, from Akor, 
west of the Kohdt Pass to the Khatak boundary. The Hasan Khel 
hold the southern border of the Peshdw&r district. 

HasnanAj a clan of the Sials. 

Hassani, a Baloch tribe of uncertain origin which once held a large part of 
the country now held by the Marris, by whom they wore all but de- 
stroyed. A fragment now forms a clan among the Khetrans near tho 
Han Pass. Possibly Pathan by origin but more probably Khetran, the 
remaining Hassanis speak Balochi. 

Hassanzai, one of the three main sections of tho Jaduni (Gaduos) in Hazara, 
settled in and round Dhamtaur and in the Mangal and Bagra tracts. The 
obsolete chieftainship of the Jaduns was vested in a family of this 
section, 

Hatano, an Ardfn clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Hathab, a J&\ clan (agricultural) found in Multdn. 

HatIkhel. — The most numerous, orderly and wealthy clan of tho Ahmadzai 
branch of the Wazir Pathdns settled in Bannu. It, is divided into two 
main branches, the Kaimal and Idal, tho Kaimalkhel outnumbering the 
Idalkhel by four to one. The Kaimalkhel has three chief sections, 
Ali- or Khaidar Khel 'with a Patolkhel sub-section mostly found in the 
hills), Musa and Purj/ia Khels — all settled in the Marwat plain. The 
Idalkhel have four sections Bai, Bakkar, Isa and Kaimal (II) — also 
settled in the plain. The Sirkikhel is a small clan, now practically a

brarcli of tbo Hatikhel, with three main sections, Tolila, Bahla and 
Shuni, all settled in the Bannu Thai. 

Hatiak, a tribe of Jdts found in Gujrat and so called because they used to 
practise female infanticide. They migrated from Shdhpur to Gujrdt in 
Akbar's time. 

Hattab, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

Hattiahi, a sept of the Bhattis, in Sialkot, descended from Bhoni, 7th in 
descent from Bhat^i. One of Bhoni's descendants, Uai Danu, in whose 
family the custom of female infanticide prevailed, had a daughter who 
was j-escued by a Brahman and kept by him f(>r four years, but at 
last, thinking that her father would be certain to kill her, if he ever 
found her, he put her to death himself, and the sept has become known 
as Hattitlii, lit. * one guilty of killing a cow ' or a Brahman. 

Haulb, a se| t of BrHlimans who migrated with the Mairs from Jummu and 
still receive small fees at weddings, etc., from the Chaudhridl of Ohak- 
wiil. The weighman's JDusiness of that town is in their hands, but they 
are still recognised by other Brahmans as of that caste. Their name is 
ascribed to their former dread {haul) of forcible conversion to Islam. 

Hazara, a race usually but erroneously styled Pa^hdn. They are almost 
certainly Mongol Tartars, and derive their name from hazara, the 
Persian equivalent of the Turki yning or " legion." Settled m their 
present abodes by Changiz Khiln they hold the Paropamisus of the 
ancients, from Kabul and Ghazui to Her^t and from Kandahiir to 
Balkh. Owing to their strict rule of intermarriage they have retained 
their physical and physiognomic characteristics and are " as pure 
Mongols as when they settled over 600 years ago with their families, 
their flocks and their worldly possessions.'^ In the interior of their 
country they were almost wholly independent until subdued by the late 
Amir Abdur Rahman of Afghanistan. They do not give their name 
to the Hazdra District of the North-West Frontier Province, nor 
apparently to the Chach-Hazdra in the Attock tahsil.* The Hazdras 
are not settled in the Punjab, but are found in it as labourers and 
also enlist in Pioneer regiments. All are Shias by sect, and in con- 
sequence regarded as heretics by the Sunni Afghans. They are fully 
described in Bellew's Races of Afghdnistdii. 

HiMEAJi, an obscure Bindu sect found in Multdo. 

Hambi, Hesi, a low caste of professional musicians and dancers found in 
Kullu and the Simla Hill States. Their women perform as dancing 
girls. They appear to be also called Be^a (or the Bedas are a group 
of the Hesis). In Spiti the Hesi appears to be also called Hesir (see 
Chahzang) and Beta (iu correctly Batia) and there they form a low 
caste, which is returned as Hindu, and which, like the Lohdr, is 
excluded from social intercourse with the other classes. The Hesi is 
called * the 18ih ca&te/t or the odd caste which is not required, for no

219. At the same time many of the followers of Guru Gobind Singh have 
put themselves down as Hazuris, the number being 287,548 Kesdharis and 6,044 
Sahidharis. Hazuris are those Sikhs who have paid a visit to Haziir Salub m 
Hyderabad Deccan (where Guru Gobind Singh breathed his last) and have been 
initiated there. It is really a title of religious merit similar to that of Haji amongst 
the Muliammadans (».e., those who have made a pilgrimage to Mecca), but the 
initiation at the Hazur Sahib is supposed to confer great religious sanctity, at the 
same time imposing certain restrictions. The orthodox Hazuris are supposed to 
^0 about in yellow or blue garments and very often cook their own food, eating 
trom nobody else's hands. The orthodox type is, however, on the wane.

imply that it is m«an and paltry. In Lahul and 8piti tho Hesi is the 
only class that owns no land, and a proverb says : ' The Beda no land 
and the dog no load.' Tlia men play tho pipes and kettla-'drum and

indefinite period.

Hijra, (I) an important Jclt clan, i.^. Hinjra : (2) a eunuch, also called 
hhunsd, khojd, khiLHni, viukkannas, or, if a dancing eunuch dressed 
in woman's clothes, zankha. Fornierly employed by chiefs and 
people of rank to act a^ custodians of their female apartments and 
known as khwdja-sard, nnwdh ovnizir, they aro still found in R^jput^na 
in this capacity. In the Punjab tho kijra is usually a deraidr, i.e., 
attached to a dera. He wear.-i b ingles on his wrists, and other 
feminine ornam3nts. If dressed in white, he wears no turban, but a 
shawl, and his hands are stained with henna. Rijras affect tho names 
of men, but talk among themselves like women. They visit people's 
houses when a son has been born to dmce and play upon tho flute, 
receiving in return certain dues in c ish an 1 cloth. In -^ome villages 
they are found collected in chaukinyf and, like singing-girls, are 
bidden to weddings. 'J^hey act as butfo)ns. and are skilful dancers. 
lu a d^ra a chehi succeo Is his guru, his accession being celebrated by 
a feast to the other inmates of t;ho dera. Tne hljr-is are all Muham- 
madans, and especially affect Shaikh Abdul Qidir Muhi-ud-Din 
Jilani. At the Muharram they make fuzlis. Hindus joining tho 
fraternity become Muhammadans. 

Tho eunuchs of tho Punjab have divided the Province into refi;ular beats from which hirt 
or dues are collected. IVuiipat contains a tj'pical Hijra fraternity. In thai town thej' livo

names, dress like women and call one another by su:h namns as )iii.<i. ' moihor's sister,' 
phuphi, ' aunt," ani so on. Th^ pjrmanont res'donts of this abolo only number 7 or 8, but 

• As regards this name the following tale is told : — 

A Minisi happened to meet some childrcu of the M.4n, Bhullar and Her tribes pasturing 
cattle. Those of the two former tribes wore in chirue of boys, those of the latter in 
charge of girls, and so he nsksd them which of their tribes was tho chief. Tho boys 
answered ironically that the Poraw41, who had sent their cattle out in charge of girls, were 
chief. Owing to their custom of so doing tho Her Jits were only regardel as half a tribe, 
and the ether two tribes refused to marry with them. The Dhariwil are also cjUledPllor. 

j The chauki appears to be much the same as a dera. 



832 Eunuchs, 

an ura or anniversary is lield at which a fairly large number collect. They also observe the 
Holi and Daselira. But the largest gathering takes place on the occasion of a gadi nathini 
or succession to the ollice of headman, when some 200 assemble. 

It is commonly asserted that no one has ever seen the funeral of a eunuch ; and the super- 
stitious belief is that when about to die they disappear. They are, as a rule, long-lived, 
well-built, and, being so few, deaths among them cannot be frequent. Eunuchs dread a 
dead body, and when one of them ilies none of them dare approach the corpse. All that 
they will do is to cry an i weep like women, and it devolves by custom on their Badhi 
neighbours to wash the dead body and carry it to the graveyard As tht» eunuchs are 
looked upon as impure, the Bidhis never a imit that they serve as their coffin-bearers and 
the popular superstition is thus strengthened. 

Eunuchs are admitted into the fraternity from all castes ; e. g., Sayyid, Shaikh, Gujar, 
Julaha, etc. One of them. Sahib Jan, a pious man, who died at the age of loo in Mecca, 
was a Brahman. All are, or become, Muhammadans. They have a rite of initiation, which 
they term ckddar urhna (donning the sheet;, but the proceedings are kept secret* None of 
the eunuchs now in Panipat are natives of the town. Two or three men of Panipat who 
became eunuchs had to go to Patiiila for initiation and to earn a livelihood. It is admitted 
by the eunuchs that no person is born a "i/ra, and the common belief that children are so 
born seems to be wrong ; none can say that he has ever seen sui^h a child.! It appears to be 
a fact that eunuchs are permanently unsexed, and it was vauntingly asserted that, however 
rich their food may be, they are never ' intoxicated." They say : — " We are broken vessels 
and fit for nothing ; formerly we guarded the harems of kings — how could they admit us 
into the zandna if there was the least danger ? We go into the houses of all, and never has 
a eunuch looked upon a woman with a bad eye : we are like bullocks." How this is brought 
about may be guessed, but the eunuchs say they get recruits from the zandna or eanhha 
class, who are impotent even before initiation. A meal known as Mir buchri ki khkhri has 
to be eaten by every initiate, and its effect is supposed to render a man impotent for life. 
What the ingredients of this meal are no one knows, and the eunuchs themselves are reluc« 
tant even to mention its name, saying that it was a myth, and who would dare to administer 
such drugs now-a-days ? 

Another institution in Panipat is the zandna mandli, which comprises some 25 or 30 
persons and is a well-known class or circle in the town. It consists of adult and young men, 
who flirt and pietend to imitate the gait of women. They learn to dance and sing, nnd pass 
their days in indolence. They can be recognised by their muta'k chdl (behaving like females'*. 
Each of them has a " husband." For some years past the zand7ias have celebrated the Holi as 
a carnival. They assume female names, by which they are called in their own circle. Most of 
them are beardless youth ; those who have beards shave them. Ndz nakhra (flirtation) becomes 
their second nature. There is no distinction between Hindu and Musalman in the mandli, 
but most of its members are the latter : they wear narrow p«ijd?Ha,s and a cap. In Delhi 
also the zandnas are a recognised class : they hire Aof/ia.s or the upper storeys of shops 
like prostitutes They are invited to wedding parties, where they dance and act as 
buffoons (-nakkdl), and iheir fees are high. Their ' friends ' are ttakkds (watermen,), kunjrds 
(vegetable-men), and other low castes. The eunuchs speak of them tauntinglj', and say 
that all the members of the zandna-mandli are impotent men given to sodomy, though 
some of them are married and have children. " They are prostitutes," remarked a eunuch 
" if we acted like them, how could our jujmdns allow us to come near them ? They have 
deprived the prostitutes of their means of livelihood : we are not such." 

Asked why they do not get more recruits from the zandnax, the eunuchs say that any 
such attempt is resented by the relations of the laundas (boys); but if a stranger boy 
comes and asks for admission they initiate him. It is alleged that the number of the 
zandnas is on the increase in P4nipat. 

A. eunuch once initiated very seldom deserts the "brotherhood." If a c^.e/a goes away 
no other eunuch can keep him without repaying his guru the expenses of his initia- 
tion and keep. And if he goes to the Khojas the eunuchs are powerless. The Khojas 
are a separate class who live in villages. They are married men Aviih families, but earn 
their livelihood by levying birt fees like eunuchs. They employ a eunuch to dance for 
them and play on the drum after him. If they cannot get a eunuch they get a boy of their 
own to dance. 

The eunuchs in Panipat are fairly well off. Their house is full of furniture and 
necessaries, and they levy birt or charitable fees on certain occasions. At a wedding or the 



* Probably for excellent reasons : see the next foot-note. 

t Eunuchs are undoubtedly made by mutilation. There is a custom of placing 5 jice 
imder the foot of the boy who is to be operated on. Apparently this is done to prevent pain 
as a similar custom is believed to be follo^'cd at births.

birth of a son they go to the family concerned, dance at the houaa and sing, and receive 
Re. l-i-0, or sometimes less. The zaynindars do not acknowledge them as their Aamin* 
and they have no claims upon them ; but persons of the lower castes, such as Telis. Rains, 
Jhi'wars, etc, dare not refuse them their foes, ;ind every shopkeeper has to pay them one 
pice in the year. 
Eunuchs do not appear to be employed in mosques in tho Punjab.* 
HiNDAL, a Muhamraadan tribe found iti Montgomery (doubtless Handal). 

HiNDKi, a generic term, half contemptuous, applied to all Muhammadans, 
who being of Hindu origin speak Hindko and have been converted to 
Isldm in comparatively recent times. \n Bannu the term usually 
denotes an Awiln or Jat cultivator, but in a wider sense it inclufles all 
Muhammadans who talk Hindi, Panjd,bi or any dialect derived from 
them. The local proverbs t aro not complimentary to the Hindki. One 
says : — 

(a) *' If a Hindki cannot do you any harm, he will leave a bad smell 
as he leaves you." 

And again — 

(6) " Though you duck a Hindki in the water he will come up with 
a dry seat (hence he is lucky).'* 

(c) " Get round a Pathan by coaxing; but wave a clod at a Hindki." 
{d) " Though a Hindki bj your right arm, cut it olf."

HiNJRA, HiNJRAi, HiNjRAONt (or, iucorrecfly, Hijrd), (1), an important J^t 
tribe, indigenous to the Gujrdnwilla Bdr. Once a pastoral tribe, perhaps of 
aboriginal extraction, they own 37 villages in Gujrdnwjlla which is their 
home, but have spread botli east and west under the hills. They claim 
to be Saroha Kdjputs by origin and say that their ancestor Hinjrilon 
came from the neighbourhood of Hi.?S{lr to the HilGzabdd parqana in 
Gujrdnwala and founded a city called Uskhab, tho ruins of which still 
exist. Their immediate ancestors were Mai and Dhol,^ and they say 
that half their clans still live in the Hissdr country. 

•Tho Persians in remote times were waited ^by eunuchs as we learn from Herodotus 
(lib. 6) and some attribute to them their invention. But Amniianus Marcelliuus (lib 14) 
ascribes it to Semiramis. In .li-ZsZam tho employment of such persons about the mosque 
is a bida,tt or custom unknown in the time of the Prophet. It is said to have arisen from 
the following three consideration.s : lliat (») these people are concentrated in their profession • 
(m) they must see and touch .strange women at the .shruies : and (ii.) the shrines are 
harim or sacred, having adyta which are kept secret from the prying eyes of men and 
therefore, should be served by eunuchs. It is strange that the Roman Catholic Church as 
well as the Mo.slem mosque, shouhl have admitted such an abomination Though the 
principal of the mosque, or xhnikh al-harim, is no longer a neuter... , his mub or deputy 
is a black eunuch, the chief of the ay/)au(i<, upon a pay of 5,ouo piastres a month. From 
Burton's Pilgrimage to al-M(ulinah aud Mecca, Vol. I, p. 371, Burton goes on to describe the 
organisation of the attendants of the mosque at MeJfnah who are all eunuchs

Raverty, on the other hand, writes that Jdiu or Jd,!, son of Nulzi, had 
by liis three wives seven sons, viz., Isd, Ali and Danlat, by the first : 
Suiibal and Pindar or Punddr, by the second ; and iMarhal and Jalai or 
Jakai, by the third. But anotliei account giv<^s Jd,m an eio-hth son 
Khan, and ad^is that Jciin had two brothers, Bai and KIwiko. From 
the latter are descended tlie Sahrangs of Midnwflli, the Maliyars, Mi- 
clian Khel, the Musidni Isil Khel, and thn Kuiidi*. who are coulined to 
Tank. The earlier history of the ls<i Khel belongs to that of the 
Nifizis, but, it may be noted, they were in possession of the Khushdb 
pargayia of the Sind-Sagar Sarkar before the close of the 16th century, 
and prior to that period Babar allude^s to their village of Is^ Khel as 
concerned in a night attack on his camp in 1505 A. D. 

(2) There is also an Is4 Khel subdivision of the Tarakzai branch of 
the Bar Mohmands on the Peshawar border.

IsAZAi, one of the principal clRns of the Yusofzai Pathdns, They hold 
the north-east slopes of Mahabnn and the mnuntainons C' untry on 
hoth sides of the Indus in Haz^ra and the Gadun valley. They have 
three clans, Hassanzai, Akazai and Medu Khel in Hazjiia, and in 1907 
elected a Khan to their vacant Khanship.t 

IsEKE, a Kharral clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery.

IsoT, Sot, an offshoot of the great Panni tribe of the Afghans which 
formerly hold a great part of Siwi or Slhist^n. Their lands lie west 
of die Jafir Pathans on the Dera Ismail Khiin border. 

IsPERKA, one of the five clans of the Ahmadzai branch of the Wazir Pa^hdna 
settled in Bannu. its main divisions arc the Muhammad Kiiel, who 
now rank as an independent clan, and Sudankhel and Saldikhei who 
alone are now termed Isperka. The tribal land of the Muhammad 
Khel is divided into four tarafs or shares of wiiich one is held by the 
Shudakai, an affiliated Khel from the remnant of some old hill tribe 
which cannot trace de-^cent from Isporka. The Sudankhel has four 
sections, Bagldan, Bokul, Kundi and Bliairat, with a fifth called Dhir 
affiliated hamsdyas of another stock. 

Ithwal, the Ithwal or Uthwal, according to the late Sir Denzil Ibbetson, 
seem to be found chiefly in Ambala, Ludhiana, Jullundur, and the ad- 
joining territory of Patijila. But unless two distinct names have been 
confused, they have a curiously lar^c colony in Delhi, which appears 
to be completely separated fiom that of Ambala. They are said to 
be descended from a Surajbansi Rajput called Mahilraj who received 
the nickname of Unthwdl from his love for camel-riding.

east. The last Sultdn of Swdt and of the Gibaii tribe was Awes, a 
son of Sultln Pakhal,* whose subjects, a Tdjik race known as Dihkiins 
or Dihgang, were expelled by the m)dern Swati PatMns from Swat.

as the fi'ontier of Badakh'^hdn after wliich they are suddenly lost

Jain, a generic term for all who affect the Jain religion. It is now 
recogni'^ed that the Jain faith is older than Buddhism and that 
Buddha's doctrines were probably adaptations or developments of 
Jain tenets. A. full account of the J^iins and their tenets would be 
entirely beyond the scope of this article, and the following accounts of 
the Jains as a religious community, in part from the pea of Ldla Jas- 
want Rai, a Jain of Hoshidrpur, are reproduced as giving, as far as 
possible in the words of a Jain, an account of their representatives in 
the Punjab. 

" The Jains ai'e so called as being the followers of the JinasJ, Arhata 
or Tirthankaras who were 24- in number, but they are also called 
Saraogis, a corrupt form of Sharawaka or 'disciple ' (sewak). Thoy are 
recruited from various groups of the Biinias, such as the Aggarwdl, 
Oswdl, Shrimdl and Khanderwal, the last three of wh')m are also called 
Bhabras — a corrupt form of Bhao-bhala (from hkao — motive and 
hhala — good) or 'those of good intent '. Their chief aim is to injure 
no living creature and to attain nirvana or peace. Among the Jains 
it is A strict rule that no flesh or intoxicant shall be touched. 

As a reliofious community, the Jains are divided into two great sects, 
viz., the Swetambara and Digambara. 

SwETAMBARA— The Swe'ambaras worship idds, vvhich are often 
adorned with gold and silver ornaments set with jewels, such as 

*Frorn whom Pakhli in Hazara derives its name. He was a descendant of a Sultan 
Bahr^m.

j The word Jina is derived from the Sanskrit root Ji— to conquer, hence Jain meang 
* conqueror ', 



The Sioetamharn Jains. 841 

Mukta, Angia, etc. They have their eight sacred claya, viz., tho 
Paj asanas, beginning from tho 12th hadi to tbe 4th audi (both days 
inclusivej in Bl;d,'lon, tho 8th day being called Chhamachhri, the 
holiest day of tlio Jains. During tho-<e holy days, they spend much 
time in reading and listening to their scriptures, the Sufrag, and much 
money in performing certain ceremonies in their temples and in saving 
the lives of living creatures. Daring the^o days a fast is kept ; some 
fasting for one day, some for 2, 3, 4 and sf)mo for all the eight days." 

Mr. Fagan writes that the Swetambaras believe that a woman can 
attain salvation [mnkti), while other Jains hold tliat she must 6rst be 
born again as a man. In Hissiir the principal caste which follows the 
Swetainbara doctrine is the Oswdl Bania. 

The Swetambaras have ascetics who are thus initiated. A man who 
wislu'S to become an ascetic must first live for some time with an 
ascetic and become fully ncquainted with the austerities which he will 
have to undergo. On an auspicious day the Saraogis of the neighbour- 
hood are invited. The candidate is then fir^-t rubbed with batna* 
(batlcy flour, oil and turmeric), and then bathed. He is now dressed 
in handsome apparel, and, seated on an elephant, is carried in 
proces.-ion throuu;}! the hdzdr to a Jai.i temple or such other place as 
may have been made beforehand to res^^mble a Jain temple. There his 
head is shaved, and his tutor or giira, after performing certain 
religious rites, afivos him saffron clothes, tho ugha or rajoharna (a kind 
of brushmg stick), the munfi patti, (a piece of cloth placed before the 
lips when speaking or reading), patras (wooden utensils) and a stick. 
He accepts these thino;s joyfully and makes the five following vows 
{pancha mahahratas) of the Jain monk : — 

1. 1 take the vow not to destroy life (ahinsa). 

2. I take the vow not to lie {asatya). 

3. 1 take the vow not to take that which is not given {asteya). 

4. I take the vow to abstain from sexual intercourse [brahni' 

chary a). 

5. I take tho vow to renounce all interest in worldly things, 

especially to call nothing my own {aparigraha). 

Thus he becomes a monk and is often styled a samhegi sddhu, 
A Stldhu has to walk barefoot ; to use no conveyance when 
travelling, to take no food or drink after sunset; to abstain from 
touching a female ; to refuse to accept uncooked vegetables, and only 
to eat certain of them if cooked ; to use wooden utensils ; never to 
prepare his own meals, but, always to bei^ food of his followers -^nd 
others ; always to drink boiled water; never to give an opinion on any 
worldly matter ; and never to possess a farthing. In short, he has to 
break off all conuoction with the world and lead the life of a strict 
hermit. 

The chief aim of the sddhu is to liberate himself from the bondage of 
karma and thus obtain salvation. 

In Hissdr the priests of the Swetambaras are however called jati. 
* As if he were a bridegroom. 



342 ^6 Dhundia Jains. 

The sddhu^ is in reality aa ascetic of a different order to the jati 
and their practices vary in important points. 

Both orders admit females, widows as well as unmarried women. The 
main rules of the two orders are noted below : — 

Sddhm. J<iiis. 



1. A sddhu must touch nothing feminine 
whether human or animal. If he do so in- 
advertently he must undergo certain rites of 
expiation and be re-initiated. Conversely, a 
sddhwi must touch nothing male. 

2. The sddhus have no proselytizing zeal 
and admit no disciple who is not desirous of 
entering the order. 

3. A sddhu. must not touch coin, nor 
anything of metal or made of a combination 
of metals. All their ordinary utensils are of 
wood, 

4. The sddhus are itinerant monks, never 
halting at any place save to recover from 
fatigue, regain strength, or to preach to the 
people, 

5. A sddhu must not use a razor or scis- 
sors and his hair therefore remains unshorn. 
The hair of the beard may however be 
broken, if it grow too long, but not more 
than twice a year, 

0. A sddhu may not wear shoes or ride. 

7, A sddhu may not travel by night. 



1. The jatis have no such restrictions. 



2. The jatis are active in making converts 
and sometimes buy children of destitute 
parents making them disciples {chelaa). 

3. The jatis have no such rules. 



4. The ?af»s live permanently in updsaraa 
and do not regard itineration as a religious 
duty. 

5. The jatis have no such rule. 



6. The jatis may do both. 

7. This is permitted to a jati. 



i. Among jatis the men and women have 
separate quarters (in the updsaras) . 



8. Sddhus and sddhiuis travel together, 
lodge in the same house, and study together 
by night. I 

The sddhus are admittedly superior in religious merit to the jatis, 
and if a jati meet a sddhu the former makes obeisance to the latter. 
A sddhu may however read the sutras with a learned jati. 
In Bfkaner the sddhus have three sects : — Dhundia, Samegi and Terapanthi. 

Of the 84 sects or orders of the Jain priesthood or Samegi sddhus only 
four appear to be represented in Bah^walpur and these are the Kharatara, 
Tapa, Kanwala and Launka gachhas. There is an updsra or monastery 
of jati gurus or celibate priests of these orders at Mau jgarh, and pil- 
grimages are also made to the updsras at Bikdner, Rani, R4jgarh, 
Suj^ngarh, Choru, Bidaspur, Sard^r Shahr and Rajab Desar in Bika- 
ner Slate. Updsras are to be found at every locality where Oswdla live 
in any numbers. 

Dbdndia. Alexander Kinlooh Forbes writes in his Hindu Annals of 
the ProvincB of Gujrdt in Western India, that " this sect did not arise, it 
is said , before Sanibat 1700 (A.D. 1664)^\ They neither use temples nor 
worship idols, they do not believe in all the Jain Scriptures, but only 
in 32 scriptures and of even these in the text only. They disapprove of 
commentaries, etc., and condemn the learning of Sanskrit grammar. 



* Feminine jddftw;i, ; Jatiia also the feminine form. 



The Digamhara Jains. 343 

They too have eighfc sacred days, pajwsanas. The DImndia ascetic is a 
disgusting object, he wears a screen ol: cloth, munh-patti, tied over his 
mo'ith, his body aud clothes are filthy an 1 covernd with vermin. The 
Dhunlia is als ) called sudhmdrgi or thinakbdai. He is initiated hke 
a sambegi sddhu with some differences in certain rites. The Dhundiaa 
are divided into several sub-divisions such as Bdls-tola, Jiva Pauthi, 
Ajfva Panthi, Tera Panthf, etc. 

These sub-divisions originated in this way :— The Lanka sub-division 
of the Swetambaras was split up into three gadiis or schools, viz., 
Nagari, Gujardti, and Uttar^dhi (northern). Under the influence of 
22 gurus the Nagari became a large sect, distinct from the Swetambara 
and indeed from all the other Jains. It became known as the Bais- 
tola and eventually DhunHia. This schism occurred in 1909 Sambat. 
In 1817 Sarabat, however the Dhundias were in turn split up by the 
defection of the Terapanthi or "sect of the 13." It has had 5 (/urwa 
whose seat is R^jnagar in Bikdner. 

The Biis-tola reverences the 32 Sutras of Mahd,vfr which form the 
Jain scriptures, but the Terapanthis have a scripture of their own 
consisting of 52 sZo/bas, They refuse to protect an animal from the 
attacks of another, but the Bdis-tola rise to even that height of regard 
for life. The Terapanthis are on the whole more advanced, if more 
heterodox, than the Bdls-tola. 

DiqambAras. — The Digambaras worship naked idols and their monks 
are also naked. They also keep fasts and have eight sacred days, called 
athdi, which occur every fourth month — in Asdrha, Kdrtika and 
Phalgun of each year. They have besides ten sacred days (called 
the Das Lakshni), from Bh^don sudi 5th to 14th. Many of their tenets 
agree with those of the Swetambaras. They are divided into two 
divisions, Bis- Panthi and Tera-Panthi. 

The Blspanthi reverence the 24 arhats, the Guru and the Shdstras, 
while the Terapanthi deny that there is any gurit save the Sh^stras 
themselves. "They clothe their idols, worship seated, burn lamps 
before them, but present no flowers or fresh fruit to them, holding it to 
be a sin to take away oven vegetable life, though they will eat vege- 
tables if any one will give them ready cut and prepared for cooking, 
while the Bispanthi worship standing before naked idols, and refuse to 
burn lamps before them." 

According to Professor Wilson they both deny the supremacy of a 
guru and dispense with the ministrations of Brahmans, and according 
to the same authority the Bispauthis are the orthodox Digambaras, 
while the Terapanthis are dissenters. The Bispanthis arc the more 
orthodox, and they are divided into four sub-sects — Nandi, Sen, Singh, 
and Bir — caUed after tlie names of their Rishis. The Terapanthi 
appear to be far the more numerous of the two. 

The Jains in His8d,r are thus described by Mr. P. J. Fagan : — ■ 

"The Jains appear to revere the gods of the Hindu pantheon, 
but reject the divine origin of the Vedas. Their supreme deity is 
Nirank^r, corresponding apparently with the Hindu N^rdin, but their 



844 The Jain sects. 

immediate objects of reverence and worship are the 24 arhats or saints 
who have obtained final union [mukti] with Nirankdr. They do not 
appear to reverence or feed the Brahmans, but they have sddhus or 
priests of their oryn, and their pun on meritorious conduct consists to a 
large extent in worshipping Nirankdr and in feeding the sddhus. They 
do not wear the jane o or sacred thread, they have a certain amount of 
reverence for the cow ; bathing is not considered any part of their 
worship, nor do they appear to reverence the Ling, the symbol of Siva. 
Their scriptures consist of the 32 Sutras written by Malid^vir, the last 
arhat. The leading principle of coudnct inculcated by their religion 
is abstention not alone from taking human life but from causing harm 
to any kind of living creature {jiv) ." 

Mr. Fagan describes the Jains as " divided into two main sections 
Mandirpanthi (or Pujari) and Dhundia-panthi, the former being suc- 
cessors and representatives of the original Jains while the latter are a 
schismatic offshoot. The Mandirpanthis are again sub-divided into 
* Swetarabaras and Digambara"/ the ancient sects, of which the 
former are the ' white-clothed ' and the latter the * sky-clad ' or naked, 
though they also wear tawny clothes. " The Swetambaras/' to quote 
from the late Sir Denzil Ibbetson, are somewhat less strict in their 
observances than the Digambaras : their ascetics will feed after 
sunset^ are said to use wine, and will eat out of a dish and from 
the hands of any Hindu : whereas a Digarabara devotee must have 
his food placed in his hand by another of the faith. Various stories 
are current as to the origin of the two sects. One account relates 
how in the time of Chandra Gupta a famine fell upon the country 
of Ujain, and how a part of the Jains there consented to accept 
clothes, without which they were not allowed to enter into the city 
to beg for alms, while the other section emigrated southwards rather 
than abandon the nakedness which had till then been the common 
rule of the faith. But the older and better account is that of the 
23rd and 24th arhats, Parasnd^th and Mahd,vir, who were probably 
real persons and the actual founders of the Jain religion : the former 
wore clothes, while the latter did not, and the disciples of each adopted 
the example of their leaders." 

' The least punctilious of the Jains are sometimes known by the 

r name of Mdrgi: they follow the path (mdrg) of the Jains in some 

"•^ particulars, such as in their scrupulous regard for animal life, but 

• ' / jri other respects revere Brahmans and follow the greater number 

of Hindu prevalent practices. The word Mdrgi, however, is also 

used as an euphemism for Bdm-margi — those who follow the left-hand 

path. 

The Bistory of the Jain Sects. 

The Jains, as a body, have a remarkably complete historif^al and 
telia-ious literature which has been, or is being, thoro'jghly studied by 
German scholars. Unfortunately the results are hardly yet available 
in a form intelUgible to any but specialists. Further, the Digambara 
tenets, which are of great interest, are also contained in an extensive lit- 
erature, but as their pandits preserve the old-world hostility to printing, 
little has as yet been published regarding them. 



![%e Jam pontiffs. dib 

To make clear what follows it shonld be noted that the 42 semi-divine 
Jinas, whoso series ends with Mahdvira, Maliabir, {'the great hero'), were 
succeeded hyaline of human teachers, called setri5,aterm we in tiy translate 
by 'pontiff.' Of those the first was, according to one sect (that of the 
Kharatara gachha), Mahavira himself, and his first disciple was Gotama 
(Buddha), who did not however succeed liiiu, Sa<iharman becomiufr the 
second pontiff. The other sect, the Tapa gachha, regards Sudharman 
as tha 6rst pontiff. Both these sects trace, tliough with some differ- 
ences, the pontifical succession down to Uddhyotana, who founded the 
84 gachhas'^ of the Jain ( ? caste) which still exist, and was 3dth in 
succession from Mahdvira. 

After the time of Uddhyotana there are two distinct lines of pontiffs. 
One, reverenced by the Kharatara gachha, is a succession of pontiffs 
who all (with the exception of Abhayadeva who was a leper) bear the 
title of Jina.t I'he other, accepted by the Tapa gachhas, boars various 
titles, and was founded by Jagach Chandra, 44th in succession, accord- 
ing to the Tapa gachha records, from Sudharman. These two historical 
gachhas or sects of the Jains have apparently been "lost sight of in the 
maze of sects and orders into which the community has become divided 
in more recent times. 

The origin of the Digambara and Swetambara sects is very obscure. 
According to one account the former sect was founded by Nataputta 
Nirgrantha (or Nigantha), who has been identified with Mahdbir 
himself. Indeed it has been held that Mahdbir only reformed an 
ancient order of naked ascetics. According to the Kharatara records 
the Digambaras arose in the time of the 18th pontiff, Chandra, whereas 
the Tapa gach>-ia account is that the name of the Nirgrantha sect was 
changed to Kotika gachha as early as the time of the 9th pontiff. It 
thus seems likely that the Digambaras represent an older phase of 
belief than even Jainism itself, but, however this may be, it ia certain 
that in the time of Bhadrabahu, the 27th in succession from Gotama, 
the Digambaras and Swetambaras had finally separated. The Digam- 
baras forthwith split up into various sects or rather orders under the 
following pontiffsj : —

The Digambara orders. 

The successor of Guptigupta founded the great order of the Nandi 
Sangha, sakha, or school, which from its importance appears to have 
overshadowed the three minor orders founded by his other disciples 

* These include the Khandewal, Agarwal, Srimal, Vanawal or Oswil ' <jots ' or gachhas 
according to Wilson; Religious Sect.i of the Hindtis, p. 345. 

t Probably as re- incarnations of the Jinas or arhats. The Tapa gachhas by denying to 
their pontiffs that title may signify their rejection of the doctrine that they rc-incarnato 
the arhats.

The Digambavas insist strongly on the essential unity in matters of 
doctrine and observance b'etween all four orders, who.^e members alone 
can consecrate images. Collectively these four orders appear to be 
known as the Saraswati gachha, though perhaps that term is in strict- 
ness only a synonym of the Nandi Sangha. So too they appear to 
be called Kundakuudanwaya, or ' the line of Kundaknnda,' their fifth 
pontiff. In some obscure way the three minor orders would seem to be 
subordinate to the chief order, the Nandi iSangha, as they all four owe 
allegiance, it appears, to the same pontiffs. 

Later sects. 

Subsequent to the rise of these four orders or sakhas, there arose 
four other sanghas, viz., the Mula, Kashtha, Mathura and Goppa 
Sangha. But Mula Sangha means literally 'the Original Communion/ 
and the term is also used of the whole Jain community and of the 
Digambaras before they spilt up into sects. 

Still later ihere arose various panthis, such as the Visa-, Tera-, 
Gumana, and Pota-Panthis, i.e. those who worship a book fpustaka) 
in lieu of an image. And again it is said that, in Sambat 1709, 
Lavaji of the Lnmpaka sect,§ together with one Dharmadasa, a cotton- 
printer, founded the mouth-covering Dhundakas. These divided into 
22 sections (presumably the Bais-tola), one of which was called 
Dhanaji. Dhana's disciple was Budhara, and the latter^s dit^ciple 
Raghundthji, whose disciple Bhishma founded the Ternpanthis or 
Mukhabandhas (mouth-coverers). Whether these sects are confined to 
the Digambaras or not it is impossible to say. 

But even these do not exhaust the list of sects. The Kharatara 
gachha records enumerate ten gachhabhedas, the last of which was 
founded as late as Sambat 1700, but whether these still exist or not is 
not known. Indeed we do not know if they are sects or orders* or

merely theological schools. The Tapa gachhas also have various divi- 
sions, such as tho Vrihad- or Vada- (Vata-) gachha, so called beoause 
Uddyotana coneecratod Sarvedevasari, or according to some, 8 auris, 
uuder a large fig-tree [vata). 

The Jain tenets. 

The Jain Jinas, Tittliankaras or Arhantas wore 24 in number, each 
having his 8ef)arato chinha or cognizance and being (Hstinguished by 
the colour of his com])lexion. Images of one or more Arhantas figure in 
every Jain temple. Thus Risdhha-Ndtha or Adimitha has as his coo-niz- 
ance the elephant, Sambhava has the horse, Sumati the curlew, and 
Other Arhantas the lotus, the stvdstika (doubtless a sun-symbol), the 
moon, a crocodile, tl-o srivatf^a (like a four-leaved shamrock in sliape), 
a rhinoceros, a buffalo, a tortoise, or a boar. Parasva-Ndtha's cot^ni- 
zance was the hooded snake, (shesha-phani), and that of Mahdvira, the 
last of tlie Jinas, a lion. TheSH two latter, with Risabha-Ndtha, are 
the most widely worshipped, and next to them come Santi (the antelope), 
and Nemi (the blue warer-hly). To what primeval cults these jina8 
may point one can hardly conjecture. 

It is easy to point to the resemblances between Buddhism and 
Jaiiiism. Apart from mere religious phraseology, which tends to be 
the same in every religion, Buddha was often called Jiiia, ' the vic- 
torious': his death was the nirvana: both Buddhists and Jains also 
employ the sivastika or satya as a sacred symbol : the Buddhists also 
have or had a Digambara or order of naked ascetics. Further the 
Jains indicate South Bihar as tho scene of the life and labours of 
nearly all their Tirthankaras, as it was of Buddha's, and Mah;lvira is 
said to have died at Pawa, to which place also Buddha's death is 
assigned. The colossal statues of the Jains also resemble those of the 
Buddhists.* 

The Jain ritual is exceedingly complicated, but it has few features of 
interest. Their places of pdgrimage are five m number, viz., Satrun- 
jaya, Parasnath, in Bihar, Mount Abu, Girnar, and Chandragiri in the 
Himalayas. The oldest Jain remains are probably at Girnar, a hill also 
sacred to Buddhists and Hindus. Tiieir holy seasons appear to be 
peculiar to themselves, but the observance of the rainy season as a 
sacred period of the year is also characteristic of Buddhism.t 

It is not at all easy to say in what points the Jain doctrines diverge 
from ihoso of the Hindus, but apparently the chief differences are that 
tho Jains repudiate the Vedas, and disavow the authority of the 
Brahmane. In other words, they represenc an element of Hinduism 
which never submitted to, or at an early period revolted from, the 
quasi-social supremacy of the Brahman ca^te, and in this ti.ey have 
much in c. mmon with the Buddliists and Sikhs. They also resemble 
the laitei in ha\inga line of spiritual itacbers whom they reverence to 
the more or less complete exclu^ion of the Biahmans.

The J aims as a caste. 



The Jain sutras. 

The Jains hold that their religious books or sidras were 84 in number. 
About 1,500 years ago the whole of India was visited by a famine which 
lasted for full 12 years, and during that period 30 sutras were lost, 
only 45 being preserved. 

No Jain in Bahdwalpur will reveal the name of a siitra because, 
he says, he cannot accurately pronounce it, and mispronunciation of 
its name Avould bring upon him the wrath of the gods. This, however, 
is an excuse, and the truth is that an orthodox J^in is reluctant to tell 
an outsider the names of his sacred books. The sidras are believed to 
be written in Ma^dhi Bhdka (or Bhdsha), the lat>guage presumably of 
the Magadha empire. The Jains believe that Magdhi was spoken by 
the god Indra. 

It is also a tenet of the Jain faith that 8,400,000 (84 lakhs) jiws or 
invisible and visible germs exist in the animal, vegetable, and mineral 
kingdoms and in surg, narq, etc., according to the details given below : —

The Jain caste. 

How far the Jains constitute a true caste it is not possible to say, for 
the community appears to be organized on two distinct but concurrent 
principles, one based on natural descent and so on caste, the other 
sectarian, i.e., on the beliefs of the different sub-sects wi>hin the sect. 
Hence arise cross-divisions which have yet to be elucidated. For ex- 
ample, the NandiSangha'^or order is also called theNandi Amnaya, but 
amnaya means simply kula or fHmily, so that Nandi Amnaya means the 
' generations of Nandi.' Gachha (with which gana is said to be synony- 
mous) is used indifferently for the religious sects or orders, and for the 
natural groups within the caste, there being 84 gachhas or gois, i. e. 
families or races, of the Jains. Whether these are in any way con- 
nected with the spiritual gachhas or not cannot be deBnitely stated.

Ifc is curious, if Mr, Pagan's classification bo correct, ihaL lIio 
Swetambara and Dhnndia isccts intermarry, at least in Bahawalpur 
(where apparently the Din-atnbara do not intermarry with the other 
two sects). The Jain teachititr stroiigly reprohates polygamy and in 
con«equence monogamy is piactised by the 13h{lbra.s generally, e. g., in 
Siiilkot, wliile in Ferozepur they disallow polygamy under pain of 
e.s elusion from the caste. On the other hand, Jainism has little effect

Sitla worship. 

Jaieami, ' followers of one JairuTu,' a sect whose founder was also known as 
Bab^ Kurewala or Bhangewi'ila, which would point to alow origin. 

Jaisak, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

Jaiswaka, a Purbia caste. In the United Provinces a Jaiswdrd, section is 
found in many castes, such as the Cham^r, DL^inak, Kaldl, Kurmi, Teli, 
Bdnia and Rdjput. The name is supposed to be derived from the town 
of Jais in Oudh. The Jaiswara of tlie Punjab cantonments is probably 
a Chamdr, and many of them are grooms or grass-cutters, though a 
few take service as bearers. 

Jaj, (1) a Muhammadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery : 
(2) a Kamboh clan (agricultural) found in Ajuritsar. 

Jajah, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Jajak, the term for a Hindu nai in the Rawalpindi Division, and the Deraj^t, 

according to Sir Denzil Ibbetson. But in Mult/ini the word is said to 
mean ' priest' and to be the same as .Iachak, and in Derd Gh.izi Kh<1n 
the Jajik is a sewe^ of shrouds. The Jdjik is certainly distinct from 
the JhInga. 

Ja.ti, a tribe now ranking as Path^n, and claiming descent from Khugidni, 
son of Kakai, but perhaps of Awd,n stock. The Durrftni Afglidns, 
however, admit that the Khugidni are akin to them. The Jdji lie 
west of the Turis on the western border of Kurram, holding the Irid,b 
valley west of the Pai war pass. One of their sections, the Uji Khel, 
holds Maiddn, a large village in the valley of that name, and another 
section is the Shumu Khel. The Jajis are now at bitter feud with 
the Turis. 

Jajjah (and) Jatfiol, a tribe of Jnts, found in Sialkot. They claim Solar 
Rdjput origin ami say that their ancestor, Jdm, migrated from Mult«4n. 
His two sons Jdj and Jathol founded villages in the Pasrur tah.-sil of 
Sid,lkot. Their rju'ras/* are Posla, their Brahmans Badhar and their 
ndis Khokhar by got. According to the Customary Law of Sidlkof 
the Jajjah is distinct from the Jathaul. 

Jajohan, a Jilt or Rajput clan (agricultural) found in Multd,n. 

Jakhar. — A tribe of Deswdli Jdts, claiming Rdjput (Chauhdn or Udhf ) descent. 
Jdku, their epouyra, migrated from Bikaner to Jhajjnr in Rohtak.

tbe promised reward. In sbamo lie left his native land and settled in 
Bikdner. The legend clearly points to the loss of military status 
by the Jdkhars. Of the same stock are the Sdngwd>n, Pirn, and Kddid,n 
Jilts. The Jiikhar are almost confined to Gurgdon and the adjoining 
Jhajjar tahsil of Hohtak. They also own a lar^e village in H^nsi. 

Jakhar, a Muhannnadan Jd^ or Rdjput clan (agricultural) 'found ia 
Montgomery, where they appear also as a clan of the Bhatti E-^jputs. 

Jakho, a Dogar clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

Jalabke, a sept of Kharrals, which like the Piroke is of supposed Chuhr^ 
descent. Both are hence called Cliuhrere. The legend goes that Sd,ndal 
the famous Chuhrd. dacoit who gave hia name to the Sandal B4r, 
demanded a Kharral bride as his fee for allowing them to graze in that 
tract. But the Kharrals blew up Sdndal and his folio wera and took 
the Chuhril women as their booty. 

JalaiR, ' a well-known Mughal tribe/ according to Raverty. Not apparently 
represented among the modern Mughals in the Punjab. 

Jalalani, a clan of the Bozdd,r Baloch. 

Jalali, one of the regular Muhammadan orders, founded by Sayyid Jaldl- 
ud-d£n, a pupil of Bahdwal Haqq, the Solirwardi saint of Mult:^n, and a 
native of Bukhara whose shrine is at Uch in Bahawalpur. This teacher 
was himself a strict follower of the Law, but his followers, who call 
thenifcelves JaMlis, are in many ways backsliders. They pay little 
attention to prayer. A candidate for admission to the order shaves 
completely his head, face, and body, burns his clothes and is branded 
on his right shoulder. 

Jalap, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur and in Jhelum. In the latter 
District they were classed by Thomson with tlie LiUas and Phaphras as 
a " semi-Jat tribe," while Brandreth referred to them as being, like the 
Khokhars, a "gwasi-Rd,jput tribe," who helped to oust theJanjuas from 
the Pind Dadan Kh^n plain- They are the predominant tribe in the 
" Jdlap ildqii," the rich well tract between the river and the hills east 
of Pind Dadan Klidn, and in position and influence are one of the principal 
tribes of that tahsil, though their numbers at e small and they actually 
own little more than 25 square miles of land : this is their only seat in 
Jhelum, and they are not known tj hold land in any other district, except 
to some small extent on the opposite side of the river. 

They say that they were originally Khokhar Rajputs, who took the 
name of their eponym, Jdlap, who became a famous Pir, and was 
buiied at Rdmdidni in the tSh^hpur district, where they then dwelt, and 
where they still go to do reverence at his tomb : they moved to their 
present location in tlie time of Sidharan, who was several generations 
in descent from Jdlap, Another account states that in the time of the 
emperor Shd,h Jahan they were established on the banks of the 
Cheiiiib, when one of their chiefs was asked by ShAh Jah^n to give him 
a daughter in marriage, as other Rdjputs had done : the Jdlap agreed, 
but the brotherhood disapproved of his action, and when he came home 
to fetch his daughter, set upon him and killed him. Shdh Jahdn sent an 
army to punish them, and being driven from their homes they crossed the

Jhelum, and after many fights with the Janjuas established themselves 
where they aro now found. A third version, {^iven by the d'.4ractor8 of 
the tribe, is tliat in the time of tlio Janjua lUjils of Namiana, a fisher- 
man was casting his net in the river, which was then close nnder the 
hills, and drew out a box soiitainint; a smdll boy : the child was taken 
to the Rdja. who called him Jalap, because he was found in a net (jdl), 
and made over to him as his inheritance the lands along the i-iver: 
according to this account the Jalaps are really Machhis. 

These fables throw little light on their real origin. 'I'neir nein-hboura 
do not admit their claim to bo considered Rajputs ; and in social standint^ 
they stand much belovv the triljes locally supposed to bo of hajimt dc> 
BCent, though on the other hand they rank considerably above the Jats. 
There is no striking difference between them and the burrouniiin"- tribes 
either in physique, appearance or manners : as agriculturists they are 
fair : of martial spirit they have shown but little in recent times, and 
very few of them are in the army, which may be as they say, because 
they mostly ha^'e large holdings, and can well afford to live at liome ; 
and it is certain that without fighting qualities they could not have 
est^'blif-hed and maintained themselves in the most"valuable tract in the 
District, against the Janjuas and others: there is no bar to their enlistment 
and there are some signs that tliey may in future betake themselves to 
military service more freely than in the past. Their custonis are those 
of the tract generally, but they maintain relations with Brahmans as 
parohits : and various common Hindu customs are observed by them at 
marriages. Their marriages are mr stly inter se ; but they take "iris 
from the Khi wa, Kallas andBharat, to whom they do not however give 
their daughters: in marriages with the Janjuas and Khokhars on the 
contrary they give daughters but do not receive them. Widow remar- 
riage is very rare amongst them. 

Jalapke, a Kharral clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery ; doubtless the 
same as the Jalabke. 

Jali, a tribe of Jats, found in Jind. Kalu, their ja^/ienf, has a ma^/i at 
Lahaward in Pati^la. They offer him IJ man of sweet cakes {purds) 
at weddings, and these are taken by a Brahman. 

Jallad^ fr. the Ar&h, jild, 'skin'; a flogger or executioner. It was applied 
to the Kanjars in Ambtlla who were employed as executioners at the 
Delhi court, and in the south-west Punjab is a common term for a 
sweeper (see Chijhra). Cf. the derivation oJ KurtanA; 'whipper.' 

Jaloke, a Kharral clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Jalozai, a tribe of doubtful origin, affiliated to the Turi brfinch of the 
Khattak Pathdns. 

Jalwanf, a small Pathan tribe lying, with the Harip^l, to the south of the 
Shirani. 

Jam, a Sindhi title, meaning chief or headman. When borne by the head" 
men of a Punjab tribe it usually points to a Sindhi origin, i. e., to its 
migration from Sindh or the valley of the Indus. In former times 
Sindh denoted that river valley as far north as the modern Mianwalf.

Jamea, a Jat tribe, of notably fine physique, found in Dera Ghdzi Khdn 
district. Probably aboriginal or immigrants from the eastward. 

Jamun, a Muhammadan Jd^ clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Jamwal, a Hindu Rajput clan (auricnltural) found in Montgomery : and also 
in Siiilko^ where two accounts of their origin are current. According 
to their mirdsis they are of Solar Rdjput descent, and their ancestor 
Agnigar migrated from Ajmlhia to the Rechna Do^b. His son Jammu 
defeated one Ra]a Chanda Rihds and founded the town of Jammu, 
whence their name, Jamwal. One of the chiefs, however, by name 
Milhan Miiihas, took to agriculture and founded the Manhas tribe. 
The other account is that Bhara Datt, migrating from Ajudhia to 
Kashmir, returned and settled at the place where Mankot now stands. 
His descendant Jammu founded an independent state of that name, 
and fourth in descent from him reigned Jogrd,]^ circa 474 Sambat. 
From him descended the Deo dynasty of Sidlkot, whose pedigree ia thus

eastern Salt Ilangc, their head-quarters, in the south-west Punjab 
iucluding Bahdwalpur,* in Hoshii'irpur and Amritsar. The Janjua once 
held almost the whole of the Salt Range tract, but were gradually 
dispossessed by the Gakkhars in the north and by the Awilns in tlie 
west, and they now hold only the central and eastern parts of the Range 
as tribal territory, which is exactly what they held at tfie time of 
Bilbar's invasion. They still occupy a social posirion in this tract 
which is second only to that of tlie Gakkhars, and are always addressed 
as Rdjd,. Various origins have been ascribed to the Janjua. 

According to Bdbar the hill of Jud was held by two tribes of common 
descent, the Jud and Janjiihah. The Janjuhah were old enemies of the 
Gakkhars.t Bdbar records that a headman among them receives tho

Another pedigree* makes them descendants of Jaipal who opposed 
Mahmud of Ghazni at Nandana 900 years ago. B^bar certainly de- 
scribes them as rulers, from old times, of the Salt Range hills and of the 
tract between NiMb and Bhera. He also describes Malik Hast, Janjua, 
as hahim of the ih and nlnses in the neighbourhood of the Soh^n. As 
rulers the Jvid and Janjuha ruled according to fixed customs, not 
arbitrarily, realizing a slmh-nikM i2\ rupees) yearly on every head of 
cattle and seven shah-ruhhis on a marriage.t

I SMh Rukh was a son of Timiar nnd succeeded to his father's empire in 140-l-0.'i, A. D. 
The fact that his coins were in use among the Janjua points either to their having been 
tributary to him or to the inclusion of the Salt Range in his dominions. The latter con- 
jclusjon is the more probable. 



The Janjuas. 3b5 

Mr. Thomsou'b account of the tribo in Jhelunij \\\uv\\ follo>\>, ib not 
contradicted on any material point by tlie prcssent day Janjuas : — 

" Al suine uncertain perioil, then, some clans of Rahtor Rijputs, cmi^iating ficni Judlijmr. 
occupied the uplands of the Salt Ivauf;c. The leader of this nioveinenl accurdjug to the 
coninion account, was Raja Wal ; but this chieftain is a lilllc mythical, and any liirge action 
of doubtful origin is apt to be fatheied upon him. 'i'lio Rajputs lirsl se.'.ted themselves at 
Malot in the west Salt Range. This jdace, although picturesque, i& so inacccssjblo and 
unfruitful, that it must have been chosen for safety more than convenience. From here the 
Rajputs extended their supremacy over the uplands of Jhangar and Knhun and the plain 
country near Girjal<h and Darapur. In these regiouK Ihcy were rather .^etlk-is than con- 
querors. They not only ruled, but to a great extent occupied also. It sien.s very doubtful 
wiicther their real territories ever extended much further, but their trr.diiions certainlv 
point tu a former lordshij) over the western upland of VHuhar, and over much of the present 
tahsils of Tallagang and C'hakwal. If Babar's account be read \\\\\\ attention, it will be 
.seen that he represents the Janjiias as confined to the liilJs, and ruling over various subject 
tribes who cultivated the plains. This account serves to explain the utier extirpatirm that 
has befallen the Janjuas in the Vunhnr and elsewhere. If we conceive them as holding 
detached forts in the midst of a foreign jjopidation which giadually grew hostile, then this 
extirpation cin easily be understood. 'J his also serves, to explain how one or two villages 
of peasant Janjuas have escaped, while all the Chiefs and Rajas round about have perisht-d. 
The vague accounts of the people seem to point to some such history as this, and not to any 
great racial or tribal war. 

The Janjcas were long the predominant race in the centre and west of the District. Raja 
Mai is said to have reigned in the days of Mahnnad of Ghazni, and his authority was pro- 
bably more or less recognised from Rawalpindi to the Jhelum. When Mahinud invaded 
India the Janjuas opposed him, were defeated, and fled to the jungles. Mahmud followid 
Iheiu up, and succeeded in capturing Ruja Jlal himself. The Raja was released on condi- 
tion that he and his tribe should embrace Isl^rn. When this conversion took place, the 
jaiiju, or caste-thread was broken, and the neophytes have been called Janjuas ever since.* 

Raja Mai is said to have left five sons. Three of these settled in Rawalpindi or Ilaz^ra. 
Two, Wir and Jodh, remained in Jhelum. They speedily divided their possessions. "Wir took 
the west, and Jodh the eastern share. Choya Saidan Shah was the boundary between them. 
AVir's descendants are now represented by the Janjuas of Malot and the Kahihi iluqa. 
Their chief seat is at Dihval. Jodh's descendants have split into many branches. A general 
supremacy was long exercised by the Sultans of Jlakhiala in Jhangar. .But the chiefs of 
Kusak and B^ghJinwala soon became practically independent, as did also those of Liliir, 
Karangli, and Girjakh, whose descendants are now either eitinct or much decayed. The 
plain ildqa of Darapiir and Chakri seems to have broken oil from the main stock even earlier 
than the others. This passion for separatism is fatal to any large authority. The feuds to 
which it gave rise, joined with an endless Gakkhar war, and the establishment of new and 
strenuous races beyond the mountains brought the .lanjiia dominion to destruction. The 
Dhani country, called Maluki Dhan after the great Raja, and the forts in Tallagang and the 
Vunhir seem to have been all lost not long after the lime of Babar. But in the centre and 
cast Salt Range and round Darapur the Janjua supremacy remained imdisputed until the 
advent of the Sikhs. And the rich >SaIt Klines at Khewra and Makrach must have alwavs 
made this territory important. The Sikhs conquered the whole country piecemeal. Ranjit 
Singh himself besieged and captured Makhiala and Kusak, Most of the influential chiefs 
received jiigirs but were ousted from their old properties. 

The Janj-uas are physically a well-looking race. Their hands and feet in particidar are 
often much smaller and more linely shaped than those of their neighbours. They largely 
engage in miliUiry service, where they prefer the cavalry to the infantry. They arc poor 
farmers, and bad men of business. They are careless of details, and ajit to be passionate 
when opposed. Too often they lix their hopes on impossible objects. As landlords they 
are not exacting with submiissive tenants. They are willing to sacrifice something to retain 
even the poor parodies of feudal respect which time has not destroyed. Their manners are

xtio<-i of the genealogies comes eight or nine generations before Raja iial. it is moreover 
improbable that the general conversion of the Janjiias took place 900 years ago ; it is likely 
enough that Mahrai'id made converts, and that these reverted as soon as his back was turned: 
but (he Junjua village pedigree tables nearly all agree in iutrcducing Muhaniniadan names 
only about 15 generations back, A\hich woidd jjoint to their general conveision about the 
middle of the 15th century. Cracroft however noted that the Janjuas in Kawalpindi etill 
continued to feast Brahmans, etc., at weddings.

often good. They have a largo share of vanity which is generally rather amusing than 
oflensive. Tlioy arc at the same time self-respecting, and not ■without a certain kind of 
pride, and are eminently a people with whom slight interludes of emotional government are 
likely to bo useful." 

In Hosliiarpur tlie Janjuds are fairly numerous to the nortli-east of 
Dasiiya.''^" The Bilials of Badla are said to bo an al or sub-iHvision of 
the Janjua which takes its name from the village of Beata in ta'p'pa 
Kamiihi. Bah means a settlement, and the Janjua villages seem 
often to begin with Bah. The Janjuas in this District say they migrated 
from Hastinapura to Garh Makhuila in Rd,walpindi or Jhelum, and 
thence, to escape Muhammadan oppression to Badla under Rdja 
Sahj lYil, 8th in descent from K^jd Jodh. His son Pahar Singh 
held 132 vilhiges round Badla. They claim to be Kanas of the Dogars, 
and the head of the family is installed t with the common ceremony of the 
tiha under a banian tree at Barnd,r or Bah Ata, though Badla (Bar- or 
Boharwcila) also claims the honour, amidst the assembled Pogars of Mehr 
Bhatoh, a village near Badla, who present a horse and shawl, while the 
Bihdls pay a nazar of Re. 1 or Rs. 2 each. They are said to only give 
daughters to Dadwd,ls, who are 1st grade Rajputs, and to take them from 
Barangwdls, Laddus, and Ghorewrihd,s, who are in the 3rd grade. 

The Badlial is another Janjua sept, deriving its name from Badla, 
the ancient Rajput i^^•a. Badla is now in ruins and its rand's family 
is extinct, but the sept has made one of its members their rand and 
presents nazardna, etc., to him as usual. Still, as he has not been 
installed or made a tilakdliari, his rdndsJiip does not count for much.

These five gots may however intermarry and are, collectively, called 
Jaria, which is also said to be derived from /om and to mean ' twin.' 

* The Pahri of Kuhi is a branch of the Janjiias which has taken to l-areica and so lost

7, 9, 11 or 13 days after his predecessor's death the principal men of the tract are feasted ; 
in the afternoon they assemble at a rock behind the Sultin's house and the family 
Brahman puts the tika on his forehead. The Sultan then appoints a %mxir and four diwdns.

conteinptuously. In the south-west of the Province the Multaui and 
Balochi term for a Jat is Jagdal, and Jat (with the soft t) is used 
to denote a camel-driver, as in Upper Sindli, where jat now means 
a rearer of camels or a shepherd, in opposition to a hnsbandman.

Fragmentary notices of the Jdfs occur in the Muhammadan historian? 
of India, as will be seen from the fallowing excerpts from Elliot's 
History of India.

the frontier of Kirmiln to Mansura as 80 />ar«6a?/^.y, and adds :—

watch over it." E. H. L, I, p. 14,

368 The Jdts in history. 

Ac-cordiog to the author of the Miijiiial-ut-Tawdrikh^ the Jatst and 
Mods were reputed desceudauts of Ham. They both dwelt in SindJ 
and on (the banks of) the Bahar river, and the Jata were sub)eet to 
tlie Meds wliose oppression drove them across the I'ahan river. The 
Jats were, however, accustomed to the use of boats and were thus able 
to cross the river and raid the Meds, who were owners of sheep. 
Eventually the Jats reduced the Med power and ravaged their country. 
A J at chief, however, induced both tribes to lay aside their differences 
and send a deputation of chiefs to wait on King Dajushan (Dur- 
yodhaua), son of Dahrdt (Dhritarashtra), and beg him to nomin- 
ate a king, whom both tribes would obey. Accordingly the emperor 
Dajushan appointed Dassal (Duhsala), his sister, and wife oi" the 
powerful king Jandrat (Jayadratha), to rule over the Jats and Mods'. As 
the country possessed no Brahmans, she wrote to her bixither for 
aid, and he sent her 30,000 from H.industd,n. Her capital was Askaland. 
A small portion of the country she made over to the Jats under their 
chief, Judrat.§ 

Chach, the Brahman usurper|| of Sind, humiliated the Jats and 
Lohanas. He compelled them to agree to carry only sham swords : 
to wear no under-garments of shawl, velvet or silk, and only silken 
outer- garment 8, provided they were red or black in colour: to put no 
saddles on their horses : to keep their heads and feet uncovered : to 
take their dogs with them when they went out: to furnish guides and 
spies and carry firewood for the royal kitchen.^ Of the Loh^na, ^. e. 
Lakha and Samma, who were apparently Jats, it is said that the same 
rules were applied to them and that they knew no distinction of great 
and small. *^ Muhammad bin Qdsim maintained these regulations, 
declaring that the Jats resembled the savages of Persia and the moun- 
tains. He also fixed their tribute.t+

tered the Arab service, garrisoned Sagara and the island of Bait,t J ^^

The Jats, like the Baloch, the Sammas and the Sodhas, revolted 
against Umar,§§ but they were soon reduced to submission, ante 1300 
A. D. 

In 834 A. D., and again in 835 Ajff bin Isa was sent against the 
Jats, whose chief was Muhammad bin 'lJsmaii|| || and commander Samlu. 
Ajif defeated them in a seven months' campaign, and took 27,000 of 
them, including women and children with 12,000 fighting men to

Baghddxl, whence they were transported to the northern frontier and 
Boon perished, exterminated in a Byzantine raid. The seats of these 
•Tats lay on the roads of Hajar, which they had seized. 

Amran, the Barmecide governor of the Indian frontier, marched to 
Kikiln"^' against tlie Jats wliom ho dofeatod and subjugated. There he 
founded Al-Baiza, the ' white city ', wliioh he garrisoned, and thonco 
proceeded to Mnltan and Kandiihil. The latter city stood on a hill and 
was hold hy Muliammad, son of Khalil, whom Amriln slew. Elo then 
made war on the Mods, but sunnnonod the Jats to Alrur, where lie 
sealed their hands, took fioia them the Jizya or poll-tax and ordered 
that every man of them should biincr wjtli him a dog when he waited nn 
him. He then again att^acked the Meds, liaving with him the chief 
men of the Jats.t Amr.in was appointed in 836 A. D. to be governor 
of Sindh. 

The Tuhfat-n'l-Kiram appears to assign to the Jats and Bilochcs 
the same descent, from Mnhamraad, son of Hd,run, governor of Makran, 
who was himself descended from the Amir Hamza, an Arab^ by a 
fairy, t 

The Jjits of Jud, which we must take to mean the Salt Range, 
were, according to the later Muhammadan historians, the object of 
Mahmud's 17th and last expedition into India in 1026 A. D. It 
is however hardly possible that Mahmud conducted a naval campaign 
in or near the Salt Hange, and the expedition probably never took 
place. It is moreover exceedingly donbtfnl whether the Salt Range 
was then occupied by Jats at all.§ 

Jats, under Tilak, hunted down Ahmad, the rebel governor of 
Mult:4n, in 1034 A. D., until he perished on the Mihran of Sind. For 
this they received 100,000 dirhamsnsH reward. The Jats were still 
Hindus.ll 

After the defeat of Rai Pithaura in 1192, and the capture of 
Delhi by Muhammad of Ghor, Jatwan raised the standard of national 
resistance to Muliammadan aggression at Hansi, but was defeated 
on the borders of the Bagar by Qutb-ud-din Ibak who then took 
Hjlnsi. It is apparently not certain that Jatwan was a Jat loader. 
Firishta says Jatwan was a dependent of the Rdi of Nahrwald in 
Guzerat.U 

In November 1398 Timur marched through the jungle fi'om Ahruni 
in Karndl to Tohana, throjigh a tract wliich he found inhabited by 
Jats, Musulnians only in name, and without equals in theft and high- 
way robbery: they plundered caravans on the road and were a 
terror to Mnsulmdns and travellers. On Timiir's approach the Jats 
had abandoned the villnge (Tohana) and tied to their sugarcane 
fields, valleys, and jungles, but Timur pursued them, apparently after

demon-like Jats to the sword.^ 

About 1530 the Sultitu Muhammad ibn Tughliq had to suppress the 
Binihas, ]\landahars, Jats, Bhat(ti)s, and Manhis (Minas), who had 
formed mandals round Sundm and Sdmdaa, withheld tribute and 
plundered the roads.t 

"In the country between Nilab and Bhera, " wrote B^bar, "but 
distinct from the tribes of Jud and Janjuhah, and adjacent to the 
Kashnifr hills are the Jats, Gujars, and many others of similar tribes, 
who build villages, and settle on every hillock and iu every valley. 
Their hdhivi was of the Gakkhar race, and their government resembled 
that of the Jud and Janjuhah.' 'J 

" Every time," adds Babar, ''that I have entered Hindustan, the Jats 
and Gujars have regularly poured down in prodigious numbers from 
their hills and wilds, in order to carry off oxen and buffaloes." They 
had committed great depredations, and their districts now yielded 
little revenue. After the ^est of the country had been subdued these 
tribes began their old practices again, and plundered the Turki 
parrison on its way from Sidlkot to Babar's camp. B^bar had two 
or three of the offenders cut in pieces.§ Like the Bhuki^l and other 
tribes the Jats were dependents of the Gakkhars.|l Fath Kli^n, Jat of 
Kot Kapura^ devastated the whole Lakhi Jangal and kept the high 
roads from Lahore to Delhi in a ferment in Sher Shah's time. 

The Tdrikh-i'Tdhiri describes the tribes of the Baloch and Nahmrui 
(? Brahui), of the Jokiya*"^ and Jat, as settled on the hills adjoining 
the Lakki mountain, which extend to Kich and Makran^tt in the time 
of Akbar. The Muntahhab-u'l-Luhdh describes the Sikhs as principally 
Jats and Khatris.Jt 

The Jdts of the south-east Punjab formed politically a part of the 
Bhartpur principality during the decay of the Mughal empire of 
Delhi. Occasionally a single village would plunder an imperial 
baggage-train, §§ bub the tribes, as a whole, looked to Bhartpur as 
their capital. The Nawd,b Safdar Jang employed Suraj Mai, and he 
obtained the whole of the Mewd,t, up to the neighbourhood of Delhi, 
besides the province of Agra.

The following account of the Juts in the Punjab is largely a re- 
production of the late Sir Densoil Ibbetsun^s account of them in tho 
Punjab Census Report, 1883.* He profaced his account by observinr^ 
that the Vine separating Jdt,--, Rajputs and certain other castes (tribes) 
is almost impossible of defiuitiun.t More especially is this true of 
the whole of the Western Punjab, where the term for one of 'gentle' 
birth is sahu. especially in the Salt Hange, and where the land-<jwuing 
and cultivating classes arc organised on a tribal basis, so that stress is 
always laid on a man's tribo or clan and not on his status or ' caste.' As 
WG go further east the people begin to use the caste terms, Rajput and 
Jdt, more freely, but in the vaguest possible way, so that a Muhammadau 
Jat tribe in tiujninwala or Gujiat will api)ear now as Rajput and a 
decudo later as Jat, or vice versa, or half the tribe will return itself 
as Hajput and tho other half as Jat, as caprice dictates. Along the 
Jammu border, and beyond it into Gurda^^pur, the Rdjputs and Jats 
are well defined, the former being coniined to tho hills, the latter to 
the plains, as Sir Luuis Dane has jiointed out,| so rigidly that one is 
almost tempted to suspect that there is something in the physical 
nature of the plains which militates against the formation of an 
aristocracy. Within tho hills the Ra.jpdts have their own social 
gradations. In the plains the Jats al^o are tending to devclope social 
distinctions which will be noticed later on. In the Central Punjab 
tho Jc4t is fairly well deBned as a caste, though he is not absolutely 
endogamous^ as marriages with wunn^n of inferior ca^ti^s may be 
deprecated but are not invahd. Kven in the eastern districts such 
marriages are tolerated, but in the true Jat. c;ountry which centres 
round Rohtak they are probably much rarer than in karmil, Ambala 
or tho central districts, liroadly speaking, the JAt is a iVIusulmciu 
in the Western Districts, a Sikh in the Centre, and a Hindu in the 
South-East. but there are many exceptiuiis to this rule. In the 
Sikh Districts it is a brother's duty, as well as his privilege, to espouse

remarriage differeutiates the Hindu Jat from the Rajput, but it is 
not universal even among the Jats, for in Gurgaon some J^t families 
disallow it and others which allow it do not permit it with the 
husband's relatiois.''^ In other words, as we go eastwards orthodox 
Brahmiiiical ideas come into play. 

The origins of the Jdt. 
Perhaps no question connected with the ethnology of the Punjab 
peoples lias been so much discussed as the origin of the so-called Jdt 
' race/ It is not intended here to reproduce any of the arguments adduced. 
They will be found in detail in the Archxological Survey Reimrts, II, 
pp. 51 to (31 ; in Tod's Rajasthdn, 1, pp. 52 to 75 and 96 to 101 (Madras 
Iveprint, 1^80} ; in Elpliinstone's History of India, pp. 250 to 253 ; and 
in Elliot's Eaces of the N.-W. P., I, pp. 130 to 137. Suffice it to say that 
both Sir Alexander Cunningham and Colonel Tod agreed in considering 
the Jats to be of Indo-Scythian stock. The formfr identified them with 
the Zantlii of Strabo and the Jatii of Pliny and Ptolemy; and held that 
they probably entered the Punjab from their home on the Oxus very 
sliortly after the Meds or Mands, who al?o were In do- Scythians, and 
Avho moved into the Punjab about a century before Christ, The Jats 
eeem to have first occupied the Indus valley as far down as Sindb, 
whither the Meds followed them about the beginning of the present 
era. But before the earliest Muhammadau invasion the J^ts had 
spread into the Punjab Proper, where they were firmly estabHshed in 
the beginnir.g of the 1 1th century. By the time of Bdbar the Jats 
of the Salt Range had been subdued by the Gakkhars, Awans, and 
Janjuas, while as early as the 7th century the Jdts and Meds of 
Sindh were ruled by a Brahman dynasty. Tod classed the Jats as one 
of the great Bdjput tribes, and extended his identification with the 
GetcC to both races ; but here Cunningham differed from him, holding 
the Rajputs to belong to the original Aryan stock, and the Jats to a 
later wave of immigrants from the north-west, probably of Scythian 
race. 

'It may be' continued Sir Denzil IbbetsoUj 'that the original Rdjput 
and the original Jat entered India at different periods in its history, 
though to my mind the term Edjput is an occupational rather than 
an ethnological expression. But if they do originally represent two 
separate waves of immigration, it is at least exceedingly probable^ 
both from their almost identical physique and facial character and 
from the close commnnion which has always existed between them, 
that they belong to one and the same ethnic stock; while, whether 
this be so or not, it is almost certain that they have been for many 
centuries and still are so intermingled and so blended into one people, 
that it is practically impossible to distinguish them as separate wholes. 
It is indeed more than probable that the process of fusion has not 
ended here, and that the people who thus in the main resulted from 
the blending of the Jat and the Rajput, if these two ever were distinct, 
is by no means free from foreign elements. We have seen how the 
Pathan people have assimilated Sayyids, Turks and Moghals, and how

Jdt origins. 803 

ifc was sufficient for a Jat tribe to retain its political independence and 
orffanisation in order to be admitted into tlic Balocih nation ; we know 
bow a character for sanctity and social exclu.sivrttiess combined will 
in a few generations make a Quresh or a Sayjid; nnd it is almost certain 
that the joint Jat-Rajjiut stock contains not a few tribes of aboriginal 
descent, tliongh it is probably in the main Aryo-Scythian, it' Scythian 
be not Aryan. Tlic Man, Her, and Blinllar JAts are known as re?// or 
original Jats because they claim no Hajpnt ancestry, but are suppo!>ed 
to be descended from the hair (jat) ot the aboriginal god Siva ; 
the Jdts of the south-eastern districts divide themselves into two 
sections, Shivgotri or of the family of Siva,* and Kdsabgotri who 
claim connection with the Rajputs; and the names of the nncestor liar 
of the Shivgotris and of liis son ]3arbara, are the very words which 
the ancient Brahmans give ns as the marks of the Barbarian aborigine?. 
Many of the Jat tribes of the Punjab have customs which apparently 
point to non-Aryan origin, and a rich and almost virgin field for 
investigation is here open to the ethnologist. 

In other words, the Shivgotri Jits of the south-east like the ^lan, 
Her and Bhullar, are unassuming tribes which do not lay claim 
to descent from a once dominant or ruling clan, whereas nearly all 
the other Jat clans arrogate to themselves Rdjput ancestry, meaning 
thereby that once upon a time they, or some representatives of the 
clan, were sovereign or semi-independent chieftains acknowledging 
no rdjd but their own head.t 

* Wc may regard Shiva here as the earth-goil and the Shiv>^otri as autochthones. In 
ITiss4r, where the.v are few in numbers, they say that their forefather was created from tlie 
matted hair cf Shiva, who consequently was named Jat Budhra. Regarding thoir origin 
there is no historical account. But tradition tells that one of the clan, named Barh, became ^ , 
master of a large portion of Bikiiner ; where, at first he created a village which he called • . /^ 
after his name ; and thereafter went and resided at Jhansal, where his descendants live to 
this day, and which i'^d'yc belongs to them. lie had 12 sons: — Punii. Dhania, Chachnk, \,^_ ■ 
Bull, Burhura, Snhilhun, Chirin, Chandia, Khdk, Duinij, Lifer, and Kakkar. From the.se ^ ' 

sprang 12 sub-divisions. (Khok is also a Gil )/ii('u'/i.. Piniia was ancestor cf the Punnii). ^ 
The doscendants of the first were most in number, and had the largest possessions. Tliey > 
owned the coimtry round Jhansal which was called the Punia ildq<i and which is mentioned ' ' ^^ ' 
in the Ain-i-Akbari. Marriages among members of this clan cannot, according to their ^ 

custom, be formed amongst themselves ; i. c, they must intermarry with the Kiisabgotri.H. / 

The latter are in reality degenerate Rijputs, and call themselves Kasabgotris after Kitsab, 
son of Brahma. 
+ Mr. II. Davidson in the following passage cle■^rly went too far : — 

" It is not gonerally known that the .T^t race i?? entirely of Rajput origin. A Rajput 
marrying the widow cf a deceased brother loses caste as a Rajput; the ancestors of all 
the .fat families were thus Rujputs, who had taken to wife the widows of their deceased 
brethren, who had died without male heirs. The Phiilkisin family, if questioned as to 
their R4jput descent, being now to all intents and purposes Jiits. would state this to have 
been the manner of the transition. I myself have the fact from one of the most intelligent 
members of the family. The headmen of more than one Jiifc village of different </<>/.<, or 
clans, have likewise given me the same information, and I am convinced of its general 
truth. Tlie sub-division of (or) po's among the .Iiits is endless, and I have been at some 
pains to trace the circumstance, which constitutes the origin of each got. The result is 
entirely confirmatory of the above account of the general origin of the race. The Rnjput 
ancestor, who cea?ed to bo a Rajput, furnishes llie nnme of the <iof, not usually directly 
from his own name, but from some surname he had acquired, as the ' toothless ' ' the fair ' 
or from circumstance attending his family, or the l>irth of his sons A very powerful got 
is styled ' the hay-stack ' from the fact of his wife having been suddenlv confined near 
one; in some cases the name of the village he or his sens founded gave the name of the 
yoMvhich derives its ancestry frcim him. One got never intermarries within itself, one 
yof marrying with another jof. Much has been written on the peculiar meaning of the 



Rajjmts a7id Jdts, 

Are the Jdts and Rajputs distinct ? 

' But ' continued Sir Denzil, whether Jdts and Rajputs were or were 
not originally distinct, and whatever aboriginal elements may have 
been affiliated to their society, I think that the two now form a 
common stock, the distinction between Jat and Riijput being social 
I rather than ethnic, I believe that those families of that common stock 
whom the tide of fortune has raised to political importance have 
become IMjjints almost by mere virtue of their rise : and that their 
descendants have retained tlie title and its privileges on the toudition, 
strictly enforced, of observing the rules by which the higher are 
distinguished froin the lower castes in the Hindu scale of precedence; 
of preserving their purity of blood by refusing to mai-ry with families 
of inferior social rank, of rigidly abstaining from widow maTriage, 
and of refraining from degrading occupations. Those w^ho transgressed 
these rules have fallen fiom their high position and ceased to be 
IMjputs ; while such families as, attaining a dominant position in their 
territory, began to affect social exclusiveuess and to observe the rules 
have become not only Raj^s, but also Rdjputs or " sons of Rdj^a." 
For the last seven centuries the process of elevation at least has 
been almost at a standstill. Under the Delhi emperors king-making 
was practically impossible. Under the Sikhs the Hfi,jput was over- 
shadowed by the J.4t, who resented his assumption of superiority and 
his refusal to join him on equal terms in the ranks of the Khi1,lsa, 
deliberately persecuted him wherever and whenever he had the power, 
and preferred his title of Jdt Sikh to that of the proudest Rajput. 
On the frontier the dominance of Pathdns and Baloches and the 
general prevalence of Muhammadan feelings and ideas placed recent 
Indian origin at a discount, and led the leading families who belonged 
to neither of these two races to claim connection, not with the 
Kshatriyas of the Sanskrit classes, but with the Mughal conquerors 
of India or the Qureshi cousins of the Prophet; insomuch that even 
admittedly Ra]put tribes of famous ancestry, such as the Khokhar 
have begun to follow the example. But in the hills, where Rajput 
dynasties with genealogies perhaps more ancient and unbroken than can 
be shown by any other royal families in the world retained their 
independence till yesterday, and where many of them still enjoy as 
great social authority as ever, the twin processes of degradation from 
and elevation to Rd-jput rank are still to be seen in operation. The 
Rdja is there the fountain not only of honour but also of caste, which 
is the same thing in India.' And Sir James Lyall wrote : — 

'_' Till lately the limits of castes do not seem to have been so immutably fixed in the hills 
as in the plains. The Raja was the fountain of honour, and could do much as he liked. 
I have heard old men quote instances within their memory in which a Raj 4 promoted a 



word zami'nddr, in different parts of India. Here the use of the word is very peculiar. 
Those, generally, who derive their livelihood directly from the soil, are not called saminddrs 
but l-asdns.^ On approaching a village, and asking what people live in it, if any other raco 
but Jats live in it the name of the race will be given in reply. Rut if the population are 
.Tats, the reply will be ' zaminddrs live tiiere ' ~ zaminddr log haxte ; in fact the word 
zaminddv 13 here only applied to the .Tats." This last remark, Sir Donald McLeod noted, 
applied equally almost throughout the Punjab, even where the Jats have been converted 
to IsUm. Ludhiana Sett. Rep., 1859, pp. 28-29. The ' hay- stack' ^of is said to be the 
Garewal. 



Jdts as degraded Rajputs, 365 

Ghirth to be a Rslthi, and a Thiitur to be a R&jput, for service done or money given ; and 
at the present day the power of admitting back into caste fellowship persons put imder a 
han for some grave act of defilement, is a source of income to the )n<jlrddi- R'ljas. I believe 
that Mr. Campbell, afterwards LieulcnantCJovernor of Hinigal, has asserted that there is no 
such thing as a distinct Rajpul slock ; that in forinor liinos before caste distinctions ha.I 
become crystallized, any Iribe or family wiiosc unoostor or head rose to royal rank l)t'carao 
in time Rajput. This is coitaiuly tho conclusion to wliicli many facts point with regard lo 
the Rijput families of this district, r/r., Kotlehr and Bangahal. are said to be Brahmans 
by original slock. Mr. Barnes says tliat in Kangra the sou of a Rajput by a low-caste 
woman takes place as a lUthi : in Saraj and other places in the interior of the hills I liavn 
met families calling themselves R;ji)uts, and growing into general acceptance as Rajputs, in 
their own country at least, wlioso only claim to the title was that their grandfather was 
the offspring of a Kauctni by a foreign Brahm.-u. On the border line in the Himalayas, 
hctwcen Tibet and India proper, any one can observe caste growing before his eyes ; the 
ucblo is changing into a Riij put, the priest into a Brahman, the peasant into a Jat, and no 
on down to the bottom of the .scale. The same process was, I believe, more or less in force 
iu Kangra Proper down to a period not very remote from to-day.' 

A very similar process has been going on among the Jcits. The 
Golia J{\U were certainly by origin Brahmans and the Langrijll were 
Chilran.s. And in the ])lain« countless traditions say that the son of 
a Rftjpiit by a Jat, (xiijar, llor or other wife of low degree boranio 
Jilts. Hnt in tlie plains, as in the hills, a llajpnt can lose his status 
and .sink in the social scale by allowing the practis(^ of kareva, and 
niunerons Jat traditions point to the adoption of tliat custom as 
having degraded a blne-blooded Rajput family to J;it or yeoman 
status. As Sir Denzil Ibbetson wrote : — 

* The reverse process of degradation from Rajput to lower rank is too 
common to require proof of its oxi.stence, which will be fonnd if needed 
together with further instances of elevation, in the section which treats 
of the Rajputs and kindred castes. In the eastern di.sfcricts, where 
Biahmanisni is stronger than in any other part of the Punjab, and 
Delhi too near to allow of families rising to political independence, it; 
is ]irobable that no elevation to tlie rank of Raiput has taken place 
within recent time.^. But many R^ijput families have ceased to be 
Rajputs. Setting aside the general tradition of the Punjab Jats to the 
effect tiiat their ancestors were Hajputs who married Jats or began to 
practise widow-marriage, we have the Gaurwa Rajputs of Gurgaon and 
Delhi, who have indeed retained the title of Rtii])ut because the caste 
feeling is too strong in those parts a»id the change in their customs too 
recent for it yet to have died out, but who have, for all pui-poses of 
equality, coinmunion, or intermarriage, ceased to be Rajputs since they 
took to the practice of kareica ; we have the Sahnsars of Hoshiilrpur 
who were Ri1,jputs within the last two or three generations, but have 
ceased to be so l)ecause they gi-ow vegetables like the Arain ; in Karnal 
we have Hajputs who within the living generation have ceased to be 
R-'ijputs and become Shaikhs, because poverty and loss of land forced 
them to weaving as an occupation ; while the Delhi Chauhan, within the 
,«hadow of the city where their anoestors once ruled and lei the Indian 
armies in their last struggle with the Musalm^n invaders, have lost 
their caste by yielding to the temptations of karewa. In the Sikh 
tract, as t have said, the Jdt is content to be a Jat, and has never since 
the rise of Sikh power wished to be any tiling else. In the Western 
Plains the freedom of marriage allowed by Islam has superseded 
caste i-estrictions, and social rank is measured by tlie tribe rather than 
by the larger unit of caste. But even there, families who were a few 



366 The Jdfs fitatuf}. 

generations ago reputed Jdts have now risen by social exclusiveness to 
be recognised as R.^jputs^ and farailieg who were lately known as 
Riijpats havo sunk till they are now classed with Jats ; while the great 
rnlinsr tribes, the Sial, the Gondal, the Tiwdna are commonly spoken of 
as IJaipnts, and their smaller brethren as Jtits. The same tribe even is 
Rajput in ouo district and J;lt in another^ according to its position 
among the local tribes. In the Salt Range the dominant tribes, the 
Janjua, Manhris and the like, are lUjputs when ihey are not Mughals 
»v Arabs; while all asricultural tribes of Indian origin who cannot 
oatabliah tlicir title to Rajput rank are Jdts. Finally, on the frontier 
the Pathcin and Baloch have overshadowed Jat and Rajput alike; and 
Bhatti, Punw^ir, Tiinwar, all the proudest tribes of Rajputilna, are 
included in the name and have sunk to the level of Jd.t, for there can 
be no Rdjputs where there are no Rdjds or traditions of Rajds. I know 
that the vieAvs herein set forth will be held heretical and profane by 
many, and that they ought to be supported by a greater wealth of 
instance than I have produced in the following j^ages. Bat I have no 
time to marshal my facts ; I have indeed no time to record more than 
a small proportion of them ; and all I can now attempt is to state the 
conclusion (o which my enquiries have led me, and to hope to deal with 
the subject in more detail on some future occasion.' 

These conclusions are confirmed by facts observed with regard to 
other so-called castes, such as the Gaddis, Gujars, Kanets, Meos, and 
others too numerous t^ mention. The term J^ may now connote a 
caste in the ordinary acceptance of the term, but whatever its deriva- 
tion may be, it came to signify, in contradistinction to R<4jput, a 
yeoman cultivator, usually owner of land, and in modern parlance J^t- 
zamindiir is the usual description of himself which a Jt4t will give. 
As Sir Deuzil Ibbetson said : — 

The position of the Jdt in the Punjab. 
' The Jiit is in every respect the most important of the Punjab 
peoples. In point of numbers he surpasses the Rd,jput, who comes next 
to him, in the proportion of nearly three to one. Politically he ruled 
the Punjab till the Kh^ilsa yielded to our arms. Ethnologically he is 
the peculiar and most prominent product of the plains of the five rivers. 
And from an economical and administrative point of view he is the 
husbandman, the peasant, the revenue-payer par excellence of the 
Province. His manners do not bear the impress of generations of wild 
freedom which marks the races of our f ontier mountains. But he is 
more honest, more industrious, more eturdy, and no less manly than 
they. Sturdy independence indeed and patient vigorous labour are his 
strono-est characteristics. The Jdt is of all the Punjab races the most 
impatient of tribal or communal control, and the one which asserts the 
freedom of the individual most stronijly. In tracts where, as in 
Rohtak, the Jdt tribes have the field to themselves, and are compelled, 
in default of rival castes as enemies, to fall back upon each other for 
somebody to quarrel with, the tribal ties are strong. But as a rule a 
Jdt is a man who does what seems right in his own eyes and sometimes 
what seems wrong also, and will not be said nay by any man. I do not 
mean however that he is turbulent : as a rule he is very far from being 
so. He is independent and he is self-willed; but he ig reasonable, 



Jd^ characteristics. 867 

peaceably inclined if left alone, and not difficult to njanage. Ho is 
usually content to cultivate his fields and pay his revenue m peace and 
({uietness if people will let him do so; though when he does go w von «• 
he "takes to anything from gambling to murder, with perhaps a 
preference for stealing other peopVs wives and cattle." As usual the 
proverbial wisdom of the villages describes him very fairly, thou<>h 
perhaps somewhat too severely : " The soil, fodder, clothes, hemp, 
grass fibre, and silk, those six are best beaten ; and the seventh is thu 
Jat. " "A Jat, a Bhat, a caterpillar, and a widow woman j these four 
are best hungry. If they eat their fill they do harm." "The J&i, 
like a wound, is better when bound.'' In agriculture the J^t is pre- 
eminent. The market-gardening castes, the Aruin, the Mali, the Saini, 
are perhaps more skilful cultivators on a t-mall scale ; but they cannot 
rival tbe Jilt as landowuers and yeoman cultivators. The Jat calls 
himself zamlndur or "husbandman" as often as J^t, and his women and 
children alike work with him in the fields : " The Ja^'s baby has a 
plough handle for a plaything." " The Jiit stcod on his corn heap 
and said to the king's elephant-drivers — ' Will you sell those littlo 
donkeys ? " Socially, the Jcit occupies a position which is shared by 
the Kor, the Gujar, aud the Aliir, all four eating and smokijig together. 
He is of course far below the RjJjput, from tlie simple fact that he 
practises widow-marriage. The Jat fatlier is made to say, in the 
rhyming proverbs of the country side — ' Come my daughter and be 
married j if this husband dies there are plenty more.' But among the 
widow-marrying castes he stands first. The Bania with his sacred 
thread, his strict Hinduism, and his twice-born standing, looks down on 
the Jat as a Sudra. But the Jat looks down upon the Bania as a 
cowardly spiritless money-grubber, and society in general agrees with 
the Jat. The Khatri, who is far superior to the Bania iu manliness and 
vigour, probably takes precedence of the Jat. But among the races or 
tribes of purely Hindu origin, 1 think that the Jat stands next after 
the Brahman, the Rajput, and the Khatri. 

There are, lio-wever, Jdts and Jilts. I shall here do nothing more 
than briefly indicate the broad distinctions. The Jdt of the Sikh 
tracts is of course the typical Jat of the Punjab, and he it is whom 
I have described above. The Jat of the south-easteiii districts differs 
little from him save iu religion ; though on the Bik^ner border the puny 
Biigri Jat, immigrant from his rainless ])rairies where he has been 
lield in bondage for centuries, and ignorant of cultivation save in its 
rudest form, contrasts strongly with the stalwart and independent 
husbandman of the Malwa. On the Jjower Indus the word Jt'it is 
applied generically to a congeries of tribe>», Jats i»roper, Rajputs, lower 
castes, and mongrels, wlio have no points in common save their 
Muhammadan religion, their agricultural occupation, and their 
subordinate position. In the great westein grazing grounds it i.s, 
as I have said, impossible to draw any sure line between Jat and 
Rcljput, the latter term being commonly applied to those tribes who 
havft attained political supremacy, w^hile the people whom they have 
subdued or driven by dispossession of their territory to live a semi- 
nomad life in the central steppes are more often classed as Jats; and 
the state of things in the Salt Range is very similar. Indeed tbe 
word Jat is the Punjabi term for a grazier or herdsman ; though Mr, i- 



368 The Jdt elements. 

E. O'Brien said tlubt in Jatki, Jat, theculHvator, is spelt with a hard 
and Jdt, the herdsman or camel grazier, with a sol't //. Thus iho 
word Jatin Rohtak or Amiitsar means a great deal; in MuzalFargarh 
or Baunu it means nothing at all, or rather perhaps it means a great 
deal more than any single word can afford to mean if it is to bo of 
any practical nse ; and the two classes respectively indicated by the 
term in these two parts of the Province must not be too readily 
confounded.' 

27ie Jdt elements. 
The traditions of some of the more important Jat tribes as to their 
orio-in are summed up below, but it must be confessed that these 
traditions are not only hazy but often inconsistent and not infrequently 
contradicted by legends current among the same tribe in another 
locality. 

Afghan origin is asserted by the Langah. Arab origin is claimed by 
the Tahim and Lilla. Brahman descent is alleged by the Golia and 
Lano'rial — who say they were ' Brahman Charans.' Jat descent is 
cidmitted by the Bhullar, Her, and Man ; by the Sipra (Gils by origin), 
the Bhangu, who say they came from Nepal, by the Wardich and 
\ apparently the Nol. Bdjpnt origin is vaguely alleged by the Bal, 
, (Jhhandbar Dhindisa (Saroha), Gliatwul (Saroha), Hijrd (Saroha), Mahal 
and Sumra. 

Other Jat tribes have more specific claims to Rajput ancestry. 
I'hus thlar Rajput origin is claimed by the Aulakh,* Bains,t Janjua, 
Bhutta, Buttar, Chabil (Tiinwar), Deo, Dhotar, Ithvval, Kang, Lodika, 
Pun nun, Sahi,Sindhu aud Tarar ; Lunar Rajput by theDhillou (Saroha), 
Ghumman, Goraya (Saroha), Kahlou. 

And in many cases the Jat tribe can point to the Rajput tribe from 
which it sprang. For example, Bliatti Rajput descent is claimed by th© 
Dhai iwal, Randhawa, Sara,t and Sidhu ; Chauhaa Rajput descent by the 
Ahlawat, Bajwa, Chatta, Chima, Dehia, Jakhar, Marral, Sargwan, and 
kSohal: Manhas Rajput blood by the Wirk : Punwar Rajput descent by 
the Kharral, Harral and Sarai : Raghobansi Rajput origiu by Gil : 
Tunwar, by the Dhankar, Rdthi and Sahrawat : aud Rutlior by the Dalai 
and Deswal. 

Similarly, in Gujrat the Muliainmaclau Jiil tribes claim very diverse origiii.s. Thus 
Ji 1(1/ /lai origin is claimed by the Bliaddar, Malaua, ^larar ami Narwai, who claim to be 
Barlas ; aud by the Bahlam, Chaughatta, Phiplira, Mauder aud Babal, who claim to be 
Chaiighalta. Aa-un origin is claimed by the BhagAval, while the Hir claim to be descend- 
auts of Qutab-ud-Din, like the Aw;lns and Khokhard. QuraisJi descent is claimed by the 
Jam. 

Khokhar Rajput descent is asserted by the Jali ; Puuwar Rajput ancestry is claimed by the 
Jakkhar and Sial; Sombansi descent and Rajput ancestry, i. c, a last status as Rajputs- 
are claimed by the Jaujua Jats, Chauh^n Jyts, Dhul, Suhial, Kalial, Goraya, Laugarbal, 
Maral, and Maugat; Janjua Rajpul origiu is claimed by the Bhakbel, Tatla, Dabb, 
Kaujial aud Ghummau; Gakkhar origiu is asserted by the Kotharmal; Bhalti Rajput origiu 
is claimed by the Bhatti, Dhariwal I'aroi, Tora, DhamiU. Dhali, Kaudhjivva, tiahotra, Soja, 
Surai, Kalw41, Kaher, kawar, Korantana, Guhlo Gudho, Gujral, Lidclar, Mehar, Mahota 



* But OUG tradition makes them Lunar. 

I Bains is ono of the c5(j royal families of Rajputs, but was believed by Tod tu be 
Suryabansi. 
J Also claim Lunar descent.

The Jdt localisation. 369 

Multani, Nijjri, Ilunjar and Ilatian; Punnu (Surajbansi) origin is claimed by the Dudhrai 
Poti, Gil, Thuth'il, Mathi, Nat ; Raghbansi by the Rahang Chauhan ; Rajput origin is claimed 
by the Thanel, Gobi and Kaler; Tiir Rajput descent is claimed by the Takkhar ; Langah 
Rajputs gave birth to the Cbtch, and Manhas to the Raihsi, Katwar Lohdra, Mahr, ilair, 
Nangiil and Wirk ; Gondal Jat extraction is admitted by the Tola, Jaspal, Sandrana, and 
Ghug; Waraich by the Suggar; Dhariwal by the Sidh, and Ranjha by the Khamb, 
Qudgor. 

Disti'ibution of the Jdts. 

Beyond the Punjab, Jdts are chiefly found ia Sindh where 
they form the mass of the population; in Bikdner, Jaisalmer, and 
Mdrwar, where they probably equal in numbers all the Rajput 
races put together, and along the upper valleys of the Ganges 
and Jumna, from Bareli, Farrukhabiid, and Gwalior upwards. In the 
Punjab and North-West Frontier Province they are especially 
riumerous in the central Sikh districts and Srate?, in the south-eastern 
districts, and in the Derajdt. Under and among the hills and in the 
Ed.walpindi divisiou Rajputs take their place, while on the frontier, 
both upper aud lower, they are almost wholly confined to the cis-Indus 
tracts and the immediate Indus riveraiu on both sides of the stream. 
The Jdts of the Indus are probably still in the country which they 
have occupied ever since their first entry into India, though they have 
been driven back from the foot of the Sulaimdns on to the river by the 
advance of the Patlidn and the Baloch. The Jats of the Western Plains 
have almost without exception come up the river valleys from Sindh 
or Western Rdjputana. The Jdts of the western and central sub- 
montane have also in part come by the same route ; but some of them 
retain a traditional connection with Ghazni, which perhaps refers to the 
ancient Gajnipur, the site of the modern Rdwalpindi, while many of 
them trace their origin from the Jammu Hills. 

The Jats of the central and eastern Punjab have also in many cases 
come up the Sutlej valley ; but many of them have moved from Bikdner 
straight into the Mdlwa, while the great central plains of the Mdlwa 
itself are probably the original home of many of the Jdt tribes of the 
Sikh tract. The Jdts of the south-eastern districts and the Jumna zone 
have for the most part worked up the Jumna valley from the direction 
of Bhartpur, with which some of them still retain a traditional connec* 
tion ; though some few have moved in eastwards from Bikdner and the 
Mdlwa. The Bhartpur Jdts are themselves said to be immigrants who 
left the banks of the Indus in the time of Aurangzeb. Whether the 
Jdts of the e:reat plains are really as late immigrants as they represent, 
or whether their story is merely founded upon a wish to sliow recent 
connection with the country of the Rdjputs, I cannot say. The whole 
question is one in which wo are still exceedingly ignorant, and which 
would riclily repay detailed investigation. 

The Jdt migrations. 

A noteworthy feature of the Jdt traditions is their insistence 
on the recent advent of nearly every Jdt tribe into the Punjab, 
or at least into its present seats. Probably the only tract in 
the Punjab in which the J;U has been well established Ircm a 
period anterior to the first Muh&minadan invasion is the Eohtak

territory. If tho history of tlie various tribes in Mult^m be investigated 
it will bo found that there is scarcely a single important tribe now found 
in the District which has not immigrated within the last «500 or 600 
years. Tho whole population in Multdn has for many centuries been 
in a state of constant flux, and it is of very little use trying to discover 
who the original inhabitants were even in the pre-Muhammadan 
times The Khaks, Pdudas, Pahors and Sahus in Kabirw^la tahsil, 
the Dhudhis in Mailsi, and the Kharas, nortli of Multan, are reputed 
vaguely to have been converted to Isldm in the Multdn districi. during 
tho 13th century, but the traditions cannot be trusted. When the Ain-i- 
Ahhari was compiled the Sahus, Sandas, Marrals, Tahims, Ghallus, 
Channars, Joiyas, Utheras and Khichis were settled in or near their 
present seats, and tradition assigns many tribal immigrations to Akbar'a 
time.* The same might bo said with much truth of almost every Jd.t 
Bottlemont throughout the Punjab plains. If we except the Nol and 
Bhangu in Jhang, the Hinjra in Gujrdnwala and a few other clans, 
tradition almost always makes a Jat tribe a comparatively recent 
settler in the Punjab. In Dera Ismail Khan, where the term Jdt is 
applied to Sidls, A.wdns and a host of petty tribes of miscellaneous 
origin, the lower portion of the District was probably occupied by a 
few scattered tribes of pastoralJats before the J 5th century. Early in 
that century all tradition goes to show that an immigration of 
Siyars, China, Khokhars, etc., set in from Multan and Bahd,walpur. 
Passing up tho Indus these Jat tribes gradually occupied the country 
on the edge of the Midnwdli Thai and then crossed the Indus. East 
of that river the Jd,ts and Sayyids maintained a dominant position, in 
spite of the somewhat later Baloch immigration which was of the 
natme of a military occupation rather than a permanent colonisation, 
and the whole of the Kachi or riverain on the east bank of the Indus 
was divided in blocks among the Jd,ts, a strip of the Thai or steppe 
being attached to each block, l&t tribes settled also in the Thai itself, 
notably the Chinasi and Bhidwdl, the latter a good fighting tribe. The 
China tract stretched right across the Thai. The modern District of 
Dera Ismail Khfin was settled in much the same way by the Jd,ts, but 
the Baloch also occupied it as cultivating proprietors, leaving the 
actual occupation however to the Jd,ts. Early in the 19th century 
Sarwar Khdn of Tdnk located large numbers of Jats in the 
south-east of the present Tdnk tahsil and this settlement gave the tract 
its name of the Jd,t-d,tar.t Jats however appear to have been settled 
in the modern Nutkdni Baloch country prior to that period, and to 
have formed its original population. 

The migrations of the Jats into Kapurthala also illustrate the history of the population 
of the Punjab. Thus from Amritsar came the Gil, Padah, Ojla, Dhol, Randhawa, Khera 
and Samrai ; from Hoshiirpur the Dhadwal ; from Sialkot came the Bajw4 or Bajwai, 
Gor^ya and Ghumman ; from Gurdaspur the Mahesh ; and from Lahore the AVirk, Sindhu 
and Bhullar ; from Gujranwala came the Dhotar, Baraich (Waraich), Panglai, Kaler and 
Johal, Sujan and Bat;;ah ; from the Malwa the Dhariwal ; and from Patiala the Chabil; from 
Delhi'came theHundal, Dhadah, Bhaun, Bal, Bhandal, Bisal and Bulai ; from Sirsa thi 

• See Mr. E. D. Maclagan's interesting sketch of the tribal immigrations in the Multan 
Oatetteer, 1901-02, pp. 144-5. 

f There is also a Jatatar in Gujrat— see p. 306 swpra. It appears to be identical with 
the Herat, which may derive its name from the Her Jats, though a local tradition derives 
ifc from Htrat in Afghanistan. It is curious that the Jats give their name to no other 
tracts. 



Jdt cults. 371 

Basrai and Daulal ; Avhilc from beyond the east of the Jumna came the Nijhar and Janer ; 
and from Sah^ranpur, the Dhillon : while the Baich say thoy camo from the Ganges. The 
Faddah have a tradition that they came from Ghazni. 

The cults of the Jdt tribes. 

The Jd,ts of the Punjab cannot be said to have any distinctive tribal 
cults. When Muhammadans or Sikhs tlicy follow the teachings of 
their creeds Avith varying degrees of strictness. When Hindus they 
are very often Sultanis or followers of the popular and wide-spread 
cult of Sakhi Sarwar Sultdn. In the south-east many aro Bishnois. 
The Shib-gotri Jats do not form a sectarian group. The only distinc- 
tive Jdt cults are tribal, and even in their case the sidh or sati, Jogi, 
Gosd,in or Bainigi, whoso shrine is affected by the tribe, is doubtless 
worshipped by people of other tribes in the locality. For detailed 
accounts of these tribal cults reference must be made to the separate 
articles on the various Jdt tribes in these volumes, but a few general 
notes may be recorded here. It will be observed that these customs are 
not as distinctive of the Jdts of Sialkot as Sir Denzil Ibbetson thought.* 
Parallels to them will also be found among the Khatris, and it is very 
doubtful whether they can be held to indicate aboriginal descent. 

Jathera. — Among the Hindu and Sikh Jats, especially in the north- 
central and central Districts^ a form of ancestor-worship, called jathera, 
is common. It is the custom of many clans, or of a group of villages 
of one clan, for the bridegroom at his wedding [hidh or shddi) to 
proceed to a spot set aside to commemorate some ancestor who was either 
a shah id (martyr) or a man of some note. This spot is marked by a 
mound of earth, or it may be a pakkd shrine. Ihe bridegroom bows his 
head to the spot and walks round it, after which offerings are made 
both to the Brahman and the Idgi.f If the mound is of earth, he throws 
a handful of earth upon it. The name given to the jathera may be, 
and generally is, that of an ancestor who was influential, the founder of 
the tribe, or who was a shahid. 

Jandi kalna or Jandidn, the cutting of a twig of the jand tree.— 
The bridegroom, before setting out for the marriage, cuts with a sword 
or talwdr a twig from a jand tree anywhere in th^ vicinity. He then 
makes offerings to Brahmans. This ceremony ensures the success of 
his marriage. 

In those parts of the Gurgaon District which adjoin the Jaipur, Alwar 
and Ncibha States it is customary to fix a small wooden bird on the 
outer door of the l)ride's house, and before the bridegroom is welcomed 
by the women standing there he is required to strike it with his stick. 
This ensures the happiness of the marriage. The rite is reminiscent of 
the old Tar Pariksha or test of the bride. The bird is made of jand 
wood. This is almost the only trace of any jandidn ceremony in tho 
southern Punjab.^ 

* Ibbetson, § 421. 

+ The menial who is entitled to receive dues (Mg) at weddings, etc. 

J la Hiasar the janduin rite ia rare, thousb that oi jut Iter a in said to be almost universal. 
But in that District tho observances are local, rather tliau tribal and the B4gii Jati do 
nob perform the jatt^lidn in HiaBtir though they would obsorve it in the Bigaj", wharo it is 
general. 



372 The chliatra rite. 

The jandian rite is very common in the central Punjab,* but it as- 
sumes slightly different forms. Thus among the Hans Jilts of Ludhidna 
the bridco-room's uncle or elder brother cuts the tree with an axe or 
sword and the bridal pair play with the twigs, chhitidn, the boy first 
striking the girl hoven times with them, and she then doing the same 
to him. Worship is then offered to a Brahman and after that the 
house-Tvalls are marked with rice-flour. The pair solemnly prostrate 
themselves, worship Sakhi Sarwar and give tlie offerings made to him 
to a Bhardi. The Daleo, Aulakh, Pammar, Basi, Dulat, Boparai, and Bal, 
have the same usage as regards the chhitidn, but among the Gurum 
Jdts the boy himself cuts the tree and both he and his bride 'worship 
chhairas.' But the Lat do not cut the j an di at all. 

CMiatra. — In connection with the observance, common at Hindu 
weddino's, of the tika, there is a curious custom called the chhatra (ram) 
or clihedna (to bore — the ram's ear), ]n this a ram is hired, 8 paisa 
(Nanak-shahi) being paid to its owner. The bridegroom cuts off a 
small piece of its ear and rubs this pii ce on the cut till the blood flows. 
He then places the piece in the centre of a chapdtl, with some rice 
and, smearing his thumb with the ivixture, imprints a tika or mark 
with it on his forehead. The chapdti is then offered at a shrine, 
food is distributed and the Idgis each receive at least 14 paisa (Ndnak- 
shd,hi). In some cases the ram or goat is also sacrificed. 

Among the J^ts of the south-eastern Punjab the chhatra rite, involv- 
ino- as it does animal sacrifice, is unknown. This is clearly due to Jaia 
influences. It is very rare in the central Districts too, and is said to 
be unknown in JuUundur, but in Ludhidna it is not uncommon for the 
bridegroom's forehead to be marked with blood from a goat's ear, e. g. 
among the Chela, Bhangu and some others. 

Not only do these us:iges vary among different tribes, some not 
observing them at all while others perform one or two or all of them, 
but a given tribe may have varying usages in different localities. 
Thus the Bhulars' cult of Kalanjar has already been described at 
p. 108 supra, but they are also said to have a jathera called Pir 
Yar Bhuraw^la,t a revered ancestor who performed a miracle by turning 
a blanket into a sheep, and to this day the Bhular will not wear, sit 
or sleep on a striped blanket. Their Sidh Kalenjar or Kalangar is also 
called Kalandra, and he has a tomb at Mari in Pati^la where the first 
milk of a cow is « fiered to him on the 8th hacli of t-he month. A 
Bhular too can only build a house after offering him two bricks. The 
Bhular also avoid the use of ak fuel. 

The Chahil as noted on p, 146 sup>ra affect a Jogi p)ir, but he is 
also said to have been their j at Jiera. He was killed in a fight with the 
Bhalti Rdjputs at a place in Patiala, but his body remanied on his 
horse and continued to smite the foe after his head had fallen, so a 
Bhrine was built to him on the spot where he fell and it also contains

licht brown with black t^tripes, or black with white stripes, and the Bhurd are also said 
to be a division of the Jilts. Bhvrd also means brown, P«»jd6i; Dicty., p. 146. Clearly 
there ii either a pun iu the name or Bhurd was the original name of the tribe.

the tombs of his hawk, dog and horse. It Hes in a grove, and tho 
milk of a cow or the grain of a harvest arc never used witlioui olTering 
first fruits to this pi'r. Tho fact that the ptV is called or named Jogi 
points to a Shaiva origin for the cult. 

The Chima again are said to be served by Jogis, and not by Crahmans. 
They perform ,/a,^/iera. and chhatra as follows : — Eight or ten days before 
a marriage rice is cooked and taken to the spot dedicated to their 
ancestor ; from one to five goata are also taken thither and Avashed 
and a lamp is lighted. One of tho goats' ears is then cat, and tho 
brotherhood mark their foreheads with blood {chhatra). The goat is 
killed for food, but the immediate relatives of the bride do not eat of 
its flesh, which is divided among the others ; the rice, however, is 
distributed to all. 

The Deo have their jathera at a place close to some pool or tank 
where on certain occasions, such as a wedding, they congregate. The 
Brahman marks each man's forehead as he comes out of the pool with 
blood from the goat's ear : this is done to the bridegroom also. Tho 
bread at the feast is divided, 9 loaves to every bachelor and 18 to every 
married man. 

As already noted, on p. 236 supra, the Dhctriwitl have a jathera 
and also a sidh, called Bhai or Bhoi. The latter was slain by robbers. 
A Brahman, a Mirasi, a Chuhra and a black dog were with him at tho 
time. The Brahman fled, but tho others remained, and so Mirasia 
receive his offerings, and at certain ceremonies a black dog is fed first. 
The Sidh's tomb is at Ldlowala in Patidla^ and his fair is held on tho 
Nimdni Ikddshi. 

The Dhillon appear to have several jatheras, Gaggowahna being 
mentioned in addition to those described on p. 238 supra. No particu- 
lars of these are forthcoming. But the fact that Dhillon was Raja 
Karn's grandson is commemorated in the following tale : — Karn used 
to give away 30 ,sers of gold every day after his bath but before his 
food. After his death the deity rewarded him with gold, but allowed 
him no food, so he begged to bo allowed to return to the world where 
he set aside 15 days in each year for the feeding of Brahmans. He 
was then allowed to return to the celestial regions and given food."^ 

Other jV/./ieras are Baba Alho, of the Gakewals, Raja Ram of tho 
Gils, Rtijput [sic] of the Kiiaika, Sidhsan, of the Bandhawas, Tilkara, 
of the SiDHDS and Kdla Mihr of tho SiNDiius.t 

The Dhindsa have a sidh, of unrecorded name, at a place in Patiitla 
and offer milk, etc., to his samddh on the Gth siidi of each month. The 

* The Dhillons have the following kabit or saying — Sat Jindki bahiii, Dhillon kadh kosatti 
nahin, meaning that a Dhillon will iihvaj's perform what he has promiscil. 

■f" Among the genuine Jats, or those who can look back to a Rajput origin, it is not 
uncommon to find a great veneration paid to the thelis or mounds which in bygone days 
were the sites of their first location. They are marked by a few scattered tombs or a grove 
of trees, or have since been selected by some shrivelled fiujir as the place suitable for a 
solitary life. With the Jats, it is also curious to which Ihe revciencc they pay to the 
_;(ni(/ tree, which is often introduced into these places of worship. Tiie liajputs are more 
lofly in their religion, and more rigorous in their discharge of it."— Prinsep's Sialkof 
Sett. Rep., p. 27. 



374 Tribal vs. Village deities. 

Gil sidh is named Surat Rdm and only gets a goat and a handful of gur 
at weddings, an offering which is taken by Mirdsis. The Gandi have 
a sati whose mat or shrine is in Patid,la. 

Jatheras are also commonly worshipped in the central Districts, but 
the rites vary. Thus in Ludhidna nearly every Jd,t tribe has a jathera 
though his name is rarely preserved, and a very common fond of wor- 
ship to him is to dig earth from a tank at weddings in his honour. 
Thus Tulla, the Basis' jathera, who has a niat or shrine, is com- 
memorated in this way and earth is also dug on the Diwdli night. The 
Sarapiya and Sodi Jiits also dig earth to their unnamed jai/ieras— and 
the Daula, Dhad, Sangra and many others do the same. The Dhanesar 
have a special custom, for after the jandi has been cut, water is poured 
over a goat's head, and if he shivers the ancestors are believed to have 
blessed the pair. The goat is then set free. The Ghanghas in this 
District appear to have no jathera but make offerings, which are taken 
by Sikhs, to the samddh of Ak61 Das, their ancestor, at Jandid,la in 
Amritsar, where an annual fair is held. 

Thus the jathera rite is essentially a tribal, not a village, institution 
and this is strikingly brought out by the fact that in villages composed 
of several tribes each tribe will have its own jathera. Thus in Kang, in 
Jullundur, the Kang J^ts have no jathera, but they have one atDhauli 
Mambli in Garhshankar tahsil, and say he was a refugee from Mu- 
hammadan oppression. The Mors of Kang have their jathera at 
Khankhana, the Birks theirs at Birk, the Rakkars theirs at Rakkar, 
the Jhalli theirs at Dhamot in Ludhiana. But the jathera is often a 
sati, and the Her in Jullundur have a sati's shrine at Kd,la Majra in 
Rupar tahsil. And it is not necessarily the progenitor of the clan, or 
even the founder of a village who is worshipped, but any prominent 
member of it who may be chosen as its jathera. Thus among the 
Dhillon of Mahrampur it is not Gola, its founder, who is worshipped, 
but Phalla, his descendant and a man of some note. And at Garcha 
the Garcha Jdts worship Adhiana, a spot in the village named after 
Adi, one of their ancestors who was an ascetic. The place now forms 
a grove from which fuel may be gathered by Brahmans, but no wood 
may be cut by Jats under penalty of sickness or disaster. When the 
jathera is at any distance it is suflScient to turn towards it at a v/edding 
and it is only visited at long intervals. 

In marked contrast to the tribal jathera is the village hhumia of the 
south-eastern Punjab. There, when a new colony or village is founded 
in the south-east Punjab the first thing to be done before houses are 
actually built is to raise a mound of earth on a spot near the proposed 
village and plant a jau^tree on it. Houses are then built. The first man 
who dies in the village, whether he be a Brahman, a J^t or a Chamdr, 
is burnt or buried on this mound, and on it is built a masonry shrine 
which is named after him. The fortunate man is deified as the Bhfimia 
or earth-god, and worshipped by Hindus of all classes in the village, 
being looked upon as its sole guardian deity. At weddings the bride- 
groom before starting to the bride's village resorts to this shrine and 
makes offerings to him. If an ox is stolen, a house is broken into, or 
pestilence breaks out, if crops fail or the rainfall is scanty, if locusts

visit the village or any other calamity befall, Bhumia's shrine is the 
first place to which the Jats resort for divine help. 

Such faith is placed in this deity that in the event of plague I ho 
villagers will not vacate their houses without consulting the Bhuniia. 

Thus in Jind we find the Phooat with a tribal Sidh and also a I3humi;i 
in every village. Nearly every Jat tribe in that State has its lihumia, 
but some have a Khera instead, and others again stylo their jafJbera 
Khera Bhumia. Such are tlie Chahil. Tlio Labanah affect the" ICliera 
alone. The Dalai reverence Jogis aud the Bhanwala Gosains, while the 
Gathwdl and Larabo are said to have Bairdgis as their jatheras ; and 
the Ridhu have Ndgiis ior jatheras, but also worship Kliera Bhiimia. 
Probably the Jogi, Bairdgi, Gosdin or Ndgd is the tribal, and the KheiM 
the village deity or his representative. But several tribes, the Bhor.dar, 
Bhangu, Kharod, Uadhdna and Tanidna worship the Khera as their 
jafkera, and a few, the Baring, Baniwdl, Boparai, Jatdna, Khagura, 
Ldt, Sohi, Thand and Tur have no jathera at all. 

Instances of Jdts accepting votive offerings appear to be very rare, but 
Jats, not Brahmans, take the offerings made in cash or kind at the 
shrine of Sitla Devi at Gurgdon. 

The divisions of the Jdts. 
The Jats of the south-east Punjab have two territorial divisions Des- 
wdli from des, the plain or country, and Bdgri, from the hagar or upland 
in Bikdner. The Deswdli claim to be superior to the latter, but it is 
often difficult to say to which group a tribe belongs. Thus the Bhaini- 
wdl claim to be Deswdli, but they are really Bdgri as are probably the 
Chahals — whose connection with the legend of Guga is consistent with 
their immigration from the Bdgar. 

The Jdts of the south-east have also two other divisions, Shib-o-otra 
and Kdshib-gotra. The former are also called asl or real Jdts and%on- 
fess that their progenitor sprang from Shiva's matted hair and was so 
called ja^ hhadrd. They have 12 gots, which are descended from the 
12 sons of Barh, who conquered a large part of Bikdner. His descend- 
ants are chiefly sprung from Punia aud they held the country round 
Jhansal. 



These 12 gots are —

not to form exogamous groups, but only to marry with tlie Kdshib-

form exogamous sections, though it may be that, as a general rule, they 
give daughters to the Kashib-gotra. The term Shib-gotra clearly implies 
some disparagement, but the Tunia were ouce an important tribe be- 
cause there used to be six cantons of Jdts on the borders of Mariana and 
Bikaner, and of these four, viz., Punia, Kassua,"^ Sheoran and Godd,ra

but very rarely is any reverence paid to the totem. Such are :— ' 

Karir, a tree, Kohar, a hatchet, Waihri, a young heifer, Bandar,

pipal, and Jandi^, jand tree, all in tahsil H^nsi. The Jaria and 
others are said to be named from parts of the 6er tree, but Jaria 
itself is also explained as meaning 'descended from twins, J07'a,' and 
they are said lo be an offshoot of the Gathwdl. Mor is so called 
because a peacock protected their ancestor from a snake. Pankhal, 
peacock^s feather, is so called because a Dohd,n Jat girl had been given 
in marriage to one Tetha, a Rajput of Musham. The couple disagreed and 
Tetha aided by the royal forces attacked the tribe and only those who 
had placed peacock^s feathers on their heads were spared.

Social distinctions among the Jdh. 

Among the Jilts the only* social distmctions are the well-known 
'Akbari' or Darb^ri 7?ia/ia7i5— 35 in number according to the usual 
account. But in Amritsar the Akbari is only the highest of a series of 
four grades, the Aurangzebi (or those admitted to this rank in the 
time of Aurangzeb), Khalsiii (or those admitted in Sikli times) and 
Angrezi (or those admitted since British rule began) being tlio other 
three, and no less than 150 villages, all generally speaking in the 
Mdnjlia, now claim Darbitri status. There is also a Sliahjalidni grade, 
the Sdnsi Jdts, of R^ija Sdnsi, having been admitted in the reii^u of 
Shiih Jahan. The origin of the Akbari group is thus described. When 
the emperor Akbar took in marriage the daugliter of Mihr Mitha, a J^it, 
of the Manjha,t 35 of the principal Jat, and 3G of the leading Kajput 
families countenanced the marriage and sent representatives to Delhi. 
Three of those Jdt families are still found in Hoshidrpur, and are cr.lleil 
the Dhdighar Akbari, as they comprise the Bains JatsJ of Miihilpur, 
the Lahotas of Garhdiwaln and the Khungas of Budhipind, which latt'^r 
is styled the 'half family, so that the three families are calhd the 2^ 
{dhdighar). The Akbari Jats follovr some of the higher castes in not 
allowing remarriage of widows, and in practising darhdra, which is a 
custom of giving vails at weddings to the lairntiis of other Akbari 
families. Their parohits also place the jVwjeo on them at their mar- 
riages, removing it a few days afterwards. Below the Akbari (according 
to the Hoshidrpur account) is the Darbdri grade, descendants of those 
who gave daughters to the emperor Jah^ngir. Thus some of the Mdn 
Jats ai'e Darbdris, and they will only marry with Darbaris as a rule. 
But they will accept brides from Jats of grades below the Darbari 
provided the dower {dahej) is sufficiently large. 

As regards Gurdd,spur, Sir Louis Dane wrote : — " Some of the better 
gats of Hindu Jats or those living in celebrated villages or wamas will 
not give their daughters to men oi gots considered socially inferior, and 
the restriction often gave rise to female infanticide, as eligible hus- 
bands were scarce."

* Mr. J. R. Drummond indeed observed :— " There can be no question that the Randhi- 
was, who arc still Thikurs in their native homes, I believe, in Rajputana, are at the head 
of the hypergamou3 scale among those .Tats who have a more or less distinctly Rajput 
origin, such as the Gil, Sindhu, Sidhu-Barar (or Variar). Pannu and the like.'' Unfor- 
tunately no one seems able to say what the hypergamous scale among the Jit c/ots is, and 
several informants explicitly say that there is none. 

t The Mihr Mitha who fi^nres in the tradition of the Dliaiiwals must be intended. It 
18 hardly necessary to saj' that neither Akbar nor Jahiingir ever took a Jat bride. 

X The iiains Jat have a Idra or proup of 12 villages near Mahilpnr, bnt the posFession 
of a bdra does not appear to make the Gil Sanghe or Pote Jats Akb.nri though they too 
possess hdras. The Man too Lave a hdra, but seme of tbem are only Darbaii and not all 
of them have that standing.

Jatowal, a Muhammadan J at clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Jatu, a Rajput tribe, said to be a Tunwar clan who once held almost the 
whole of Hissdr, and are still most numerous in that District and the 
neighbouring portions of Hohtak and Jind. When the great Chauhan 
Bisaldeo overthrew Anangpdl II, the Tunwar king of Delhi, the 
Tdnwars were driven from Delhi to Jdlopattan in the Sheikhawatti 
country north of Jaipur and there Dul R^m, a descendant of Anangpdl, 
ruled. His son Jair^t extended the Tunwar dominion to Bagar in Jaipur 
and the tract is still called the Tunwarwati, In fact the Tunwar of 
Haridna are said to have been divided into three clans named after and 
descended from, three brothers, Jatu, Raghu and Satraula, of which 
clans .Mtu was by far the largest and most important, and once ruled 
from Bhiwd^ni to Agroha. They are the hereditary enemies of the Punwdr 
of Rohtak, and at length the sandhills of Mahm were fixed upon as the 
boundary between them, and are still known as Jdtii Punwdr ka daula 
or the Jatu-Punwdr boundary. In Karnal, however, the Jdtu describe 
themselves as Chauhan also. 

Jaird-t, the Tunwar, had a son, Jdtu, (so-called because he bad hair, 
jdta, on him at the time of his birth) by a Sankla Rd,jputni, and his 
son migrated to Sirsa where he married Paldt Devi, daughter of 
Kanwarpdl, a Siroh^ Rd.jp ut and sister of the mother of the great Guga 
Fir. Kanwarpal made the tract about Hdnsi over to his son-in-law and 
the latter sent for his brothers Raghu and Satraula from Jilopattan to 
share it with him. Jdtu's sons, Sidh and Harpdl, founded Rdjli and 
Gurdna villages, and on the overthrow of the Chauhan Kai Pithaura by 
the Muhammadans the Jd,tus extended their power over Agroha, Bd,nsi, 
Hissar and Bhiwd,ni, their boast being that they once ruled 1,440 kheras 
or settlements. Amrata also seized 40 villages in the Kdnaud (Mohin- 
dargarh) ilirja of Patidla. The three brothers, Jatu, Raghu and 
Satraula divided the pargana of Hansi into three tappas, each named 
after one of themselves. Umr Singh, one of theii descendants took 
Toshdm, and after him that ildqa was named the Umrain lappa, while 
that of Bliiwani was called the Bachwdu lappa, after one Bacho, a Jdtu. 
At Siwsni Jdtu's descendants bore the title of Rai, those of Talwandi 
Rdn^ that of Ran^, while those at Kulheri were called Chaudhri. In

191. BabaJo wahir Singh, a Sikh saint, has numerous followers in the north- . 
eastern Punjab, amongst both Hindus and Sikhs. Thei 
number now registered is, however, mach smaller than that 
returned in 1891 (as shown in the margia). Baba Jowahir 
Smgh was the grandson of Ganga Da's, one of the disciples of 
Amar Das, the 3rd Sikh Guru. There is a temple at 
Khatkar Kalaa m the Juliundui- District, dedicated to his name and a 
pond in the Ajmergarh Parganah of the Patiala State is held sacred to his 
memory. This poad known as Johdrji is said to be of great sanctity and the 
story related by the followers of Baba Jowahir Siogh at this place is somewhat 
different to that noted by Mr. Maclagan in paragraph 97 of the Punjab 
Census Report, 1891. This place is supposed to be associated with the death of 
Sarwan at the hands of Dasharatha, father of Rama. The particular spot where 
the tragedy is believed to have been enacted is marked to the south-east of the 
Joharji. The pond lies in the centre, encircled by two streams, one named 
Kaushalya (after Rama's mother) which flows in the natural course from north 
to south, and the other called Kekai (name of Rama's step-mother) folio winc^ 
an abnormal course from south to north. The unnatural course of the latte° 
stream is ascribed to the perverse attitude taken up by Kekai, the queen of 
Dasharatha, in connection with the exile of Rama. King Dasharatha, they say, 
had a palace on the ridge with abodes for the Ranis. The pond was subsequently 
possessed by a man-eating R^kshasa (demon) named Mabiya. Baba Jowahir Singh 
killed him by his Yoga power and rid the place of his oppression. The Phauri 
(wooden instrument for removing litter) with which he struck the demon is 
preserved in the temple built by the late Maharaja Narendra Singh of Patiala. 
But Mahiya is said to have prayed to the Baba Sahib for a blessing, and this 
was granted, the Baba assuring him that all the pilgrims would worship him 
(the demon) as well. All pilgrims, therefore, after making their obeisance at the 
temple of Baba Jowahir Singh, offer a goat in the name of Mahiya. The place 
where Mahiya died is also marked.

1867 the people at once revived all their ancient titles, but the descen- 
dants of Harpal, a son of Jdtu, remained loyal, the descendants of Siidb, 
another of Jatu's sons, having rebelled. 

The Jdfus, Raghus and Satraulas do not, it is said, intermarry. The 
Jdtus are nearly half Hindus, the rest being Muhaminadans. The

claim kinship with the Bha^tis, but now intermarry with Jiits. 

JjBTHAL, a small clan, found only in the Jhelum Thai between the river of 
that name and the Lilla estates. It claims Bhatti Rajput descent, but 
its pedigree is traced to Bhntta who some 12 or 14 generations ago 
married the sister of Ghorian king's wife. The king, however, drove 
Bhutta with his 21 sons into the Bar, whence Jethal crossed the Jhelum 
and settled at Ratta Find, now a mound near Kandwdl. They also 
say they were settled at Neh of Sayyid Jaldl in Bahawalpur which 
points to descent from the Bhuttas of Multdn. They usually inter- 
marry among themselves, but occasionally with the Lillas. Omitting 
the mixture of Hindu and Musalmdn names which appears in the 
earlier part of their pedigree table, it is given as follows : —

880 Jhahel'-^Jhajhar. 

Jhabel (or as they are called in the Ain-i-Alihari Chhabel), a fishing tribe 
found in the Multan and Muzaffargarh districts^ and in Jullundur, 
Hoshi^rpur, Kapurthala and Gurd^spur. Closely resembling the 
Kebals and Mors the Jhabels in Muzaffargarh once had the reputation 
of being canuibals. They live mainly by fishing and gathering pabhans 
(seeds of the water-lily), say they cnme from Sindh and of all the 
tribes in the District alone speak Sindhi. They also enjoy the title of 
Jam. Many have now taken to agriculture and all are reckoned good 
Muhammadans. They arc fond of growing samuka,^ a grain sown in 
the mud left by the rivers. In Gard^spur they say they came from 
the south, and that their ancestors were sportsmen, a Bhatti, founder of 
their Katre got, a Naru, from whom sprang their Nareh and Bhugge 
gots, and so on. They fell into poverty and took to selHng game. 
These Jhabels do not intermarry with those on the Indus and Sutlej, 
but only with those on the north bank of the latter river. Some are 
cultivators and even own land. Others are shikaris, but some are 
boatmen and they look down on those who are and refuse to marry 
with them. The Jhabels of Jullundur have the same usages as the 
Meuns and other fisher-folk of that District. Some of them, owing to 
want of employment as boatmen have left their villages for the towns 
and taken to tailoring, weaving, vieii-shiking, chaukiddri, and &m&\\ 
posts in Government service. 

The Jhabels also preserve tliGJhulka custom. The large fire needed 
for cooking the eatables required at a wedding must be lighted by a 
son-in-law of the family, but when he attempts to bring a blazing 
bundle (jhulka) of wood, etc., and put it under the furnace, he is met 
by all the females of the family and has to run the gauntlet, as they 
try to stop his progress with pitchers full of water, bricks, dust, and 
sticks. This game is played so seriously that the women's dresses 
often catch fire and they, as well as the son-in-law, are seriously hurt. 
When he finally succeeds in lighting the fire, the son-in-law gets a 
turban and a rupee, or more if the family is well-to-do. This usage is 
occasionally observed among Ardins, Dogars, and Gujars too, but it is 
falling out of fashion. 

Like the Meuns the Jhabels will not give the milk or curds of an 
animal which has recently calved to any one, not even to a son-in-Jaw, 
outside the family. After 10 or 20 days rice is cooked in the milk and 
it is given to onaulavis or to beggars. It can then be given away to 
anybody. The Jhabels are good Muhammadans, but revere Khwd,ja Pir 
or Khwdja Khizr, the god of water, and offer porridge to him in lucky 
quantities at least once a year. It is taken to the river or a well and 
after some prayers distributed there or in the village to all who are 
present. 

Jhab, a Jat clan (agricultural) found in Multan. 

Jhaik, a sept of Kaneis which derives its name from Jhd,lri in Rdwin pargana 
of J ubbal and supplies hererlitary u'aztVs to that State. At one time

Jhinwar, Jhiwar. The Jhinwar,* also called Kahdr in the east, and Mahra,t

fisherman and basket-maker of the east of the Punjab. He carries palan- 
quins and all such burdens as are borne by a yoke on the shoulders ; and 
he specially is concerned with water, insomuch that the cultivation of 
waternuts and the netting of water fowl are for the most part in his hands, 
and he is the well-sinker of the Province. He is a true village menial, 
receiving customary dues and performing customary sei'vice. In this 
capacity he supplies all the baskets needed by the cultivator, and brink's 
water to the men in the fields at harvest time, to the houses where the 
women are secluded, and at weddings and other similar occasions. His

Uahdr is a synonym for " chief " in the south-west of the Province. When employed as a 
waterman the Jhinwar is often called Panihari.

occupations in the centre and west of the Province are described under 
MAcHHi. His social standing is in one respect high ; for all will drink 
at his hands. But he is still a servant, though the highest of the class. 
The Bhishti, Mdshki and Saqqii, the terms for Musalm^n water- 
carriers, may be of other castes than Jhinwar, but as a rule they would 
belong to that caste. 

The Jhiwars, as a caste, are one of these occupational groups found 
in the Punjab which are conventionally called castes but which really 
include or overlap numerous other 'castes ' of similar status and kindred 
occupation. When a man of the Jhiwar caste is a baker or seller of 
ready-cooked food he is called and apparently becomes a Bhatidra by 
caste as well as by occupation. Similarly, the Jhiwar who parches gram 
is styled a Bhaybhunja in the east of the Punjab or a Bhojwa,* whereas 
in the west of the Province he remains a Jhiwar or rather a Mdchhi and 
is on the Indus styled a Chatdri. 

If the Jhiwar on the other hand plies a boat or skin for hire he will 
be called and become a Mallah, a Daryiii, a Dren, a Td,ru or even a 3&t 
or a Mohdna according to the locality in which he works, his religion, 
and the kind of craft he uses. Mallah is the most usual term for a boat- 
man but Moh^na which is said to rcean a fisherman in Sindh, is in the 
Punjab as often applied to a fisherman as to a boatman. The Daryd,i is 
a Persianised form of Drea, the Muhammadan waterman who ferries 
people across and down the rapid hill rivers on inflated hides. If a 
Hindu he is styled Td,ru. On the Indus the boatman ranks as and would 
be called simply a Jat. Lastly, the Machhi may acquire land, form a 
tribe and rank as a land-owning community under its own tribal chiefs, 
as in Bahdwalpur ; or the Dhinwars may sink to the level of a criminal 
tribe. But even these do not exhaust the synonyms and sub-divisions 
of the Jhinwar caste. 

As in the case of the Mdchhis, the sub-divisions of the Jhinwar are 
very numerous, the largest are the Khokhar, Mahdr, Bhatti, Manhds, 
Tank and Suh^l. These groups do not appear to be found in any num- 
bers among the Bhatyara or Bharbhunja. 

Jhiwar origins. 
Accordino" to one account Akis, a Chauhd,ti Rajput of Garh Mukhidla 
(in the Salt Range), died leaving a son of tender age named Dhiugar.

* The Bhoi'-va is also a grain -parcher. Bhujwas form an " occupational " rather than a 
regular caste and in the United Provinces include Kaj^aths, Ahirs, etc. In the Punjab 
Muhammadans also ply this trade and most of them are immigrants from the united Pro- 
Tinces wbo accompanied the British troops in the Sikh Wars,— N. I. N. Q. I., 313, 



JhiniDar groups. 888 

According to Sir Richard Temple'^ a Jliiwar Is said to Lave taken to 
wife RdniKokiMn, the guilty heroine of tlie Kitja Hasdlu legend and she 
had by him three sons from whom are spruDg the three Punjab gots^- 
Sabir, Gabir and Sir. 

Territorial groups. 

The territorial grouping of the Jhinwars is vague. In the Shakar- 
garh tahsil of Gurd^ispur is a Dogra group. In the Juliundur Dodb 
the groups appear to be three in number (/) Panjiibi or indigenous, {ii) 
BdngiUjt immigrants from the Bungai-, and (m) Chliangru. In Patidla 
we find the usual grouping, Deswd,l and Multdni, but in Jind B/ingru and 
Panjd,bi are reported. Lastly, in the south-east about Niirnaul are 
found the Biigris. 

The Bdngru do not intermarry with the Panjabis. The former ascribe 
their immigration to Akbar's reign, during which at the siege of Chitfcaur, 
a Jhiwar was killed and his brother desired to marry his widow, but she 
refused to consent and fled to the Bist dodha with her infant son. 

The remaining groups appear to bo usually, but not rigidly, en- 
dogamous. 

Occupatiotis and occupational groups. 

The Jhinwars are a remarkably composite caste and comprise several 
groups whose names depend on their various occupations, and indeed 
probably vary with the occupations they pursue from time to time. 
In the south-east we fiud DhinwarJ as a syuonym of Jhinwar. 

Kahdr may also be regarded as a synonym in the sense that it desig- 
nates a Jhiwar employed as a carrier, especially a doli-hearer. 

Sodiii is the term applied to a Jhinwar who has taken the pahul as a 
Sikh. The word means pure or puri6er and the Sodid is employed as 
a cleaner of utensils. Sikh Jhiwars are also employed as jhafknis or 
butchers who slaughter by ;7ta/A;a ; and in Sikh regiments they work 
as bakers [Idngris). 

We may thus regard the Jhinwar as par excellence the drawer of 
water and palanquin-bearer of the Hindu community, and Panihitrd, and 
Kahdr as synonyms of the caste, as a whole, So'lM being restricted to 
the Sikh Jhinwars. 

But the Jhinwar has many other occupations. His association with 
water confers on him such purity that he can enter any Hindu's kitchen, 
even a Brahman's ehauka, provided that culinary operations h:.ve not 
reached the point at which salt is mixed with the food. Nevertheless 
Brahmans, Khatris and even Banias will not eat kachi food at a Jhin- 
war's hands. 

But besides cookery the Jhinwar follows almost any occupation con- 
nected with water. He is a fisherman, or mdchhi, and sometimes a

boatman,* a sinker of wells, chohhd ; and in the villages he makes 
baskets, mats and fans. Last, but not least, the Jhinwar is a cultiva- 
tor, especially of the singhdra or water-nut. t 

Jhinwar women also follow divers callings. As a pure caste they 
parch grain, but they also act as midwives. 

Finally, there is a group of Jhinwars called Burid, or Budnd,J which 
appears to be the same as the Kalbut, Changar or Machhera group, and 
whose members live by extracting oil from animals and practise cup- 
ping [singi). This group is looked down upon by the other Jhinwars 
and is not allowed intermarriage with them. It thus forms an endo- 
gamous sub-caste, if indeed it can be regarded as a branch of the 
Jhinwars at all. 

Sometimes Saqqd;S, Mdchhis, Panjarid-s, Meos, Chirimd-ra, Chhanbals, 
Bor, Mir Shikaris, Malldhs, Bhatiards, Pakhiwdrd,s and Gagrds claim 
Jhinwar descent, or assert that they are jMnwars because they follow 
the same calling, but they have no real connection with the Jhinwar 
caste. Similarly, Ghirths, Chhangs and Bahtis work as water-carriers, 
etc., but they are not thereby Jhinwars. 

The social grouping of the Jhiwars is nebulous to a degree. One 
account divides them into 4 muhins, thus : — 

1. Mdhar. ") 

2. Naranid,. > Forming an endogamous group. 

3. Jamoe. i 

4. Budn^ov Buv[^^['^^f^^;^^^,^ 

The last, as already mentioned, being excluded from all social inter- 
course with Nos. 1 — 3. 

'The term Mahr \\ or Malird, however is applied to all Jhiwars, and it is 
generally understood in an honorific sense, though it is also said to 
mean effeminate and to be applied to the Jhiwars because they are 
employed in domestic service. Panch^ or headman is sometimes ap- 
plied to them. On the other hand, they are contemptuously termed 
Tdhli tap, or servile (?) and Bandar-zd,t or monkey cast© (?) 

in Gujrat the Jhiwar claim descent from the (Bdri) Khatris and are 
as such called Barhia Jhiwars. 

* They are said to have learnt the art of rowing from Manauti, Jhiwar, (Another 
account says Kalu bhagat was of the Manwauti got). 

t When the singhdra crop is ripe the family got is bidden to a feast, the amount spent 
being proportioned to the value of the crop and varying from 1:^ to 5^ seers, which quanti- 
ty, or its value is piven to the chela of Kalu bhagat, 

I In Karnal the Biidnas are also said to be called Kanchhi and to worship L41 Guru, as 
well as Kalu hhagat, 

§ The Jhinwars of Panipat in Karnil have two groups Mahir and Bodne or Eanchhis 
which are divided into a number of gots. 

II Mahr. H. = mehtar, chief headman, is applied to men of the Rain, Gujar and Jhiwar 
castes. In Panjabi it takes the forms mahir and mahird fem. mahiri. Platts says 
mahrd (an effeminate man) is applied to lahdrs because they have access to the women's 
apartments.

Jhinwar beliefs. 385 

The Cult of Kdlu Bliagat. 

The cult of KiXlu hhagat is professed by the Jhinwars in particular, 
and by members of a certain number of other castes also. Bdwd Kdlu 
was by caste a Hindu Jhiwar, of the Manauti got, born at Barial near 
Hari^na in Hoshidrpur and buried at Pancli Nangal in the same t»hsil. 
His temple, however, lies in Piinchhat, in the Kapiirthala State. Of 
his two sons Ganesha and Mahesha the latter alone left issue, so his 
descendants, who are styled Bdwds, live in the three above places and 
in Khutiar and Kahnpar also. They receive presents from the Hindu 
Jhiwars, as well as from some Stiliui Jilts, Chuhnts and Chamdrs. 

Various stories are told of Kdlu's origin. According to one Pdrbatf 
made a clay image of a boy and gave it life, leaving it near a well. 
Two women, a Brahmani and a Jhiwari, came to draw water, and each 
claimed the child. The village elders decided that it belonged to her 
from whose breasts milk Bowed, and the Jhiwari fulfilled this test. 
She named her child Kdlu or ' the dark one. ' As a boy Kdlu was 
employed as a cowherd, and a scidhu bade him milk an ox, which he 
did successfully. In remembrance the scidhu gave him his gudri 
(quilt) which conferred on bim omniscience. Then Kdlu wandered over 
the world until he came to Panch Nangal, where he died, and there 
his gudri and sandals {pavve) are preserved. 

Kdlu left four* disciples — Lachhmi Cliand, Sri Chand, Megh Chand 
and Tara Chand, from among whose descendants a priest is elected by 
divination. t He makes visitations to his followers, going every year 
or two to every part of the Province, and collecting alms. Each panc/ia- 
yat gives him Re. 1-4, and in return he bestows four cardamoms, 
and a red snd blue thread {Ganga-jamni-dhdga) at every mat. 
This thread is worn tied round the neck. Females are not pemitted 
to assume this thread, but they and the Jhiwar children of both sexes 
wear the kanthi, a necklace of black wool and cotton. 

' He who chooses the life of an ascetic,' — says Kdlu— 'of him both 
his enemy and his king ai^e afraid.' 

Another version is that Kdlu was a RajputJ who lived in Hastinapur. 
Once he was catching fish on the bank of the Jumnd against the order 
of the king, and seeing the king with his retinue coming towards him 
from a distance and being afraid, he threw his net, etc., into the river, 
rubbed earth on his body, so as to look like ^faqlr, closed his eyes and 
sat down near the bank of the river. As the king with his oflScials 
passed by, he supposed Kdlu to bo a faqir and throw some money to 
him. When the king had passed by, Kdlu opened his eyes and saw 
the money, and was so much impressed by the incident that he 
remained a/ajir till the end of his days, and spent the rest of his life as 



* Some add a fifth— Kanh Chand. 

t All the available persons are invited to a fpast, and dishes (chiefly of rice) are set 
before each and covered over with a cloth. After a few minutpg the cloths are removed 
and he, in whose dish worms are found, is elected. He must remain celibate and eat fruit 
only, not grain, except porridge made of sinokdra flonr. He receives all ofTerings made 
at the f^amddh. The idea underlying this rite of divination appears to be that he who hag 
given up eating grain, and before whom grain turns into worms is the destined priest.

" The garb of an ascetic, with marks of a sacred order on his person 
and a rosary on his neck, is a great thing. (Before it) even the Angel 
of Death shrinks back, says Kdlu, and a king is overtaken with fear."

The Jhinwars of Gurgdon are Kalubansi of the Boria Kanshiwala 
caste which contains 84 groups. 

Guild organisation. 

Despite its complex and perhaps heterogeneous character, the 
Jhinwar caste possesses a fairly strong guild organisation. Thus in 
Jind the caste has a sadr or principal chauntra, with sobordioate 
chauntras. Each chauntra has a chaudhri and two kotwdls as his 
assistants with a chohddr, who acts as convener of the panchdyat. In 
Eohtak district there are 6 Jhinwar thappas or jurisdictions which are 
apparently subordinate to the chaimtra at Rohtak itself, and in that 
town lives the chaudhri who has 84 villages under his control. Each 
village sends sarddrs or panch as its representatives to the chauntra. 
Delhi is the great centre of the Jhinwar guild in the south-east Punjab. 
Other accounts make the panch synonymous with the chaudhri and 
the organisation is doubtless as loose and elastic as such organisations 
usually are, though its strength is indisputable. The office of chaudhri 
is hereditary, as a rule, but if the^ successor is deemed incompetent 
election is resorted to. A chaudhri gives Idg on ceremonial occasions, 
receiving double hhdji. 

In Sidlkot the chaudhri or panch receives a turban and some money 
at festive gatherings. He has under him a fcoiwdZ or messenger, and 
hedhaks or singers, who sing on such occasions.f 

The Dhinwars have already been noticed, but fuller information as to 
their organisation is here given. In Gurgdon they are locally called 
Malldhs or Thanterias, from their largest village, Thanteri : they are, 
however, found on the banks of the Jumna as far down as Agra and 
have three groups— the Bharbhunias, those who live by service as 
water-carriers, and the pilfering section who are called Thagaras. They 
appear to have three tribes— Sakkrawdl, J from Kdkota in Agra, Dewal 
and Nadma, in Gurgaon. The Dhinwar g-o^s are very numerous and

I The Jhinwars held musical reunions at which their well-known roars are sung. These 
aodrs describe Akbar's dealings with the Rajputs and their heroes' prowess. The song 
of Jaimaland Fatah is the most famous of these ivdrs.

The Jos of Barthog in Lahul frequently marry princesses of that family, 
a privilege bestowed on them because, when the Kullu Rajas attempted 
to wrench Lahul from Ladakh, they remained true to their allegiance. 
Like the Nonos of Spiti the Jos of Lahul cannot always find husbands 
for their own daughters, and so some of the minor Jo families havo 
begun to sell their girls to ordinary Kanet families in the Kullii 
valley, the climate of which is very trying in summer to ladies born 
and bred in Lahul. On the other hand, the Jos have begun to marry 
Kullu women. (2) a Jut sept without whose nominal leave the Mair

JoDHA, JoDAH, a JDogar clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. 

JoDHKA, JoDEA, a Rajput tribe of the Attock District, where it holds the 
south-east of Pindigheb tahsil, owning a little less than a third of its 
cultivated area and paying more than a third of its revenue. 

It is said to have come from Jammu or, according to another story, 
from Hindustan and to have held its present tract before the Gheba 
settled alongside of them. The Jodhras^ eponym was, they say, converted 
by Mahmud of Ghaxni, yet they still retain traces of Hindu customs 
iu their festivals and ceremonies. They appear to have come to the 
District about the end of the 16th century, and possessed themselves 
of the Soan and Sil ildqas which, with much of Tallagang tahsil. 
they ruled from Pindi Gheb.* They found Awans in possession of the 
soil and retained them as tenants. Malik Aulia Khan was the first 
Jodhra Malik of any importance "known to history. Under the 
Mughals he held Pindi Gheb, Tallagang and parts of Chakw^l and 
Fatehjang tahsils as revenue assignee and he probably it was who over- 
ran Tallagang. The Sikhs found the Jodhra power at its zenith, but it 
rapidly decayed owing to the secession of important branches of the 
tribe and the rise of the Ghebas. The tradition that the Gheba is really 
a branch of the Jodhra is supported by the fact that the town of Pindi 
Gheb is held by the Jodhra, not by the Gheba. Cracroft described 
them as " fine spirited fellows who delight in field sports, have horses 
and hawks, are often brawlers, and are ever ready to turn out and fight 
out their grievances, formerly with swords, and noAV with the more 
humble weapons of sticks and stones." The Maliks of Pindi Gheb are 
the leading Jodhra family. t 

JoDSi, see Jotsi. Jodsi is the form used in L^hul, where the jodsis or 
astrologers hold a little land rent-free, called onvo-zing, and could not 
apparently now be evicted, however ineflBcient. The heds or physicians 
hold man-zing land on a similar tenure. Cf. Hensi and Lobar. 

JoQi; fem. JoGiN.J — A devotee, a performer of jogr. The Yoga system of 
philosophy, as established by Patanjali, taught the means whereby the 
human soul might attain complete union with the Supreme Being. The 
modern Jogi, speaking generally, claims to have attained that union 
and to be, therefore, a part of the Supreme^ and, as such, invested with 
powers of control over the matei-ial universe. The history of the deve- 

* Settling originally on the north bank of the Sil the Jodhras founded Pindi Gheb, 
then called Dirahti. Later they moved their colony to the south bank of the Sil. Pindi 
Gheb was also named Pindi Malika-i-Shahryar and Pindi Malikai- Aulia, the village of the 
royal princess or queen of the saints, according to Raverty. 

t For a detailed account of the Jodhra families see the Attock Gazetteer, 1907, pp. 78-81. 

X Jogini is a female demon, created by Durgi, a witch or sorceress : see Piatt's s. v. The 
Yoginis or sorceresses of Hindu mythology may be of a modification of the Yakshinis or 
Dryads of Buddhist iconography.— Grtlnwedel, Buddhist Art in India, ^. \1\, The jogini 
is a sprite common in modern Punjab folklore, especially in the Plills. Thus in Kullu 
besides the devtas there are other beings who must from time to time be propitiated, but 
who do not generally possess temples. The woods and waterfalls and hill-tops are peopled 
by jognis, female spirits of a malignant nature, the gray moss which floats from the branches 
of firs and oaks in the higher forests is " the jognis" hair.'' The jogni of Chul, a peak of tho 
Ja^ri ridge, sends hail to destroy the crops if the people of the villages below fail on an 
appointed day to make a pilgrimage to the peak and sacrifice sheep. 

§ Pandit Hari Kishon Kaul dissents from this view and would say : — " Some of Ihe modern 
Jogis claim supernatural prowess, acquired by practising austerities or by black magic." 
The point of tlie observation in the text is that the practice of austerities or religious 
exercises confers, directly or indirectly, dominion over the material universe.

The term Jogi. 389 

lopment of the modern Jogi out of the ancient profcKsors of Yoga is as 
fascinating as it is obscure, but it would bo entirely beyond the f>copo 
of this article, the object of which is to give a mattcr-of-fuct account 
of the actual beliefs and customs of the latter-day Jogi. 

The term Jogi may be said to include two very distinct classes of 
persons. First are thu Jogis pi-opcr, a regular roligious order of 
Hindus, which includes both the Aughar Jogis and the Kanphatta Jogi 
ascetics who arc followers of Gorakh Nath and priests and wurshii)i)ers 
of Shiva.* These men are fully as respectable as the Bairagis, Gosiiins, 
and other religious orderp. They are all Hindus, but the gharbhti or 
secular Jogi, even if a Hindu, appears to be conmionly called Rawaj. 
and makes a living by begging, telling fortunes, singing and the like.t 
Another synonym for the Hindu Jogi is Nath. The second class is ihat 
miscellaneous assortment of low-caste faqirs and fortune-tellers, both 
Hindu and Musalmd,n but chietly Musalm^n, who are commonly known 
as Jogis. Every rascally beggar who pretends to be able to tell 
fortunes, or to practise astrological and necromantic arts in however 
small a degree, buys himself a drum and calls himself, and is called by 
others, a Jogi. These men include all the Musalmans, and probably 
a part of the Hindus of the eastern districts, who style themselves Jogis. 
They are a thoroughly vagabond set, and wander about the country 
beating a drum and begging, practising surgery and physic in a small 
way, writing charms, telling fortunes, and practising exorcism and 
divination ; or, settling in the villages, eke out their earnings from 
these occupations by the offerings made at the local shrines of the 
malevolent godlings or of the Sayads and other Musalman saints; for 
the Jogi is so impure that he will eat the offerings made at any shrine. 
These people, or at least the Musalman section of them, are called in 
the centi'O of the Punjab Rawals, or sometimes Jogi-Rawals, from the 
Arabic rammdl, a diviner, which again is derived from ramal, "sand," 
with which the Arab magicians divine.+ The Jc-gi-Rnwals of Kathiawar 
are said to be exercisers of evil spirits, and to worship a deity called 
Korial. In Sidlkot the Jogis pretend to avert storms from the ripening 
crops by plunging a drawn sword into tlie field or a knife into a mound, 
sacrificing goats, and accepting suitable offerings. Mr. Benton wrote: — 
'* The Jogi is a favourite character in Hindustani fiction. He there 
appears as a jolly playful character of a simple disposition, who enjoys 
the fullest liberty and conducts himself in the most eccentric fashion 
under the cloak of religion without being called in (|ueslion," The 
Jogis used to be at deadly feud with the yaniusis and 5U0 of the former 
were once defeated by two or three hundred tSaniasis. Akbar wit- 
nessed the fight and sent soldiers smeared with ashes to assist the 
vSaniasis who at length defeated the Jogis. § 

* It might be more correct to say Bhairava, not Shiva. 

I This was Sir Denzil Ibbctson's view, but the Gharishti or Grihasti Jogi is now accurately 
tlescribcd as distinct from the Jogi Riuval. The latter may be by origin a Jogi, but he is 
a degenerate arid has now no connection with the Jogis projjcrly so called. 

X The derivation of R4wal from niindl aijpears {]uite untenable. The word Kawal is used 
as a title in iiajpulana. It means ' lord ' or ' ruler ' and is thus merely a synonym of 
fidtli, but appears to be specially allectcd by Jogis of the Nag-nathia iiunih, see ('»'/»■«, p. 'itiu. 

§ E. U. I., V, p. 318. 



390 Jogi origins. 

Tlic Jogis as a body cannot be said to have any history j so numerous 
and indotorminatu are the branches into which they have split up in the 
course of time. Regarding their origins the Jogis have a vast body of 
nebulous tradition, the drbris of much primitive metaphysical specula- 
tion now hardly recognisable in its fantastic garb. 

The origin of the Jogis. 
According to the Tahqiqdt-i-Chiahti, a devotee of Shiva desired off- 
spring, so the god, at Parbati's intercession, gave him some ashes from his 
dhiini or fire and told him his wife should eat them. The wife, however, 
was incredulous and did not do so, but let the ashes fall on a heap of 
cowdang. Eventually the devotee found a child where the ashes had 
been thrown, and took it to Shiva^ who said it would grow up a great 
ascetic and should be given to him.* He named it GorakhNath, from the 
place of his birth and instructed him to find a Guru. As Shiva could find 
no one worthy, Gorakh Nath set forth to seek a teacher, and reaching 
the sea, offered there a large loaf on a pqial leaf. This was swallowed 
by Rakho, the fish, who 12 years later restored not the loaf, but a child 
whom Shiva named Machhendra N^th and who became Gorakh Ndth's 
Guru. Another version makes Machhendra Nath the issue of Gorakh 
Nath himself. 

Shiva then told Gorakh Nath that he must, though an ascetic, have 
children, and advised him to make disciples. Shiva also gave him duhh 
, grass, saying it should be their clothing, and a stick cut from an ak tree, 
saying it should be tied to his garments, and used as a ndd, to be sounded 
thrice daily, in the morning, in the evening, and before the Guru. He 
also asked Parbati to bore Gorakh Nd,th's ears and place earthen ear- 
rings in them. This she did and also mutilated herself, dyeing a cloth 
with the blood and giving it to Gorakh Ndth to wear. Gorakh Nd,th 
then made twelve disciples : — 

5. Bah-^gNath. 9. Gangai Nath. 

6. Darya Nath 1(>. Dhajja Nath. 

7. KaikNath. H. Jalandhar Nath.t 

8. NagN4th.t 12. Nfm Nath.§ 

A tradition says that Narinjan Nirankd,r, the formless Creator, 
created Gorakh N^th from the sweat of his breast, whence he is also 
called Ghor Nath (fr. ghor, filth) . The Supreme then bade him create 
the universe, whereupon a creeping plant sprang from his navel, and a 
lotus blossomed on it. From this flower sprang Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva 
and Shakti, the last a woman who straightway dived beneath the 
waters, before earth or sky, air or fire had been created. As Earth was 
indispensable to the complete manifestation of the universe, the Supreme 
sent Vishnu down to the lower regions beneath the waters to bring 
pjarth to the surface. When he reached the Patal Lok Vishnu saw 
Shakti with a dhuni in front of her, while light rayed from her body.

* An instance of a child being devoted to the god from birth. This legend is doubtless 
of quite recent origin, made up by ignorant Jogis out of fragments from the Purdnas. No 
classical authority is or could be quoted for what follows. It is pure folklore, possibly 
ancient but probaljly modern.

Jogi myths. 391 

A Voice asked who had como, and Vishnu replied that his errand was 
to bring up Earth by the Supreme's command. The Shakti answered 
that he could do so, provided he 6rst wed her, but Vishnu urged that 
intercourse with her was impossible, sinco even at a distance of 12 hos he 
found her effulgence insupportable. So he returned unsuccessful. 
Brahma likewise failed, and so at last Shiva was sent. To his reply that 
* Shiva had come,' the Voice said : 'There have been croresof Shivae, 
which Shiva art thou ?' Shiva answered that he was the Lord of Kailds, 
and he agreed to espouse Shakti when Earth and Sky had come into 
being. Shakti thon gave forth the four Vedas, and bestowed two 
handfuls of ashes with some smoke from her ' dimni upon Shiva, who 
carried them up. The smoke when sent upwards became the sky, and 
the ashes when strewn upon the waters formed land. Hence the Jogis 
worship only Gorakh Nath and Shiva. By a process which reminds us 
of the myth of Hephaistos and Athene,"^" Gorakh Ndth became by a fish 
the father of Machhondra Ndth, who forthwith went into the wastes to 
worship. When Gorakh Nfith was reproached with his incontinence he 
felt that he must seek out a gurii of his own, but finding none better 
than himself, he bethought him that his own son was fitted for the 
office and exclaimed : — 

Barte khasm, niJcalte puta, 
Yun Ihdkhe Gorakh abhdiitd. 

" ' The husband's embraces cause sons to be born ' : Thus saith the 
ascetic Gorakh." 

He then sought out Machhendra Ndth, who would have fallen at his 
feet, but Gorakh addressed him as his own guru. This is how 
Machhendra Nsith became Gorakh's guru as well as his son. 

The Brah mans tell quite a different tale: Bhasmasurj a rdkshasa, 
had long served Shiva, who in return promised him any boon he might 
claim, 80 he demanded that which when placed on anything would 
reduce it to -ashes. Shiva thereupon gave him his bangle. Bhasmasur 
coveted Piirbati, Shiva's wife, and he endeavoured to place the bano-le 
on her husband's head. Shiva fled, pursued by the demon, and at last 
hid in a cave on Kailds and blocked up its entrance with a stone. Bhaawfin 
now assumed Purbati's form and approached Bhasmasur, but when- 
ever he tried to grasp the vision it eluded his embrace, and at last 
declared that Shiva used to sing and dance before his wife. Bhasmasur 
avowed his readiness to learn and while he was dancing as she tauo-ht 
him she bade him place his hand on his head. In it he held the 
bangle, and was burnt to ashes. Bhagwan then brought Shiva 
who was afraid to show himself, cut of the cave. Shiva's curiosity 
was now aroused and he demanded that Bhagwdn should again assume 
the form which had enchanted Bhasmasur. This was Mohni, Pdrbati's 
double, but even more beauteous than she, and when her shape appeared 
Shiva by a process similar to that alluded to above became the father 
of Hanumfin, who was born of Anjani's ear, and of Machhendra 
Nath. By a cow he also fathered Gorakh Nd,th. 

Once, says another legend, the sage Bashisht recounted the follow- 
ing story to Sri Rdm Chandraji : — "My mind was ill at ease, and I

wandered until I came to Bindra Chal, on wbicli hill I spent a long 
period in worship. One day I saw the wife of Brahma, my father, 
coming towards me. She approached and said my father was wroth 
with her and I resolved to go to him, so I went and found a cave 
whose mouth was blocked by a stone. Unable to move it I created a 
man by my Brahm-tej (creative power) and ho removed the stone. 
I then entered the cave, wherein I saw a world, like the one in which 
I lived. In it were all the gods, and I first made a reverence (parndm) 
to Brahma and then to all the other gods. But when I told them 
of my errand they warned mo to quit the cave at once, since the 
day of judgment was at hand because wives were dissatisfied with 
their husbands. I did as they had bidden me, but meanwhile stillness 
had prevailed everywhere, and all the earth had turned to water. 
Soon a great sound arose from the waters, and endured for a long 
while, but when it had nearly died away Shakti appeared. I 
endeavoured to approach her, but could not even do obeisance, and 
stood like a statue before her. She then cast a ball into the 
waters, and it made a great sound. As it died away she again appear- 
ed. Thrice she did this, and the third time Yishnu appeared. 
Him she bade to wed her, but he refused and again she threw a ball 
upon the waters. Then Brahma emerged, but he too declined her 
hand, and again she cast a ball. Shiva then appeared in wrathful 
mood, and he promised to espouse her, but not yet. Though all 
these cods were free from mdyd, nevertheless through it they had 
appeared, and each claimed superiority over the others. Meanwhile 
a lotus blossomed on the surface of the waters, and they agreed that 
he who should trace it to its root should be deemed the chief. 
Neither "Vishnu nor Brahma succeeded in his attempt, but Shiva, 
leavino- his body, transformed himself into an insect and descended 
throuo-h the stem of the lotus. But his rivals besought Shakti to 
transfio'ure his body, so as to puzzle him on his return, and so she 
took some dirt off her body and of it made earrings (kundal). 
These she placed in the ears of Shiva's form, boring holes in them, 
and thus re-animated the body. When it stood up she demanded 
fulfilment of Shiva's promise, but his form refused to wed her, 
so in her wrath she threatened to burn it. The body, however, 
replied that her earrings had made him immortal. Subsequently the 
earrino-s were changed into miindras, as will be told later on. The 
Shakti then asked whose body it was, and it replied that it was 
Bhoo-u-rikh, whereby Jogis mean one who is immortal and has control 
over his senses. Hence Shiva is also called Bhogu-rikh. 

Meanwhile Shiva returned, having braced the lotus to its root. 
Failino- to find his own form he made for himself a new body''^ and 
in that married Shakti. The descendants of the pair were called 
Rudargan, those of Bhogu-rikh being nnmed Jogijan. But Shiva's 
progeny inherited his fierce temper, and eventually exterminated 
the descendants of Bhogu-rikh, who told Shiva that he, as a jogi, 
was free from joy or sorrow and was unconcerned at the quarrel 
between their children. But Shiva replied : ' Thou art free from 
mdyd, yet dost owe thy existence to it. Do thy work, I will not

interfere.' So Bhogu-rikh began his task under Shiva's counsel. 
Initiated by him he became known as Dde Ndth Pdrbati^ and founded 
the Jogi^Jan^/i or 'door/ (Bashisht's tale would teem to end here).

After his initiation by Shiva Ude Nath made Rndargan a jogi 
and ho by his spiritual poAver, initiated an tu'il spirit (dait) named 
Jfllandhar, bringing him to the right way. He, in turn, made two 
disciples, Machhendra Ndth and Jallandaripa. The latter founded 
the Pa 'panth ; while Machhendra Ndth made Gorakh Nilth liis 
disciple. And here we must tell the story of Machhendra Ndth's 
birth. 

In the Satyug lived a R^ja, Udho-dhar, who was exceedingly piuns. 
On his death his body was burnt, but his navel did not burn and the 
unburnt part was cast into a river, where a fish devoured 
it and gave birth to Machhendra NAthf — from machhi, ' fish.' By 
reason of his good deeds in a previous life he became a saint. Gorakh 
Ndth was born of dung, and when Machhendra Ndtli found him ha 
made him his disciple, and theu left him to continue his wanderino-;^. 
At length Machhendrii Niith reached Sangaldip where he became ji

X Grihisht ashram. In other words he relapsed and abandoned the spiritual life. This 
appears more clearly in the following variant of the legend -.—After making Gorakh his 
disciple Machhendra went oil to Knmnip— not to Sangaldip— and there he found the 
country governed by two Ennis, who with magic aids chose themselves husbands. When 
Machhendra arrived he too fell into their toils and lost his reason, so the llanfs weJded 
him and posted watchmen to prevent any mendicants entering the kingdom to effect his 
rescue. Gopi Chand. however, succeeds in evading them, as will be described later. 

§ The variant makes Gopi Chand sister's son of Bhartari, and his mother tries to make 
him a disciple of Jalandhar Niith, but iastead he casts that saint into a well. 



394 Jogi legends. 

taught yog by his mother, and desiring to becone a jopi sought out 
Jallandaiipa, who taught him a certain maxim [shabd). Unable to 
understand this, he consulted his minister who falsely told him that 
its teaching was contrary to the Vedas and true religion, fearing that 
if he disclosed its real import, the Rd/ja would abandon his kingdom 
and retire from the woi'ld. Hearing this false interpretation Gopi 
Chand had Jallandaripa cast into a well, into which he ordered horse- 
dung to be thrown daily. There he remained, until Gorakh Ndth, 
resolved on his rescue, reached Ujjain. The seat of Jallandaripd at 
Ujjain was then occupied by Kanipa. the mahant. Gorakh Ndth chose 
a lonely spot for his bathing- place and thither, according to Jogi 
usage, food was sent him from the kitchen of the monastery by the 
hands of a inan who was not himself a Jogi. When this messenger, 
bearing food for one, reached Gorakh N^th he found tivo persons: 
when he took food for two, he found four, and so on. Hearing this 
Kanipa guessei^ it must be Gorakh, so he sent him a taunting message, 
saying : ' Thy gurii is but a worldling, and thou canst not free him.' 
But Gorakh retorted that Kanipa ought to be ashamed to let his guru 
remain so buried in the well. Upon this Kanipa, with the Raja's 
leave, began to clear the well, but Gorakh declared that the horse- 
dung should ever increase, and left for Sangaldip.* 

On arriving there, however, he found that the Rd,ja had posted men 
to turn back any jogi trying to enter his kingdom, so he turned 
himself into a fly, and thus succeeded in entering the Rdjd,'s court. 
There he caused all the instruments and the very walls to chant, 
' Awake, Machhendra, Gorakh Nilth has come.* The Raja bade hira 
show himself, and he appeared before him among the musicians. 

(There is clearly a gap in the recorded legend here.t It continues : — ) 
The RAja's queen died, and, after her death, Gorakh asked Machhendra 
to come away with him. On the way, after a repulsive incident, 
Gorakh killed Machhendra's two sons and placed their skins on a 
tree. When Machhendra asked where the boys were, Gorakh 
showed him their skins, and then to comfort him restored them to life. 
Further on their road they were sent to beg in a village, where a man 
bade them drag away a dead calf, before he would give them alms. 
They did so and in return he gave them food, but when they reached 
Machhendra and Gorakh again they found it had turned to blood and 
worms. So Machhendra cursed the village^ and when the people 

* Kamrup in the variant. On the road he meets a troupe of actors (rdsdhdris) on their 
■way to Kamr.iip, and is engaged by them as a servant. Bidden to carry all their stage 
propel ties he bears the whole burden by his spiritual power. On their arrival the 
rus'i/idn's perform before Machhendra but not one of them was able to play on the tahla, 
as Gorakh held it spell-bound, and they had to get him to play it. As soon as it began to 
play, it rang ' Awake ! Machhendra ! ' Rasdharis are found in Lahore and Amritsar and 
the adjoining Districts They are said to be called hhagats. like worshippers of the Devi. 

t The variant too is silent on this episode. It makes the two Ranfs transform them- 
selves into kites and pursued them for a while, oft compelling them to stop, but at last they 
escaped from Kamrup. As soon as they had got out of the country they hailed by a well, 
into which Gorakh threw four gold bricks and as many gold coins, which Machhendra had 
brought from Kamrup, and this so enraged the latter that he refused to go further. So 
Gorakh turned the water into gold, but Machhendra thinking this would cause disputes 
among the worldly, begged hira to block up the well. Gorakh then turned the gold into 
crystal, the first ever created.

asked him to visit them he promised to do so in the Kaljiig (Iron 
Age).* P^ras Nath and Nim Nath then separated, and each founded 
a new panth, the Piij and the Sartora, with which other jogri* have no 
conceJD. Gorakh and Machhendra now reached IJjjaii), aud found Jal- 
landaripa still buried in the well. With Kanipa they ix'scued him, 
turning all the horse-dung into locusts wiiich flew away, and, when only 
a little was left, forming a human body with a blanket and infusing life 
into it : this man they bade bring the Nath out of the dung.i' The man 
asked him to come out and give him bread, but tlio fiawd. (saint 
Jallandaripa) asked who he was. He replied ' Goj)i Chand,' and the 
saint thereupon burnt him to ashes seven times. But at the eighth 
time Gorakh asked Raja Gopi Chand to go himself to the saint. 
Jallandaripa then consented to come out, and declared that since he 
had not been consumed by fire, he should bpccme immortal, and this 
is why Gcpi Chand never dies. J He was also made a Jogi by Kanipa, 
with the saint's permission, and assumed the name of Sidh Sanskaripa, 
one of the 84 sidhs. The Jogis of this imnth are called spddhd, as 
they keep snakes. They are generally found in Bengal. One of them 
initiated Ismail, aMuhammadan into tho j^antJi, and he founded a new 
panth like that of Sidh Sanskaripd,.^ 

Gorakh and Machhendra now left Ujjain and came towards the 
Jhelum. There they took up their abode on the hill of Tilla. Here 
they initiated the following as Jogis : — (i) Kapal Muniji, Avho in turn 
had two chelas, one Ajai-pdl, who founded the Kapalanf panth ; the 
other Ganga Nath who established tho panth called after his own 
name II : {ii) Kharkai and Bhuskai, each of whom founded a panth : 
[Hi) Shakar N^th. The last named in his wanderings reached a land 
where a Mlechh (low caste) Edj^ bore sway. By him the Jogi was 
seized and promised his liberty only if ho would cause it to rain 
pugar, otherwise he would be put to the torture. But he induced the 
Rd,ja to promise to become his servant if he performed this miracle. 
He succeeded, and then seizing the Ra]?! buried him in the ground. 
Twelve years later he returned, and found the R^jii a skeleton, but he 
restored him to life and made him his disciple and cook. Nevertheles.*^ 
the KtijfVs disposition was unchanged, and one day he took out some 
of the pulse he was cooking and tasted it.^ Bhairon chanced that 
day to appear in person,** but he refused the proffered food and tho 



* In the variant this episode is different : Gorakh goes with the boys to beg alms at a 
bdnm's (merchant's) house, and they are ma:lo to take away the dead calf. When Gorakh 
sees their food transformed he catches them by the hand, takes them to tho hdnias house 
and there murders them. Thereupon all the Banias complain that he has polluted their 
jag (sacrifice) by this murder, and he retorts that they had polluted his chelas, but he a^rrees 
to restore them to life if tho bdnias will henceforth worship him and no other. 
They assented, and this is why Gorakh left Paras Nath, one of the two boys, with the 
Banias, among whom the Jains deem him an incarnation of God, 

\ In the variant Gorakh makes seven bundles of grass, each of which says : "I am Gopi 
Chand," in reply to Jalandhar Nath, and is burnt to ashes at his command. 

X In the variant the slabs of the Avell were turned into kites, and the horse-dung into 
locusts and so they were created. 

§ So Gopi Chand also founded a jpanth, that called after his second name, tis., Sidh 
Sanskaripa. See also infra p. 407. 

!J A Jogi of this panful in turn founded the Kajan or Kayan-nathi panth, found in th* 
ancient town of Bhera on the Jhelum. This must be the Kaya-Nathi panth.

ex-'Raji/a villainy was detected. As a punishment a hdndi or Earthen 
pot was hung round his neck and he was condemned to wander the 
livelong day getting his food out of the pot. Hi:* punishment lasted 
four years, and he was then pardoned, but his disciples were called 
H^ndi-pharang and the 'panth still bears that name : [iv) Another 
initiate was Sant Niith, whose disciple Dharm Nath founded the 
Dharni-n^thi paJ2</>, which now has its head gaddl on the God^wari, 
having repUced the llamke panth there : {v) The next initiate, 
Santokh Nath, made oneRiim Nath his chela, and he founded the 
Ram-ke panih which, replaced on the Godawari by the Dharm-ndthi, 
now has its chief gaddi at Delhi: [vi) Lachhraan Nath succeeded 
Gorakh at Tilla, and his panth. is styled Darbdri Tilla Bal Gondai. 
Subsequently was born a Jogi who founded a panth called the Sunehri 
Tills, a famous order : {vii) Arjan Nanga, whose seat is near 
Jwalamukhi, founded the Man Manthi pnnth, or ecstatics, now settled 
at B'har. If a,faq>r goes to the mahant of this fanth be is given 
a hoe and some cord and told to go and cut grass. A long time ago 
one Sant Nath mahdtmd of the Uharm-nathis went to this wahant 
and was bidden to cut grass like any one else. So he asked whether 
he was to cut the grass from below or from above. He was told by 
a viahdtmi that he should so cut it that it would grow again. 
Accordingly ever since then when a chela is initiated into this ecstatic 
panth a gjD'u dies. Sant Nd,thjf's panth is called the Bawdji kd panth. 
He had many chelas, of whom two deserve mention. These were 
Ranbudh and Mahnidata. Once as the Bawd, wandered north his 
cameh^ were stolen and when he told the people of that part that he 
■was their pir or spiritual guide, they replied that he must eat with 
them. When the meal was ready he bade these two disciples eat with 
the people, promising them immortality, but forbidding them to found 
any more new j)a?if/i.9. So they did not do so, and are called NdrUgds, 
and to this day two persons always remain in attendance at their 
tombs. 

One account says that Sharang or Shring Nath, who attained to the 
zenith of spiritual power after Gorakh Nath's death, introduced new 
rules of his own and bade his followers bore their ears and wear the 
mundra of wood. After his death the following sects or orders were 
formed — (1) the Gin Nath, who marry and indulge in such luxuries as 
drinking, (2) the Purinama, some of whom are secular and eat 
meat, (y) the Saniasis, (4) the militant Nd^ngns, (5) the Ajaipdl 
whose founder was ruler of A j mere and a profound believer in the ear- 
pierced Jogis. His followers are said to have once ruled India. (G) 
the Gwd,li-basda, (7) the Ismdil Jogis— one follower of Ismail was 
Nona Chamari, a famous professor of the black art ; (8) Agam Nath, 
(9) Nim Nath, and (10) Jalandhar Ndth. 

The mythology of Qorahh. 

The nine Naths and the 84 Sidhs always follow Gorakh in his 
wanderings, and the route can be traced by the small trees bearing 
sugarcandy which spring up wherever they go. It is related in the 
Bhagvat that Raja Sambhii Manu once ruled iu Oudh over the whole 
world. When the four mid-born sons of Brdhma refused to beget off-

Bharat with eight of his brothers ruled the 9 divisions [khandds) of 
the world : 81 became ascetics and Brahma ns, and 9 became the Ndths 
or perfected Jogis, whose names arc given below. 

The Naths are always said to be nine in numbei', in contradistinction 
to the jKUitlis which are, ideally, twelve. Their names and titles are 
variously given ; — 



Aungkar Adi-nath (Lord of Lords), 
Shiva, 

Shcl-nith (Lord of the Arrow-shaft) : 
variously said to bo Krishna or Ram 
<'hai;dra. 

Santokh-nath (Lord of Gratification).

Hanuman or Lakshraana.

Eleplant's Strength and Neck) : Ganc?&

u. Praj-nnth, or Udai'-nath (Lord of the 
People): said to be Parvati. 

7. Mayariipi Machhendra-nath (the ivon- 

drous Form) : guru of Gorakh. 

8. Gathepinde Eichayakari or Naranthar : 
Shambiijaiti Guru Gorakh-nith. 



9. Gyansarupe (or Purakh) Siddh Chuurauju-e-ndth, or Piaran Ihagat.'f 

Gorakh plays a leading part in the legend of Guga, and naturally 
therefore Jogis, both Hindu and Muhammadan, take offerings made 
to him, giving but a small share to the Chuhras ; and also carry his 
flag, chhari, of peacock's feathers, from house to house in Bhadon.J 

The 8idhs, more correctly Siddlis, are pro])eriy speaking saints of 
exceptional purity of life who have attained to a semi-divine existence, 
but who in the eyes of the vulgar are perhaps little more than demons 
who obtained power from Gorakh. They are especially worshipped in 
I ho low hiHs,§ e. g. in Ambala and Hoshiarpur, in the form of stones, etc., 
and under various names. The distinctive emblem of their cult appears 
to be the singi, a cylindrical ornament worn on a thread round the 
neck. Ghazidas is a Siddh of some repute near Una : Chanu is said to 
have been a Chamar, and people of that caste feast on goat's flesh and 
sing on certain dates to his memory. Another Siddh is the jafhera, or 
ancestor, Kfila Fir, who is worshipped in the low hills and throughout the 
eastern Districts generally and more particularly, as Kala Mahar, by the 
Sindhu Jdts as their forebear. His shrine is at Mahar in Samrala but 
the Sindhus of Khot in Jind have there set up a shrine with bricks from 
the original tomb and there they, and the Khdtis and Lobars too,

worship him. His shrine usually takes the form of a mud-pillar under 
a tree or by a pond^ and images of him are worn in silver plates as 
charms. His .samddit at Kliot is in charge of the Ai-panth Jogis. 

The tmindra. — How the hundal was turned iuto a mundra is 
explained in the following story : — When Bhartari was made a Jogi 
he was put to a severe tost. Jallandarip^ was his guru, but he was 
also a sddiq or pupil of Gorakh, and his chief companions were of 
the KapMni panth, whence he was known as Bhartari Kapl^ni and 
reckoned one of the 84 sldhs. One day he said to Jallandaripd, : 
" Thou hast put nie to a severe test, but henceforth the faqirs of this 
panth will be mostly men of the world for they will mingle with such 
men." Gorakli said that he would be the more pleased with them, and 
Bhartari asked for some mark to be given them to distinguish them 
from worldly people. Accordingly a hole three inches wide was made 
in the Jogi's ears, and clay mundras were inserted in them. Sub- 
sequently the mundras wei'e made of wood, then of crystal gilt, then 
of ivory. By wearing the mundras, a Jogi becomes immortal, as 
Bhogu-rikh had told Shakti. When this practice was permitted, two 
sidhs Kharkai and Bhuskai began to bore each Jogi's ears, with 
Gorakh's assent. The latter with these two sidhs and several other 
Jogis settled at a place on the road to HingMj in Balochist^n, a place 
which every Jogi of this panth must visit if he wishes to be considered 
a perfect sddhu and attain yoga. Since then it has been usual to bore 
a Jogi's ears, but once when the two sidhs tried to bore the ears of a 
Jogi who had visited that place they found that they healed as fast 
as they bored holes in them, so they gave up the attempt, and Gorakh 
exclaimed that the pilgrim was ' Aughar.' Thenceforth Aughars 
do not have their ears bored and form a body distinct from the other 
Jogis. 

Jogi Nature-vjorship. 

The Jogis claim, inter alia, povser to transmute any metal into gold 
or silver. In the time of Altamsh, says one legend, a Jogi named 
Dina Nath begged a boy sitting in a shop with a heap of copper coin to 
give him a few pieces. The boy said the money was not his, but his 
lather's, and he gave the Jogi food. The Jogi prayed to Vishnu for 
power 10 reward the boy. Then he melted down the copper and 
turned the mass into gold by means of charms and a powder. Altamsh 
heard of the occurrence and witnessed the Jogi's powers, but the latter 
declined to accept any of the gold he had made, so it was sent to the 
mint and coined, with his name as well as that of Altamsh upon it. 
Jogis allege that these * Dinanathi ' gold mohars arc still to be found. 
/^ Similarly the Jogis claim power over hailstorms, and in .Sialkot the 
rathhana^ is a Jogi who can check a hailstorm or divert it into 
waste land. 

The connection between Jogis and snake-worship is naturally a 
close one. In some places Jogis are said to eat snakes — a kind of 
ritualistic cannibalism — and the snake is often styled jogi, just as the 
parrot is designated * pan4it.^t 

*tr.rath, 'hail,' and bona, ' otie who Imptisons or checks.' This practice is alluded 
to in Prinsep's Sidlkot Settlemerit Rep., p. 37.

Jogi rites. 899 

The cults of the Jogis contain strong elements of nature-worship 
which finds expression in tlie names assumed by them after initiation. 
Such are Nim-n^th,* Kanak-n^th (wheat), Ndg-nath (snake), Tota-o^th 
(parrot). 

The Jogis hold everything made of earth in great respect, whence 
the saying : — Mitti kd dsan, milti kd hdsan, mitti kd sarhdna, mitti kd 
bdna. — ^ The earthen dsa?^ (carpet), the earthen pitcher, the earthen 
pillow and the earthen woof.' 

The Jogi Janeo. 

The Jogis generally wear a janeo of black wool, which is made ly 
certain members of the order, not by any member, nor by a Brahman. 
It is 9 cubits long, made of 3 strands each, woven of 8 threads on a 
bobbin, and jilaited into a bobbin-thread, like an English braid neck- 
lace,! Round the waist Jogis wear a similar thread of 2 eoparale 
bobbin-threads of 8 strands each, twisted together, with a loop at 
one end and a button at the other. 

The Kanphatta should be branded at Kalesar near Dwdrkd with two 
concentric circles within a third incomplete one, both ends of which are 
finished off by a circular bt^nd in the arm. J 

The rudrakisha^ with two facets is sacred to Shiva, and can only be 
worn by the Jogi who has his wife with him : One with 5 facets is 
devoted to Hanumdn ; and one with 11 is highly prized, being sacred to 
Gauri Shankar and worn by celibate Jogis. 

The Jogi funeral rites. 

A dying Jogi is made to sit cross-legged. After death the corpse is 
washed by the deceased's fellow-Jogis, a langoti tied round its waist 
and ashes smeared over it. A coflSn is then made, if means permit, 
but a poor Jogi is simply wrapped in a blanket and carried by two 
men on two poles, and the body thrown into a river. A wealthy Jogi 
is, however, placed on a wooden chaiiki shaped like a palanquin, and 
upon this flowers are cast. The procession to the grave is called 
sawdri and is headed by horses and bands playing music. The grave 
is made deep, with a spacious niche like that in Muhammadan graves, 
and the body placed in it cross-legged and facing the north^. The 
Jogi's hairdgan is placed before him, with a gourd full of Water on 
his right, a loin-cloth, a kanak or staff of Mahadeo, a loaf of wheaten 
flour, and two earthen plates, one full of water, the other of rice and 
milk. An earthen potsherd is also placed on his head. Then a mound

but animal-names appear to be also adopted.

become householders. They ^iuh the dead, and for every corpse get 4 annas in money, 
together with a plate of brass or Aon. s/ and a woollen or cotton cloth. They alsoj get some 
grain at each harvest. They are considered defiled as they take ofleringi made at death, 
and the Kanets and higher castes will not drink with them.

is raised overtlie orrave/ and all the Jogis wash their hands with water 
supplied by the deceased's disciples. They then bathe and the dis- 
ciples give them sweets. On the third day they are also fed [churma 
alone being given if the disciples are poor). Later on the shrddh i'*, 
if possible, performed thus : — Jogis are invited and keep a vigil all 
night. About a pahr before dawn they are fed with fish, or pakauras 
(vegetables coated with haisan or paste of powdered gram fried in 
mustard oil), or khir, i. e. rice boiled in milk, gram and ghungnidn, or 
pildo, or rice, wine, flesh, fruit, etc. Seven thrones or gaddis are now 
erected to : {i) the Pir, (u) Jognis, (m) Sakhya or witness, [iv) Bir, 
{v) the Bhanddri of Guru Gorakh Ndth, [vi) Guru Gorakh Ndth, and 
{vii) to Neka. Mantras are then repeated, and clothes: gold, silver and 
copper : a cow and earth given away in charity. The wake is now 
attended only by Jogis but formerly men of all claasea, even Muham- 
madans, used to take part in it. Lastly, after all these ceremonies, a 
council ipindhdra] of Jogis is held, and one of the deceased's disciples 
is elected Guru or Bir Mahant, three kinds of food, piiri, kachauri and 
pildo being distributed. The deceased's clothes and the coffin are 
given to the Icotwdls, or bankias, or else to Jangam/agiVs. As the Jogi 
is not biirnt his bones cannot be sent to the Ganges, so his nails are 
removed and taken to Hardw^r. The saniddh of a Jogi may be of 
earth or brick, and belpattar (leaves) are strewn over it. On it a lamp 
is also kept burning for 10 days, flowers and water being placed near 
it and a conch being blown. Rice balls are given in the name of the 
deceased for 10 days as among other Hindus. On the 10th day clothes 
are washed and on the 1 3th kirya karam ceremony is performed. The 
ceremonies are the same as among Hindus. 

The following story is told to account for the fact that Jogis bury 
their dead : In Gorakh's time there arose a dispute between the 
Hindus and the Muhammadans, the latter saying they were masters 
of the earth and of all the living and the dead. Gorakh sat on the 
o-round, placing all his food, etc., by his side, and bade the earth yield 
to him, if he too had a share in it. It opened and Gorakh sank into it, 
and so Jogis usually bury their dead. 

Initiation, 

In theory any Hindu can become a Jogi, but in practice only those of 
the twice-born castes are admitted into the order. In theory caste is 
abandoned upon entering it, and as marriage is, in theory, forbidden, 
no question as to caste can arise in connection with it. But as mar- 
riage is in practice tolerated the original caste is preserved in practice 
for matrimonial purposes, though in theory all Jogis are caste-less. 
Further, there is a tendency to avoid marriage in the same panth, 
as all the members of a panth are in theory spiritually akin. 
Within the order there is in theory equality and no restrictions are 
placed upon eating, drinking or smoking together, but even a Hindu 
of high caste who joins the panth of Jdlandhar Ndth is excluded by 
other panths. Moreover, the theoretical equality does not extend to 
the women, as the Jog:i does not allow his women-folk to eat with him. 
Women of every panth may, however, eat together. 

* Over the grave an earthen potsherd is also placed on a three-legged stool. 



Jogi initiation . 401 

A would-be disciple is dissuaded frotn bpcorairif^a Josi, the hardships 
of the life being impressed upon liira. If he persists lie i^ made to fast 
for two or three days. After this, a knite is driven into tlie earth and 
the novice is made to swear by it — 

(r) not to engSKe in trade ; 
(ii) not to take employment ; 
(«iO not to keep dangerouH weapons ; 
(i'y) not to become angry when abused ; and 

(v) not to marry. 

He is also required to protect his ears, for a Jogi whose ears were 
cut used to be buried alive, but is now only excommunicated. After 
this probation his ears are bored by a giiril, or an adf-pt, who is entitled 
to He. 1-4 as an offering which may or may not be accepted. 

Up to a certain point the Jogi initiatory rites resemble those of the 
Saniclsis. The c/io^i of the novice is removed by the guriL: the janeo 
is also removed : and he is given saffrou-coloured clothes to wear. Of 
these the hafni is worn c-ompulsorily. The gurn-mantar is tlien com- 
municated, eecretly. After this the Jogis of ' a certain sect ' pierce the 
chela's ears, and insert the kundal or earring, and the chela, hitherto 
an atighar* now becomes a ndth, certain set phrases (not mantras) 
being recited. According to Macauliffe Jogis smear ashes on their naked 
bod'es as clotliing or a protection against the e]ements,t but the ashes 
»ppear to s-ymbclize their death to the world, like the kajni. 

We may thus safely distinguish three stages in a Jogi's initiation. 
At first he is a chela (pupil or candidate), then an aughar or novice,^ 
and finally a darshani, vulg. kanphafta,^ (or 'split-eared'). An 
Aughar is not entitled to all the privileges of the sect, e. g., at a feast he 
only receives half the portion of a Kanphatta. A Jogi who is fully 
initiated certainly loses all rights of inheritance in his natural family, 
but it is doubtful whether an Aughar would do so. It is also not clear 
wheth^^r initiation involves the loss of property already vested in the 
initiate, but presumably it would do so, 

* According to this account auqhnr simply means ' novice.' Nath is a title acquired by 
the fully iiiitidte. An account of the Jogis of Katn Nath says that the candidate is given 
a razor and si-issors seven times by his gum. wlio deters him from entering tue Jugi order, 
but if he perseveres the ^'o-it cuts off a tuft of his hair and he is then shaved by a 
barber. Then he is made to bathe and be?meared with ashes, a fc-iyiu' or shroud, a it;i(/(-a' 
and a cap being given to him. The ashes and ta/(ii clearly signify his death to the world. 
After six months' probation his ears are pierced and earthen rings inserted in them 

t Sihh Religion, VI. p. 243. 

X It is indeed said that an aughar can become a Sanifisi, an Udasi, a Bairagi, a 
Suthrashiihi, etc., etc , as well as a Jogi or a Jangam. On the other hand, some accounts 
represent the A ughars as a distinct order, followers of Kanipa Nath and, J^landhar Nath, 
while the Kanphattas are followers of Gorakh and Machhendra *.in other words, the more 
perfect -Togis) : or again they are connected with two schools of the Patanjali jihilosophy ; 
while a third account splits up the Jogis into Shiv worshippers and Serpent worshippers. 

§ Jogis themselves do not use the word Kanphatta. It is a popular term. So too in 
common parlance Jogfs are distinguished by various names according to their dress or 
the ponancps they observe, and so on. Such are the bai^tardltiiri who are deccnty clad 
and live in temples (among the Saniasi's this term means 'sfcular'^: the dudhddhdri, 
who livo on milk : the jntiuikdri who wear long matted hair: the muni* who observe 
perpetual silence ; and the hhnr t'ipe>'nri. who stand in contemplation. The alit, ' destitute* 
or liberated from worldly restraints does not appear to be a stict of the Jo^is, as Macauliffe 
^pys [Slklt Religion, I, p. H\2'i,hnth popular term for any mendicant: see Plaits, p. 18, 
It is believed that Jogis live for centuries as a result of their austerities, 



402 J^ogi divisions. 

The derivatioa of Augliar is obscure. The grade or order, however 
we regard it, does not appear to be connected with the Aghori or 
Ghor-pauthis who are cannibal /agf/Vs of a singularly repulsive type.* 
The Aughars of Kirdna in Jhang Hre of good repute and retain large 
jagirs granted them by the Sikhs. They are distinguished by an ochre- 
coloured turban over which is twisted a black net-work of thread 
covered with gold. The mahant is styled 2>it, and once elected may 
never again descend the hill. 

To these three degrees may perhaps be added a fourth, that of 
mahdtmd, a dignity hardly alluded to in the accounts rendered of the 
sect. A Jogi who attains to great spiritual eminence is exempt from 
wearing mundnif, the janeo, and so on. 

After initiation a Jogi may apparently select the function which he 
is to fulfil. Thus he may become a militant member of the sect, vowed 
to celibacy and styled Nanga, Nd,ga, Nddi, Nihang, Kanphara or 
Kdnphatta. 

Or he may relapse and, breaking his vow of celibacy, become a 
secular Jogi, designated Bindi-Nagi, Sanyogi (Samayogi), Gharbd,ri or 
Grihisti. 

Lastly, the initiate -Jogi may join one of the various panths or 
orders. These panths are in theory limited to twelve in number, but 
in reality they number many more than twelve. 

The divisions and offshoots of the Jogis. 
The grouping of the Jogis is exceedingly complex and appears to 
vary in different parts of these Provinces. 

Thus in Kdngra the Hindu Jogis are classed as ' Andarld,* or Inner 
and ' Bdhirla' or Outer Jogis ; and the former are further divided into 
Darshanis and Aughars. t 

'I'he distinctions between these loner and Outer groups are not 
specified, but they have different observances and their origin is thus 
accounted for : — Once when Gorakh fj;ave two goats to Machhendra's 
sons he bade them slaughter the animals at a place where none could 
see them. One boy killed his goat : but the other came back with his 
alive, and said that he had found no such spot, since if no man were 
present the birds would witness the slaughter, or, if there were no birds, 
the sun or moon. Gorakh seated the latter boy by his side and he was 
called Andatla, while the other was expelled and dubbed B^hirK. 
Both groups observe the usual Hindu social customs, except at death, 
the only difference being that the Bdhirld, only give Brahmans food and 
do not feast them, and at funerals they blow a ndd instead of the 
conch, which is used by the Andarlas. 

* P. N. Q., I, ^■l, 136, 375, 473. There is no sufficient evidence to connect Aughar with 
' ogre.' A-ghori = un-terrible, Monier-Williams, Sansk. Dicty., s, v. According to Platts 
(p .106) nnghnr means awkward, ungainly, uncouth. 

t The Darshanis have four sub-groups : Khokhar, Sonkhla, Jageru and Natti ; while 
the Aughar have six : Bhambaria, Biria, Awan, Jiwan, Kalia, Bharsi and Saroe. It does 
not appear whether these are schools or sections. 

The Bahirla are all Aughars and have a number of sub-groups : Raipur Maralu, Hetam, 
Daryethi, Molgu, Tandialu, Chuchhlu, Gugraon, Kehne, Tiargu, Dhamarchu, Phaleru, 
Sidhpuru, Karan and Jhak. 



Jogi groups, 403 

Elsewhere the Darshanis* appear as a group which is distinguished 
from the Nangas, who use flesh and spirituous liquor, which the lonner 
avoid. The latter also are said to wear no clotiios— as their name denotes, 
but the Darshanis are said to be further divided into two cla>ses, of 
which one is clothed, while the other, which smears the body with 
ashes and affects the dhuni, is not. However this may be the Darshanis 
must have their ears pierced and are thus identical with the Kanphara 
or Kanphatta Jogis, The latter are celibate and live by begging, in 
contradistinction to the Sanyogis who can marry and possess property. f 

In Jind the Jogis hrc said to be classed as (i) Bari-dargah, ' of the 
gi'eater court/ who avoid flesh and spirits, and as (ii) Chhot.i-darg^h,| 
who do not. Both groups are disciples of Mast Nath, the famous 
itialiant of Bohar. Jalandliar Niith was the sou of a Raja, whose wife 
remained pregnant for 12 years without giving birth to her child, and 
she was thought to be aflflicted with dropsy [jalandliar). At last 
the Rajd, vowed that, if a son were vouchsafed him, he would dedicate 
him to Gorakhn^th. Jalandhar Ntith was born in response to this 
vow, and founded the pantJi named after him. 

Raja Bhartari was the son of H^ja Bhoj, king of Dhdranagar. He 
had 71 ranis, of whom one, by name Pingla, was a disciple of Gorakh,§ 
who g-ave her a flower saying it would remain ever fresh as long as her 
husband was alive. One day to test Pingla's love Bhartari went 
a-hunting and sent back his blood-stained clothes and horse with tho 
news that he had been killed, but the rani, seeing the flower still fresh 
knew that the Rdj^ only doubted her love for him and in grief at his 
mistrust killed herself. When she was carried out to the burning- 
ground the R^jd, evinced great grief, and Gorakh appeared. Breaking 
his chilli, \\ the saint walked round it, weeping, and Bhartari asked 
him why he grieved. Gorakh answered that he could get the Rijd 
a thousand queens, but never a vessel like the one he had just broken, 
and he showed him a hundred ranis as fail- as Pingla, but each of them 
said ; ' Hold aloof ! Art thou mad ? No one knows how often we 
have been thy mothers or sisters or wives/ Hearing these words 
Bhartari's grief was moderated and he made Gorakh his gurii, but 
did not abandon his kingdom. Still when he returned to his kingdom 
the loss of Pingla troubled him and his other queens bade him seek 
distraction in hunting. In great pomp he marched forth, and the dust 
darkened the sun. On the banks of the Samru he saw a herd of deer, 
70 hhids with a single stag. He failed to kill the stag, and one of the 
hinds besought him to kill one of them instead, since the stag was as 
dear to them as he was to his queens, but the Rajd, said he, a Kshatriya, 
could not kill a hiod. So the hind who had spoken bade the stag meet 
the Raja's arrow, and as he fell he said: ' Give my feet to the thief

j But in Dera Ghazi Khan we find Bari-darg4h given as equivalent to Ai-panthi, and the 
Chiioti-dargiih described as the foundation of a Chamir disciple of Pir Mast Nalh, who 
bestowed the title on him in reward for his faithful service.

that he may escape with his life; my horns to a Jogi that he may use 
them as his 7iarf ; my skin to an ascetic that lo may worship on it; 
my eyes to a fair woman that she may be called mirga-iiaini^ ; and 
eat my flesh thyself.' And to this day these things are used as the dying 
stag desired. 

On his return the Rajii was met by Gorakh who said he had killed 
one of his disciples. Bhartari retorted that if he bad any spiritual 
powers he could restore the stag to life, and Gorakh, casting a little 
earth on his body, did so. Bhartari then became a Jogi and with his 
retainers accompanied Gorakh, but the latter refused to accept him 
as a disciple unless he brought alms from his ranis, addressing them 
as his mothers, and practised jo^ lor 12 years. Bhartari did as he was 
bid, and in answer to his queens' remonstrances said : " From the point 
of view of my raj ye are my queens, but from that of jog ye are my 
mothers, as the guru has bidden me call you so." Thus he became a 
peviect jogi and founded the Bhartari Bairdg panth of the Jogis. 

Upon no topic is our information so confused, contradictory and 
incomplete as it is on the subject of the various sub-orders into which 
the Jogis, as an order, are divided. The following is a list of most of 
these sub-orders in alphabetical order with a b)ief note on each : 

The Abha-panthi is probably identical with the Abhaug Naih of 
the Tahqlqdt i-Chinhti. 

The Aghori, Ghori or Aghor-panthi is an order which smears itself 
with excrement, drinks out of a human skull and occasionally digs up 
the recently buried body of a child and eats it; thus carrying out the 
principle that nothing is common or unclean to its extreme logical con- 
clusion. 

The Ai-panth is a well-known order, said to be ancient.t In Dera 
Ghaxi Khan it is called the Bari-dargah, and one of its saints, J when 
engaged in yog, cursed one of his disciples for standing before him with 
only a la7igoti on and bade him remain ndga or naked for ever. So 
to this day his descendants are called Nagas. Another account saya 
that this and the Haith-panthi order were founded by Gorakh Nsith. 

The chief dsan of the Ai-panth is at Bohar in the Rohtak district. 
It is said to have been founded by a famous guru, named Narmai-ji§ 
who was born only a few generations after Gorakh's time at Khot^ now 
in the Jind State. In veneration for him hII the succeeding gurus 
adopted the termination Ai in lieu of Nath, and this is still done at 
Khot but not at Bohar. Five generations after Narmai, Mast 
Nath or Mastai-ji became giiru at Bohar in Samhat 1788, and after 
him the affix N^th was resumed there, though the asan is still held 
by the Ai-panth. Mast Nath died in Sambat 1804, and a fair is iield 
here on Phagan sudi 9th, the anniversary of his death. The dsan 
contains no idols. Hindus of all castes are employed but those of the 
menial castes are termed Chamarwd,|| but other initiates lose their 
caste, and become merged in the order. At no('n hhog or sacramental

food ib ofEo»*ed to all tbe tiurnddhti (of Biibii Mast Ni'ith and other lights 
of r he order) ; and tlien the hjianridr or refectory is opened and food 
distributed freely to nil, no matter wliat their caste. A lamp, fed 
with ghi, is kept burning in each ffainddh. In a dharuL.^iUa near 
Bohar is a Sanskrit inscri])tion of Siuubat 133-3. 'J'he Banag or 
Bhartari Bairilg order was founded by Kajil Bhartari, and ranks after 
the Sat-Niith.* But in the west of these Provinces the Bairag's founda- 
tion is ascribed to Preni Ndth of Mochh in Mianwali, the lu-ad-quartors 
of the order being at Midni in .Sli;ih])ur. Like tlio Uaryji-nathi this 
order is an oft'shoot of that founded by Pir Hatn Niilh of Peshdwar. 
It has also representatives at Kdliibdgh and Isakhel. 

The Bhartari Bairdg Jogi's found in the Bawal tuzdmat of Ndblia 
are secular and belong to the Punia (Jat) got, which they retain. Their 
forebear Mai Natli was as a child di-iveu from his home in Delhi 
di>trict by famine, and the Muhammadan Meos of Solasbari in 
Bawal brought him up. When the Jats seized the village he lived 
l.y begging and became a jogi, so the Jats made him marry a girl 
bel')nging to a party of juggler Jogis. Then he went to Narainpur 
in Jaipur territory and became a chela of Gorakh Ndth. 

The Bharang Natli of the Tahqiqat is possibly the Handi-pharunu-. 

The Brahma ka order appears to be the same as the Sat-nath. 

The Darya-nathi order is chiefly found in the west, especially trans- 
Indus. It possesses gaddts at Makhad on the Indus, in Kohat and 
even in Quetta. 

The Dhaj-pantlii order is found in or at least repoited from Peshawar 
and in Ambala. It may be that the order derives its name from dliaj 
meaning flag. Mr. Maclagan mentions the Uhaj-panthi as followers of 
Hanuman. The Tahqiqat gives Dhajd-panthi hs the form of the name. 

The Dharm-natlii order is widely spread, but its head-quarters are 
on the Godawari. Its foundation is ascribed to a Kdja Dharm. 

The Gangd-ndthi order was founded by one of Kapal Muni's two 
disciples. It is mentioned in the TaJtqiqdt as Gangai-ndth. 

The origin of the Jdlaudhar-ndth order has already been related. 
In Annitsar it is known as Bdwii Jalandhar ke, and its members 
keep snakes. 

The Kaniba-ki arc said to be chelaa of Jalandhar Nath. Of this 
branch are the Sapelas : Maclagan, § 55. 

The Kaplani or Kapil-panthi order ascribes its origin to Kapal 
Muni, and is thus al'^o known as Kapal Peo ke. Or it was founded 
by Ajai Pal, Kapal Muni's disciple, and is thus cousin to the Gangti- 
ndthi order. 

The Kaya-nathi or Kayan-ndthi is an offshoot of the Gangfi-ndthi. 
But in Dera Ghdzi Khan it is said that they received their name from 
Pir Ratn Ndth who made an image out of the dirt of his own body. 

* At least in Dera Ghazi, in which district it is returned as Bairaj, another order (said 
to be flen\vri from it) bein;: .stylpd l-lnirnj Marigka. In Ambiila a Baraj order is 
mentioned. In Karuil »«irMii and Bhartari appear as two distinct orders. 



40^ The Jogi suh-urders. 

The Kanthar or Khantar order owes itis origin lo Gaiietlia. In 
Ambiila it is said to be eudngamous. 

LacLliman Nath's order is said in Hoshiarpur to be also known as 
the Darbari Nath Tilla Bdl Gondai, but in Amritsar is said to be 
the same as the Natesri (as in Madagan, § 55). 

The M4i-ka-panth are disciples of the Devi Kali. 

'J'he Man Manthi appear to be identical with the Man Nath, returned 
from Peshdwar, and the Manathi or Mannati in Jhelum who ascribe 
their foundation to Rajd; Rasdlu. Mr. Maclagan mentions the Man- 
Nath as followers of Rasdlu, § 55. 

The Mekhla dhdri is a class or order which is returned from Ambdla 
and its name is said to mean wearer of the tardgf. 

The Natesri order appears to have no representatives in the Punjab 
but see above under Lachhman Nath's order. 

The Nim Nathia is distinct from the order founded by Pdras Nath q.v. 
It is said to be also called Gapldni or Kisgai. 

The Papanth appears to be also called Panathi or Panpatai, a sub- 
order founded by Jalandhar as a disciple of Maiiadeo. 

The Pagal appears to be identical with the Rd<wal-Ghalla. 

The Pd,ras Nath order is sometimes shown as half an order, the 
Rdwals being its other half. But Paras Nath was one of Machhendra's 
two SODS and he founded an order which soon split up into two dis- 
tinct schools, [i) the Puj — who are cehbate but live in houses and ob- 
serve none of the rules observed by (ti) the Sartoras, who always 
wear a cloth over the mouths, strain water before drinking it, never 
kill aught that has life : further they never build houses, but lead a 
wandering life, eating only food cooked by others, and smoking from 
a chilam, never from a hukkah. That these two sub-orders are both 
Jains by religion, if not by sect, is perfectly obvious, and it is indeed 
expressly said that this Pdras Nd,th is he whom the Jains revere. 

The Rdm-ke, or Ram Chandrn-ke, panth was founded by Ram Ndth, 
a disciple of Santokh Ndth, and had its head-quarters en the Goddwari 
till it was replaced there by the Dharm-nathi. It appears to be some- 
times ascribed to R4m Chandra, but erroneously so. 

The Sant-nathi appear to be quite distinct from the Sat-odthi. 

The Sat-nath (or Brahma-ke q.v.) 

The Santokh Nathi are mentioned by Mr. Maclagan as followers of 
Bishn Narain, and are probably the Vishnu of Amritsar. 

Other orders mentioned are the Bade ke, in Dera Ghdzi Khdn, the 
Baljati in Karndl, the Bharat in Dera Ghdzi Khdn, Haith-panthi in 
Ambdjla and Jhelum, Haridni, Latetri and Mai ka panth in Dera Ghdzi 
Khdn, the Path-sana in Karndl (Patsaina in Jind), Ridh Ndth in 
Amritsar, Sahj in Ambala, and .the Bishnu in Amritsar. 

In Mr. Maclagan's lists also appear the Kalepd and Ratn Ndth : and 
in the Tahqiqdt-i-Chishti the Dhar Nath, Darpa-Nath, Kanak Ndth and 
Nag Ndth* are also mentioned. 



* Possibly the Rawals. 



Jogi offshoots. 407 

The P^dha are describecl in Ambdla as a casle, originally Jogie, but 
purely secular and now endogamous. 

The influence of Jogis on and beyond the north-west frontier is one 
of the most remarkable features of the cult. Legend connects the Gor- 
khatri at Peshawar with Gorakh, and it was once a Jopi haunt as 
both B4bar and Abu'1-Fazl testify. The chief saint ot thw Jogis in 
the north-west is Pir Patn Niltli of Peshawar/ in which district as 
well as throughout Kdbul and Khordsdn, a kahit is said to be current 
which describes his power. 

The disciples of Pir Ratn Ndth do not wear the ommdra, and to 
account for this tradition says that once when Jogis of the 12 orders 
had assembled at Tilla for a tukra observance, Ratn Ndth, who had no 
earringSjt was only assigned a half share. He protested that a Jogi 
who had earrinjjs in his heart need wear none in his ears, and he opened 
his breast to exhibit the mundra in his heart ! So his disciples are ex- 
empt from the usual rule of the sect. They appear to belong to the 
Darjd-nd,thi 'panth but the branch of Pir Ratn X^th's dera at Mi^mi in 
Shdhpur is held by Baird,g-ke- Jogis. 

The Bachhowalia is a group of Muhammadan Jogis who claim de- 
scent from one Gajjan S-k% and yet have more than one Hindu got 
(Piindhi, Chahil, Gil, Sintlhu and Rathora|). Like Hindus they marry 
outside the got. They are chroniclers or panegyrists, and live on alms, 
carrying a y/ioZ* (wallet) and a turban composed of two dopatfas, each 
of a different colour, as their distinctive costume. Originally Hindus 
they adopted Isldm and took to begging, their name being doubtless 
derived from H. hichha, ' alms,' But they have, of course, a tale to 
explain their name and say that their forebears grazed a Kumhar's 
hachha — a story inconsistent with the fact that they are not ail of one 
and the same got, but which doubtless alludes to their ancient worship 
of the earth-god. 

Another Muhammadan group is that of the Kdl-pelias as the dis- 
ciples of Ism^'il are sometimes called. Little seems to be known about 
TsmdMl except that he was initiated by one of the Sidh Sanskaripd. 
He is also said to have been an adept in black magic and 'a con- 
temporary of one Kamakha devi.' It is difficult to avoid the conjecture 
that he is in some way connected with the Ismailians. 

The Rawals, however, are the most important of the Muhammadan 
Jogi groups. Found, mainly, in the western districts they wander far 
and wide over the rest of India, and even to Europe where they practise 
aB quack occulists and physicians. The name is, indeed, said to be a 



* There are Jogi shrines at Kohat, Jalalibad and Kabul, as well as at Peshiiwar, and 
the incumbent at the three last named is styled Goscffw. Pfr Bar Nath of Kohat was 
initiated on a stone near the Bawana springs. Even the fanatical Muhammadans of these 
parts reverence Pir Ratn Nath. 

t As a novice (Aughar) he would wear no earrings and only be entitled to half a share. 
Another version is that Ratn Nath demanded a double share and, when objection was taken' 
created a man, named Kanian N4th, from the sweat and dirt of his own body. Other 
stories explain that a Jogi of eminent piety is exempt from the rule requiring a Jogi to 
wear earrin;^s and & jnnen.

States. 



408 Jogi offshoots, 

corruption of the Persian rdwinda, ' tr&veWev,' 'wanderer': and tradi- 
tion avers that wlien RiiujhH, in his love for Hir, adopted the guise of 
&faqir and wandered till ho came to Tilla^ he became Fir Bdla Ndth'a 
disciple and thence went to Jhang where he sought for his beloved. 
All his disciples and companions were called Rdwal.* 

The Rawals are sometimes said to be divided into two groups, 
Mandiat and Ghal.J but according to one account they form a half of 
one of the 12 orders, the other being the P^ras Nath, i.e. tho Jains. 
Probably this latter tnle merely means that the Rdwals like the Jains 
are an offshoot of the Jogi cults. 

The Jd*fir Firs. 

Tn the rei^n of Akhar there lived in Rsjaurl a Jogi named Shakkar 
Ntlth who was challenged by the Muhammadans to provide suoar in 
that country, in which the article was scarce. 'Shakkar' by his 
prayers caused it to rain sugar on the lOth of Rajab, 910 A. Ei. 
[Shakkar was the disciple of Badeshar Nath of Badeslntr, and when 
Akbar visited that place and ordered a fort to be built there Badeshar 
Nd,th caused a'l the springs to dry up, by throwing a stone, which 
made Akbar abandon his project.] 

* Pir ' Shakkar N^th on his death-bed, havinsr no disciples, c«lled to 
the only man near him, one Jit'fir, a Muhammadan, and made him his 
successor, thus starting a new order. He advised J^'fir to make only 
uncircumcised Muhammadans Its disciples, and this rule is still ob- 
served by the order which employs Hindu cooks, and whose members 
bore their ears, but do not eat with other Jogis, though they enjoy all 
their privileges. The Jogis of Pir Jd'fir are Sant-nathid,s by sect. 

TheJangams. 

The Jangam, or Jogi- Jangam as he is sometimes called in contradis- 
tinction to the Jogi proper, originated thus : When Shiva married 
Pdrbati no one would accept alms at his hands, so he created a man 
from his thigh (jdng) and, giving him alms, promised him immortality 
but declared he should live by begging. The Jangams are divided into 
four groups, [i) Mial, celibates, who practise /ogf in the prdoinydm form : 
{ii) Langoch, celibate, also who carry tiie image of Shiva intheNarbad- 
eshwar incarnation in a small phylactery round the neck (chiefly found 
in the south of India) : {in) Sail, also celibate, found chiefly in the hills 
as they avoid mixing with worldly people ; and [iv] Diru, found in the 
south-east Punjab. This last-named group is secular and is recruited 
from the Brahman, Rajput, Bhdt, 3At and Arora castes. Buc the got 
appears to be often lost on entering the group, for it is said to comprise 
15 gots : —

The Jogi caste. 409 

Marriage is effected by exchange, two gots being avoided.* 
Rupees 50, 25, 15 or 10 are spenr, on a wedding, according to its class. 
Widows remarry, but, if a widow marry one who is excommunicated, 
the man ia made to bathe in the Ganges and feast the brotherhood ; then 
the pair are re-admitted into the caste. 

Anotlier version is that Shiva at liis wedding created two recipients 
of his ahns, one, Jangam, from the sweat of liis brow, the otlier, 
Lingam, from his thigh. These Jangams accept alms from all Hindus^ 
at least in the western Districts, wheieaa Lingams only take them 
from Jogis and Sani^sis. But it is usuall}' said that the Jangam ac- 
cepts alms from Jogis. 

To the Jangam Shiva gave the bull's necklace hung with a bell or 
fiaras, and everything that was on his head, and so Jangams still 
wear figures of the moon, serpents, etc., on their heads. Ho also or- 
d(>red them to live by begging, and so Jangams still sing songs about 
Shiva's wedding, playing on the jara^t as they beg. Instead of the 
mnndra they wear brass flowers in their ears, carry peacock's feathers, 
and go about begging in the bazars, demanding a pice from each shop. 
They are looked upon as Brahmaiis and are said to correspond with the 
Lingayats of Central and Southern India. 

The Sapelas or Samjielas. 
The sampelas, or snake-men, claim K^nnhipi (Kanipa), the son of the 
Jhinwar who caught the fish from which Machhendra N^th had emerged : 
Kannhipi was brought up with him and became a disciple of Jalandhar 
Ndth. By which is meant that snake-charmers, like snakes, owe much 
to the waters. The sampelas are not celibate; though they have their 
ears bored and wear the mundra, with ochre-dyed clothes, and they rank 
lower than the Hindu Jogis because they will take food from a Muham- 
madan and eat jackal. They tame snakes, playing on the gourd-pipe 
{bin), and lead a wandering life, but do not thieve. Their semi-religious 
character places them above the Kanjars and similar tribes. Some of 
their gots are : — 



Gadaria 

Tkiik. 

Phenkra. 



Linak. 

Chauhan. 

Taliliwal. 



Athwal. 
Sohtra. 
Bamna. 



In marriage four gots are avoided. 

The Jogis as a caste. 

The secular Jogi or Samyogi, as he should apparently be called, does 
iu parts of the Punjab form a true caste. Thus in Kullu he has become 
a Nath and in AmbJila a Jogi-Padha. In Loharu there is a small Jogi 
caste of the J^tu tribe which was founded by a Rajput of that tribe. 
Of his two sons the descendants of one, Bdre N.ith are secular, when 
those of the other Bar N4th remain celibate, pierce their ears and wear 
the nmmdray though how they are recruited is not explained. In all 
respects they follow the usual rites save at death. They bury the body 
seated, facing north and place a pitcher of water undei- its right arm 
and some boiled rice under its left arm. Widow remarriage is 
allowed. 



* Marriage by purchase appears to be forbidden, and if the bride's family has not a boy 
eligible to marry at once, the bridegroom's family will owe them a girl till one is required."

The Kanthars are said to be endogamous, but all the others inter- 
marry. In Niibha the pddhas, however, do not appear to be a caste, 
but are simply Jogis who teach children Hindi. 

Though professing Jogis are forbidden to marry, many of them 
do so, and it is impossible to disentangle the Jogis who abandon celibacy 
from those who do not profess it at all and form a caste. In Dera 
Ghdzi Khiin, for instance, Jogis intermarry but not within their caste 
as Jogis. There is no bar to Hindu or a Sanyasi taking a Jogi girl 
in marriage, but respectable Hindus do not do so. Their marriage 
ceremonies are generally like those of Hindus, as Brahmans perform 
them. A Jogi who marries is regarded with comtempt by his brother 
Jogis, who do not sraoke wich him until he has given a feast at a 
cost of Rs. 12-8 to an assembly of Jogis at some sacred place, such 
as the bank of the Ganges, or a fair. 

On the other hand Grihisti Jogis retain many outward signs of the 
professing Jogi. They wear saffron coloured clothes and sometimes 
smear ashes over the body. They use the janeo of black wool which 
is ^nailer than that worn by a Brahman or other twice-born Hindu. 
They wear a ndd of horn or else have a bit of wood made in the shape 
of a ndd and attached to the janeo. They are obliged to wear a 
paunchi of wool round their hands and feet and a woollen string round 
the waist. They also use the rosary of rudrahsh beads. Some have 
their ears bored while others go to Gorakh Ndth's gaddi and get a 
hanthi tied round the neck. Though the use of flesh and liquor is 
permissible they follow the Brahmans and abstain from them. They 
live on alms and by singing the love tales of Hir and Rdnjha, etc., and 
ballads like those of Jaimal and Fattah, etc. Others live by exhibiting 
nadia bulls. In Karndl the Jogis by caste are generally Hindus and 
receive offerings made to the impure gods. They form one of the 
lowest of all castes and practise witchcraft and divination, being also 
musicians.

Joiya. The Joiya is one of the 36 royal races of Rd,jputs, and is described 
in the ancient chronicles as "lords of the Jangal-des," a tract which 
comprehended Hariiina, Bhattidna, Bhatner, and Nagor. They also 
held, in common with the Dehia with whom their name is always 
coupled, the banks of the Indus and Sutlej near their confluence. Some 
seven centuries" ago they were apparently driven out of rlio Indus tract 
and partly subjugated in the Bdgar country by the Bhatti; and in the 
middle of the 16tli century they were expelled from the Joiya canton 
of Bikdner by the Rtlthor rulers for attempting to regain their inde- 
pendence. Tod remarks that "the Rajputs cai'ried fire and sword 
i.ito this country, of which they made a desert. Ever since it has 



J oiy a traditions, 411 

remained desolate, and the very name of Joiya is lost, though the vestiges 
of considerable towns bear testimony to a reiiiotn antiqi)itv." 'J^he 
Joiya, however, have not disapi^eared. They still hold all tliu banks of 
the Sutlej from the Wattu border nearly as far down as its confluence 
with the Indus, though the Bha^tis turned them out of Kahror, and they 
lost their semi-independence when their })ossessions formed a part of 
the Bah.twalpur State ; they hold a tract in Jiik.lner od the bed of the 
old Ghaggar iust below Bhatner, their ancient seat; and they are found 
in no inconsiderable numbers on the middle Sutlej of Lahoi'e nnd I*'c- 
rozepur and on the lower Indus of the Derajat and Muzaffargarh, about 
a third of their whole number being returned as Jats. The Multan bar 
is known to this day as the Joiya bar. General Cunningham says flint 
they are to be found in some numbers in the Salt Range or mountains 
of Jud, and identifies them w'ith the Jodia or Yodia, the warrior class of 
India in Panini's time (450 B. C), and indeed our figures show some 
2,700 Joiya in Sh^hpur. But Panini's Jodia would perhaps more pro- 
bably be the modern Gheba, whose original tribal name is said to be 
Jodra, and Gheba a mere title. 'J'he Joiya of the Sutlej and of Hiss^r 
trace their origin from Bhatner, and have a curious tradition, current 
apparently from Hiss^r to Montgomery, to the effect that they cannot 
trace their Rajput descent in the male line. 'J'he Hisssir Joiya make 
themselves descendants in the female line of Sejaor Sameja, who accom- 
panied the eponymous ancestor of the Bhatti from Muttra to Bhatner. 
■ This probably means that the Joijas claim Yiidu ancestry. The Mont- 
e;omery Joiya have it that a lineal descendant of Benjamin, Joseph's 
brother, came to Bikaner, married a Raja's daughter, begot their ancestor, 
and then disappeared as ?ifaqir. The tradition is perhaps suggested 
by the word /oi, meaning "wife." The Montgomery Joiya 6ay that 
they left Bikaner in the middle of the 14th century and settled in 
Bahawalpur, where they became allies of theLangah dynasty of Rlultdn, 
but were subjugated by the Daudpotra in the time of Nadir Shah. 
ITie Multan Joiya say that they went from Bikdner to Sindh and thence 
to Multan. This is probably due to the fact of their old possessions ou 
the Indus having died out of the tribal memory, and been replaced by 
their later holdings in Bikaner. They are described by Cap tan 
Elphiustone as '* of smaller statuj'u than the great Ravi tribes, and 
considered inferior to them in regard of the qualities in which the 
latter especially pride themselves, namely bravery and skill in cattle- 
stealing. They possess large herds of cattle and aro bad cultivators." 
The Maliars are a small tribe on the Sutlej op})osite Fazilka, and are said 
to be descended from MaVir, a " brother of the Joiya, They are said 
to bo quarrelsome, silly, thievish, fond of cattle, and to care little for 
agricultural ])ursuits." 

In Bahawalpur the mirdsis of tlie Joiyas have compiled for thcin a pedigree-table which 
makes them and tlic Mahars Quraishis by origin and descended from lyas, a descendant of 
Mahmiid of Ghazni. But the mirdm'ti of each sept of the Joiyas give a dilYerent pedigreo 
above lyas, a fact which tends to show that the Joiyas were in their origin a confederation 
of warrior clans. 

The Lakh wera sept and others recount the following talc. They say that lyas, son of 
Bakr, came to I'huharbar (now Anupgarh), the capital of Rjija Chiihar Sameja. in the guise 
of a.fatjir, and married Nal, the Raja's eldest daughter,* by Avhom he became the fatlier of 
Joiya in 400 II. Joiya was brought up in the house of his mother's father as a Hindu. 



* Pal and Sal being the other two. 



412 The Joiya septs. 

though his father was a Muhammadan and had married Nal by nikdh and so Joiya's 
children, Jabbu, Isung, Bisung, Nisung, and Sahan Pal, received Hindu names. From the 
yoiiniji'gt (apparently) of these sons the Joiyas claim descent.* The Joiyas as a tribe regard 
Ali Kh4n, Lakhwera, ra'is of Shahr Farid as their chief, and his influence extends over the 
Joiyas in Multan. A Joiya who has committed theft Tvill not deny the fact before 
this chief. 

The Lakhwera, Bhadera, Ghazi Khanana, Kulhera, Daulatana, Kamera and Mangher septs 
and a few others, observe the n'i Hat/.- ceremony. This consists in slaughtering two rams 
(oluitt'i)^) and making a pulao (with rice cooked in ghi) of the flesh. This is given in 
charity in the name of their ancestor Allahditta who single-handed resisted a party of 50 
Baloch who tried to raid the cattle he was tending in the Cholistan. Allahditta was killed, 
but his bravery is commemorated in the iriuaik and his tomb in the Taj-Sarwar is greatly 
fri-quented by the tribe. Lunan's name is also mentioned in the uinaik, because he fell in s 
tight with Lahr Joiya, a descendant of Jai Sung at Kharbara in Bikaner, where his tomb 
still exists. The descendants of the Joiyas shown in the pedigree-table from Bansi upwards 
observe only the vAnaik of Lunau, not that of Allahditta. 

The Joiyas are brave, but, like the Wattus, addicted to theft. The Lakhwera sept is the 
highest in the social scale and has a great reputation for courage. The tribe is devoted to 
horses and buffaloes. No Joiya considers it derogatory to plough with his own hands, but 
if a niHU gives up agriculture ami takes to trade or handicraft the Joiyas cease to enter into 
any kind of relationship with him. Sahn Pal is said to have coined his own money at 
Bhatner. a proof that he exercised sovereign power. Bawa Farid-ud-Dfn, Shakar-(janj, 
converted Lunan, Ber and Wisul to Islam and blessed Lun^n, saying " Lundn, dundn, 
r.haurtdn" i.e., "may Lunan's posterity multiply." These three brothers wrested the 
fortress of Bhatinda from the Slave Kings of Delhi and ruled its territory, with Sirsa and 
Bhatner, independently. 

Lakhkho, son of Luna'.n, headed a confederation of the Joiyas, Bhattis, llathors and 
Waryas against the Vikas, or Bikas, the founders of Bikauer, whose territory they devast- 
ated until their king. Raja Ajras, gave his daughter Kesar in marriage to Lakhkho, and 
from that time onwards the Hindu Rajputs of Bikaner gave daughters to the Muhammadan 
Joi^'as as an established custom up to within the last 50 years, when the practice ceased. 

After Lakhkho, Salim Khan rose to power in the time of Aurangzeb. He founded a 
Sali'mgarh which he gave to Pir Shauq Shah, whence it became called Mari Shauq Shah, 
and founded a second Sali'mgarh, which was however destroyed by Aurangzeb's orders, but 
on its ruins his son Farid Khan I founded Shahr Farfd in Bahawalpur. After the downfall 
of the Mughal empire the Lakhwera chiefs continued for some time to pay tribute at Multan 
and Nawab Wall Muhammad Khan Khakwani, its governor, married a Joiya girl, Ihsan 
Biti, and thus secured their adherence, Avhich enabled him to find a refuge among the 
Admera and Saldera Joiyas when the Mahrattas took possession of Multan in 1757 A. D. 
After this the Joiyas under Farfd Khan II revolted against Salih Muhanmaad Khan, whom 
the Mahrattas had appointed governor of Multan, and plundered his territory, but in 1172 
A. D., when Ahmad Shah, Abdali, had expelled the Mahrattas from Multan he re-appointed 
WaU Muhammad Khin to its governorship and to hiiu the Joiyas submitted. Under the 
emperor Zaman Khan, however, the Joiyas again rose in rebellion and at the instance of 
the governor of MiUtan Nawab Mubarak Khan of Bahawalpur annexed the territory of 
Farid Khan II. 

The Joiya septs are very numerous, 4G being enumerated as principal septs alone t Of 
these the more important are the Lakhwera, Daulatana, Bhadera Nihal-ka, Ghazi-Khanana, 
Jalwana, which has a sub-sept called Bhaon. their ancestor having been designated 
Nekokara-Bhai or the " virtuous brother " by Abdulla Jahanian. Most of the Joiya septs 
are eponymous, their names ending in -ka and sometimes in -era. 

The following septs are found in Montgomery (where they are classed 
as Rajput agriculturists) : — Akoke, Bahltlna, Bhatti, Firozke, Bassanke, 



* This table is printed in full in the Bahdicalfur Gazetteer, p. 46. 

t Joiyas arc divided into a large number of " naks'' : (i) Lakhwera. (ii'y Mahmiidera, 
Kamrana, Madera (all three equal), (iii) Jalwana and Daulatana. The grading of the 
tribe in the social scale is as above. They intermarry, as a rule, only among themselves, 
but a nak of one grade will not give daughters to a iwk of a lower grade, though the former 
will take from the latter. 

In the time o f Akbar they were the predominate tribe of the Maiisi and Lodhran tahsils, 
and then, or soo n after, four brothers, Jagan, Mangan, Luddan and Lai colonised the country 
round Luddan, and were followed by fresh bands from across the Sutlei. Multan Gr.,

JuLABA, fern, -i, syu. safed-hdf. The weavers proper, of which the Juldha, as 
he is called in the east, and the Paoli as he is called in the villao-es of 
the west, is the type, are an exceedingly numerous and importHnt 
artisan, class, more especially in the western Districts where no weaving 
is done by the leather-working or scavenger castes. It is very jiossible 
that the Julahd, is of aboriginal extraction. Indeed Sir James Wilson 
who had, in the old Sirsa district, unequalled opportunities of com- 
paring different sections of the people, is of opinion that the Julahds 
and Chamdrs are probably the same by origin, the distinction between 
them having arisen from divergence of occupation. Be this as it may, 
there is no doubt that the present position of the two is widely dis- 
similar. The Jnlalia. does not work in impure leather, he eats no 
carrion, he touches no carcases, and ho is recognised by both Hindu 
and Musalman as a fellow-believer and admitted to religious equality. 
In a word, the Chamdr is a menial, the Juldha an artisan. The real 
fact seems to be that the word Julahii, from the Persian julali, a ball 



414 Juldhd groups, 

of thread, the equivalent Hindi term being" Tiinti, is the name of the 
higliest occupation ordinarily open to the outcast section of the com- 
munity. Thus wc find Koli-Julfih^s, Chamar-Juldhas, Mochi-Julahds, 
Rdmd^si-Juldhds, and so forth : Hnd it is probable that after a few 
generations these meu drop the prefix which denotes their low origin, 
and become Julahas pure and simple. The weaver appears to be called 
Golah in Peshawar and Kasbi in Hazara. 

The Julilha proper is scantily represented in the south-east Punjab, 
where his place is taken by the Koli* or Chamdr- Juldhd. and 
Dhauak ; and he is hardly known in the Derajtit, where probably the 
Jdt does most of the weaving, fn the rest of the Province he con- 
stitutes some 3 to 4 per cent, of the total population. He is generally 
a Hindu in Kdngra and Delhi, and often Hindu in Karndl, Ambdla, and 
Hoshiarpur; but on the whole some 92 per cent, of the Julahas are 
Musalmdn. Sikhs are few in number. 

The Jnlaha confines himself almost wholly to weaving. He is not 
a true village menial, being paid by the piece and not by customary 
dues. He is perhaps the most troublesome of the artisan classes. Like 
the shoe-maker of Europe, he follows a wholly sedentary occupation, 
and in the towns at least is one of the most turbulent classes of the 
community. There is a proverbial sayitig : " How should a weaver be 
patient ? " Indeed the contrast between the low social standing and 
the obtrusive pretentiousness of the class is often used to point a pro- 
verb : " A weaver by trade, and his name is Fatah Khan {* victorious 
chief').' "Lord preserve us! The weaver is going out hunting!" 
" Himself a weaver, and he has a Saiyad for his servant ! " " What ! 
Pathans the bond servants of weavers ! " and so forth. 

Tlie Julaha sub-divisions are exceedingly numerous, but the names of 
most of the larger ones are taken from dominant land-owning tribes. 
Some of the largest are: — Bhattis who are very widely distributed; 
Khokhars chiefly found west of Lahore ; Janjuas and Awans in the 
Rawalpindi division; Sindhus in the Central Punjab, and the Jarydls 
in Kangra. The Kabirbansi are found in Ambala and Kangra, and ap- 
parently this word has become a true tribal naroe and now includes 
Musalmau Julahds. It is derived from the great Bhagat Kabir of 
Benares who was himself a Juldha, and whose teaching most of the 
Hindu Julahds profess to follow. The eastern Julahas are said to 
be divided into two great sections, Deswale, or those of the country, and 
Tel, the latter being supposed to be descended from a Julahd who 
married a Teli woman. The latter are socially inferior to the former. 
In the Jumna districts there are also a Gangapuri (? Gangapdri) and a 
Multani section, the former being found only in the Jumna valley and 
the latter on the borders of the Malwa. 

Further west we find the Muhammadan Julahas divided into several 
o-roups, mostly teratorial, e. g., in Jind we have the Jdngli, Deswali,

Sikh times they were glad to accept grain as wageS; but they now exact cash.

Bajwarya and Parya sub-castes. But the Ndbha version gives six 
groups, four territorial, viz., Jdngla, Pawddhre (' of the Pawddli '), Bdgn 
and Multdni (these two latter are uot fou?id iu the State), one called 
Pare and a sixth called Mochia which is nominated from the Mochia. 
The four groups found in Jind all oat and smoke together. The Jdnglis 
are foand in the Jangal tract of tahsil Sangrur. They have heredi- 
tary Pirs, who are Sayyids. h\ adopting a Pir a miirid (disciple) takes 
?k cuip oi sharhat from his hand and drinks it, believing thnt by so 
doing he will attain to Bahisht (l^aradise). Thoy revere their l^irs, 
give them a rupee and a wrapper when they come to their house and 
entertain them well. The Jdngli (/ots are tliose of the Jdts and Rajputs, 
and it is said tliat they were converted during the reign of Aurangzeb. 
Some f)f them still retain their Brahman parohils and give them money 
at weddings. 

They only avoid their own got in marriage. 

The Pare iu Nabha follow the Muharamadan Law as to marriage, 
whereas the other five groups avoid four gots in inai-riage, like Hindus.* 

The Muhamtnadan Julaluis are said to be very strict observers of the 
Id-ul-fitr, just as the Qassiibs (butchers) hold the Id-ul-zuhd in .special 
esteem, while the Kanghigarans affect the Shab-i-banU and the 
Sa.yyids the Muharram.f

On the other hand the Hindu Julahds of these Phulkidn States are 
ivided into sectarian groups, such as the Riimdasis and Kabirpanthis. 

The Kamddsis are the followers of the saint, Rdm Dds, the Chamdr 
who was a chela of Lakhmir. Having abandoned his calling as a shoe- 
maker, he took up weaving and followed the teachings of the Granth. 
The Kamdasi do not eat, smoke or intermarry with the Chamars. 
They practise kareica and perform the wedding rite, according to the 
anand bdni of the Granth Sdhib, fire being lighted before the scripture 
and seven turns [jiheras) being made round the fire, while the anand 
hdni is read. No Brahman is called in. They burn their dead and 
carry the ashes to the Ganges. Some of their gots arc : — 



1. Bhangar. 

2. Barah. 

3. Berwal. 



4. Sokri. j 7. Samjar. 

5, Chohan. 8, Senhmir. 
G. Saroe. I 9. Miti. 

I 10. Goru. 



The Kabirpanthis are the followers of Kabir Bhagat, chela (disciple) 
of Rdmanand, founder of tho Ramanandi sect of the Bairagis. Kabir 
is said to have been born at Benares and adopted by a Musalm^n 
JuMhd during the reign of Sikandar Shdh Lodi (1488-1512 A. D.). 
The story goes that Kabir wished to be Ramanand's chela but he re- 
fused to adopt him as ha was a Muhammadan. So one day Kabir lay 
down on the road by which Rdmanand went to bathe in the Ganges 
every morning, and by chance Hiiinanand touched him with his foot. 
He exclaimed " hdm, Rdm,^' so Kabir took the word Ram as his Guru 
mantra and assumed the mala or beads and tilah or forehead mark of

a Bair%i. At first R{lmana,nd was opposed to him, but after som dis- 
cussion he accepted him as his chela. His doctrine and precepts are 
very popular and are embodied in the Sukh Nidhdn Granth, the Bijak 
and other poems. 

Kabir used to earn his Hvelihood by weaving blankets which he sold 
for 7 taJcJcas a-piece. One day Falsehood (jhiith) appeared to him in 
human guise and urged him to demand 12 takkis instead of 7 : he did 
60 but only received 9, so he said : — 

Sache }:ahdn to mariye — Jhuthe jagat patidive, 
Sat tahhe Id hhiird, — Mera 'iiau talche lih jaive, 

"If I speak the truth, I shall suffer, since the world is content with 
lies, so I spoke false and sold my blanket for 9 takkas." 

Since then falsehood has been rife in the world. Starch owes its 
origin to a sparrow's having let its droppings fall on Kabir's cloth, as he 
was weaving. Every weaver invokes Kabir or LuqniSn on beginning 
work. 

As a Kabirpanthi, or follower of Kabir's teaching, the Juldha calls 
himself Kabirbansi or a descendant of Kabir, just as the Chhimba 
prefers to be called Namdevi (descendant of Nd,mdeo). They will never 
take a false oath in the names of these supposed ancestors, and even 
when in the right, seldom venture to swear by them. Both castes are 
offended at the ordinary names of JuMha and Darzi, i. e., Chhimba).^ 

The Jnld,hds, like the darzis, are recruited from various castes, but 
especially from the Dhd,nak and Cham^r below, whereas the tailors 
are recruited from the castes above them. 

JuN, lit. ' louse,' a 3^ tribe found in Karndl, originally settled in Delhi. 

JuNAN, a tribe in Bah^walpur, descended from J^m Juna,t who ruled 
Sind in the 8th century of the Hijra. They give their name to the 
State of Junagadh. The Junans migrated from Shikd,rpur iu the 18th 
century A. D. and were granted lands in Bah^walpur. 

JuND-BuGDiAL, a clan of the Awd,ns, so called from Jund, their principal 
village, found in Rawalpindi and Pindi Gheb. Their traditions point to 
their being a race of marauders. 

JuNHAL, a Rajput tribe, once numerous and powerful. It is found on the 
borders of Kashmir and the Kahuta tahsil, in Rawalpindi, in a beautiful 
country. They were nearly all destroyed by the Gakkhars and were 
rivals of the Hadwals. 

JuNHf, a Muhammadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery.

KabI R-PANTni, a follower of Kabir. A life of Kabir, who was a little earlier 
than Luther, having been born in 1440, and who died in 1518 A, L), 
is beyond the scope of this article.* Of all the fourteen persona 
usually classed as l^liagats or saintSi viz., Bt-ni, Bliikan, Dhanna, Shaikh 
Farid, Jaidev, Kabir, N^mdeo, Pipd, Rdrndnand, Ravidds, badhnd, 
Sainii, Surdds and 'rrilochant (whose, lives are, for the most part, given 
in the BJiaktamdU , or the North Indian 'Lives of the Saint>i ') Kabir 
and Tulsi Das have had the greate-t iutiuenco for good on the unedu- 
cated classes of Northern and ('entral India. 

A mystery hangs over Kabir's birth, bub it appears that whoever 
his parents may have been, ho was brought up in a family of Musalman 
weavers at Benares. He is generally looked on as haviug been a 
weaver by caste, and the weavers of the country by a process well 
knoAvn in eastern ethnology are fond of calling themselves the descend- 
ants of this celebrated member of tlieir caste.J Many of tlie Juldh;is 
in the Punjab return their caste as Kabirbansi, and many of those who 
return their sect hs Kabirbansi or Kabirpanthi, are probably little more 
than ordinary weavers who have no idea of distinguishing themselves 
from other Hindu weavers in matterM of doctrine. However, Kabir 
whatever his caste may really have been, is said to have been a pupil 
of K/imdtiand, and whether this be true or not, it is beyond doubt that 
he imbibed a good deal of tliat master's teaching. From one point 
of view the Kabirpauthis are merely Kdmdnandis who refuse to worship 
idols. 

In the 14tli century Rdmdnand, the founder of the Bairagis, lived 
at Benares. One day he went to gather flowers for worship in bis 
garden, but there he was seized and taken by the gardener's daughter 
to one of the rulers of that period. The girl took with her also the 
flowers which she herself had picked, and on the road found that they 
had turned into a handsome child. Thinking Ramdnand a wi/ai-d she 
left both him and the child on the spot and fled homewards. 
Ramdnand then gave the child to a newly wedded Muhainmadan 
JuUh^ and his wife who chanced to pass that way, and they brought 
the boy up as their own son. 

Another version is that a Brahman's wife craved the boon of a sow 
and used to do homage to her sddhii for one. But one day her hus- 
band's sister went to do him reverence in her stead, and it was to her 
that the sdiihn granted tlic desired boon, though she was a virgin. On 
learning this tlie sddhu declared himself unable to recall his gift, and 
in due C(mrse a child was born to her from a boil which formed on her 
hand when it was scratched by the rope at a well. In her shame she

secretly cast the child into a stream, where it was found by a weaver 
and his wife on their way home after their muhldwa. The child wa3 
named Kabir, from kiir, pabn, and blr, a son, and one day his adoptive 
mother took him to a tauk to bathe. There too came Rlmdnand and 
hurt the boy with his sandals, but, when he be-gan to cry, the saint 
endowed hitu with unrai-ulous powers. Oq his death Hiadus aud 
Muhammadans disputed for possession of his b"dy, so it was placed 
under- a doth and when that was again removed it had disappeared. 
Half the cloth was then burnt by the Hindus, and the other half 
buried by the Muhamniadans. 

" In the midst of the dispute," says Professor Wilson, '' Kabir 
himself appeared amongst them, and desiring them to look under the 
cloth supposed to cover his mortal remains, immediately vanished. On 
obeying his instructions they found nothing under the cloth but a heap 
of flowers." The Hindus took a hnlf of them and burnt them at 
Benares ; the MuhammadHUS took the other half and buried them near 
Gnrakhpur, where his death is said to have occurred. Flower-born, 
Kabir at his death turned to flowers again. 

Kabfr is in many ways rather a literary, than a religious, celebrity, 
and his writings, in the cnmmon Bhasha, are very vuluminous. The 
Adi-Granth of the Sikhs is full of quotations from him, and he is more 
often quoted there than any other of the Bhagats. His apothegms 
are constantly on the lips of the educated classes, whether Hindu or 
Musalman, even at the present day ; and possibly there is no native 
author wliose words are more often quoted than those of Kabir. 
It is noticeable, too, that Kabir instead of impressing on his disciples, 
like most Hindu leaders, the necessity of absolute adherence to the 
Guru, was fond of stimulating enquiry and encouraging criticisms of 
his own utterances. 

Kabir was probably a Muhammadan Sufi,* but as a Fufi his teachinfj 
was addressed to Hindus as well as Muhammadans. Wilson's descrip- 
tion of the Kabirpanthi doctrines is still exact : — 

*' The Kabirpanthis, in cousequence of their master having been a reputed disciple of 
Bimauand and of their paying more respect to Vishnu than the other members of the 
Hindu triad, are always included among the Vai^'hnava sects and maintain, with most 
of them, the Ham^wata especiall}', a friendly intercourse and political alliance. It is 
no part of their faith, however, to worship any Hindu deity, or to observe any of the 
rites or ceremonials of the Uindns, whether orthodox or schismatical. Such of their 
members as are living in the world conform outwardly to all the usages of their tribes 
and caste, and some of them even pretend to worship the usual divinities, although this is 
considered as going rather further than is justifiable. Those, however, who have aban- 
doned th« fetters of society abstain from all the ordinary practices, and address their 
homage chiefly in chanting hymns exclusively to the invisible Kabir. They use no 
mantra nor fixed form of salutation ; they have no peculiar mode of dress, and some of 
them go nearly naked, without objecting, however, to clothe themselves in order to appear 
dressed when clothing is con.-idered decent or respectful. The 7nahants wear a small scull 
cap; the frontal marks, if worn, are usually those of the Vaishnava sects, or they make 
a Btreak with sandal or gopirhmdan along the ridge of the nose ; a necklace and rosary of 
tuUi are al-^o worn by them, but all these outward signs are considered of no importance 
and the inward mail is the only essential point to be attended to." 

• According to JlaoaulifEn {Sikh Religion^ VI, p. l-fl"), Kabir held the doctrine of 
ahiTiija or I he duty of non-destruction of life, even that of flowers. This doctrine would 
appear to be due to Jain influences. Kabfr is reputed to have had a bob, Kam4l, who 
refused to look with favour on Hindus (VVestcott, op. cit., p, 42) and who was thereupon 
lost to bis father, though, accordiug to Macauliffe, he li believed bj tha K&bfr-pan this to 
bave been re-animated by Kabir.

Kab irpanth i — Eab irwdh. 4 j 9 

It is however very doubtful if the view that Kabfr was probably 
a Muhammadan Sufi can be accepted with con6(lence, and Dr. 
G. A. Grierson would legnrd the s^cr. founded by Kabir as one of 
the bhakii-sects. A common feature of many of th<'se sects is the 
viahdparsdda or paciamental tneal. On the evening of the appointed 
day the woishippers assemble and the mahant, or leading cel^-brant, 
reads a brief address, find then adows a short interval for prayer and 
meditation. All who feel themselves unworthy to proceed further then 
withdraw to a distance. Those that remain approach the senior 
celebrant in turn, and placing their hands togetlier receive into the 
paimofthe right hand, which is uppermost, a small consecrated wafer 
and two other articles of consecrated food. They then approacli another 
celebrant, who pours into the palm of the right hand a few drops of 
WHter, which ihey drink. This foe d and water are regarded as Kabir'a 
special gift, and it is said that all wlio receive it worthily will have 
eternal life. Part of the sacramental food is ' reserved' and is carefully 
kept from pollution for administration to the sick. After the sacra- 
ment there is a substantial meal which all attend, and which in its 
character closely resem Ides the early Christian bve-f easts. It is possi- 
ble that this rite was borrowed !roin the Jesuit missionaries at Ao-ra, 
but the head-quarters of the Kabirpanthi sect are at Benares, and 
the rite is now likely to bo a survival of historian influences.* 

Tfie Kabirpanthi sddhs or faqirs in this Province wear generally 
clothes dyed with hrickdust colour [geru) ; and both they and the laitv 
abstain from flesh and spirits. The present followers of Kabir hold 
an intermediate position between idolatry and monotheism, but the 
misf^ion of Kabir himself is generally looked on as one directed against 
idolatry; and at Kanwardeh, near Ballabgarh, in the Delhi district, 
there is a C'>ramunity of Kabir fant his descended from an Atrgarwdl 
Bania of Puri, who used to travel with 52 cart-l-'ads of Shivs and 
Sdligrams behind him, but who was convinced by Kabir of the error 
of his ways. Tlie sect of Kabirpanthis is probably better known in the 
Gangetic Valley than in the Punjab, and the Kabirpnnthis are larcrely 
found in the south-east of the Province ; but consideral)lo nunibnrs are 
also I'eturned from Sidlkot and Gurddspur, and it is said that the 
"Meghs and Batwdls, so common in thoee districts, are very generally 
Kabirpanthis. The sect is also very largely recruited from the Chamar 
(leather worker) and Julahii (weaver) castes, and it is open to men of 
all classes to become Kabirpanthis. The Kabirpanthi will almost 
always describe himself as a Hindu, but a certain number have 
returned the name as that of an independent religion, and some as a 
sect of the Sikhs. 

An offshoot of the sect is the Dharm Ddsids, founded by a wealthy 
merchant of Benares who turned sdd}t,ii. The Dharm Dasids, Itowever, 
appear to differ in no way from the Kabirpanthis in doctrine, and they 
are very rarely found in the Punjab. t

K&CHERA, — An occupational caste of glass-workers. The term is sometimes 
applied to the Ciiurigak or makers of bracelets. The Kacheras in the 
Bd,\val nizdmat oi JSabha are both Hindu and Muhammadan and claim 
Riiiput origin, e. g. their gots include Chauh^ns from Jaipur. Thoy 
were outcast cd for adopting their present occupation and now inter- 
marry, avoiding lour gots, only among themselves. Their customs are 
those of the Jats, with whom they can smoke, etc. They still worship 
the welF after the birth of a son and it is again worshipped at weddings, 
when the bride's father gives sharbat to tlic hardt, an old Rajput 
usage. Hindu Kachera womeu never wear blue, because one of their 
caste once became sati. She is worshipped at all festivities, a cocoanut 
being offered to her. The Kacheras' giorii is the mahant of a Baird,gi 
dehra at Bagwdra in Jaipur, but they Lave Brahman 'paroliits. 

KACHnr, like the Lodha, a well-known, cultivating caste of Hindustd,n, found 
in the Punjab chietly in the Jumna districts, though a few of them 
have moved on westwards to the great cantonments. Almost without 
exception Hindus, they are said to be the market gardeners of Hindus- 
tan, and of low standing. In the Punjab they are said to be generally 
engaged in the cultivation of water-nuts and similar produce ; indeed 
in many parts they are called Singhari (from ninghdra, a water-nut) as 
commonly as Kaclihi. 

Kachdee, a Mahtam clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery.

Kadiani, or, more correctly, Ahmadiya. A follower of the late MirzaGhuMm 
Ahmad of Kadian in Gurdd.spur. In 1900 in view of the approaching 
census of 1901, the sect adopted the designation of Ahmadiya. The 
founder of the sect was a Barlas Mughal, whose family catne from 
Persia in the time of Bd,bar and obtained a jdgir in the present District 
of Gurdaspur. Beginning as a Maulavi with a special mission to the 
sweepers, the Mirza eventually advanced claims to be the Mahdi or 
Messiah, expected by Muhammadans and Christians alike. The sect 
hotvever emphatically repudiates the doctrine that the Mahdi of Isldm 
v/ill be a warrior and relies on the Sahik Buhhdri, the most authentic 
of the traditions, which says * he shall wage no wars, but discontinue 
war for ttie sake of religion.' In his voluminous writings the Mirza 
combated the doctrine of jihad and the sect is thus opposed to the 
extreme section of the Ahl-i-Hadis.

The Kafir septs. 421 

Chitral, Afghduistan aud the Hindu Kusli. Kofir means simply 
'infidel, aud the Kafirs converted to lalam are styled Shaikhs, but 
regarded by the K;lfirs as still their kin. 

Sir George Kobutson"*^ divides the Kdfirs into Sidhposhor black-robed, 
Waiguli and Presunguli or Viron and mentions a fourth tribe called 
Ashkunt, as to whom little or nothing is known, though they are probaljly 
allied to the Waigulis. The Presun, Waiguli and Ashkan are classed 
as Safodposh or white-robed. The Siahposh comprise 5 clans— Katir, 
Mamun or Miiduj^al, Kashtan or Kashtoz, Kdm or Kamtor and Istrat 
or Gaurdesh. Of these the Katirs are probably more numerous than 
all the remaining tribes of Kdfiristan put together. They are sub- 
divided : into the Kamor or Lutdehchis, in the Biishgul valley ; the 
Kti or Katwiir of the Kti valley ; the Kulam ; aud the Ramgulis or 
Gabariks, the latter, the most numerous of the Katir clans, being 
settled in the west of Kdfiristdn on the Afghiin frontier. The Kd,m 
inhabit the BashgulJ and its lateral valleys. The Gaurdesh folk 
are said to be very different from the other Siahposh and to be, in 
great part, a remnant of an ancient people called Arom. 

Of the Safedposh the Presun, who are called Viron by their Muham- 
madan neij^hbours, inhabit the Presungul and are probably a very an^ 
cient people, different from the Siahposh on the one hand and the Wai 
and Ashkuri on the other. They are poor fighters and have patient, 
stolid faces. Though heavy in their movements compared with other 
Kafirs, they are very industrious and capable of great feats of endur- 
ance. The Wai speak a language quite different to that spoken in 
Presungul or by the Sifihposh and are a bravo high-spirited race, 
quarrelsome but hospitable. The Ashkun, half of whom are Muham- 
raadans, speak a language like the Wai dialect and are friendly to that 
tribe though at war with all the others. 

Another ancient race, the Jazhi, is said to exist at Pittigul§ and 
Gaurdesh, but from intermarriages with the Kam and others they cannot 
now be distinguished from the Bashgul. 

The clans are further sub-divided. Thus the Kam have 10 septs and 
the Bashgul Katirs 7, including : — 



f Utahdari, which produces the 
I tribal priests. — 
Kam septs. •{ Garakdari ^ the two largest

K4m village has. Moreover the Kamdesh utab or priest is not only a village, but also a 
tribal, functionary. 



L 



422 The Kafir grades. 

All the septs are closely connected, however, by marriage ties, as all 
KdSrs are to a certain extent polygamous and marriage is prohibited 
within one's own dan or those of one's mother and father's mother. 
Nevertheless the sept always acts together as such without regard to 
the marriage ties. 

Each sf^pt has one or more chief men to represent it, but some of them 
are Hbsolutely without weight in the tribal councils. In tbe more im- 
portant septs these representatives are invariably jast or tribal head- 
men and they are generally so in the minor clans. 

Socially, a Kdfir clan, such as the K^m, is divided into the following 
grades : — 

1. The mirs and priest. 

2. The jant (elders or seniors), and ur jast. 

3. Members of important septs. 

4. Mt-mbers of very Bmall septs or gi-oups of families. 

5. Poor freemen, fatsas or shepherds. 

6. Slaves. 

The family is the unit of the Kd,fir body politic and the importance 
of a sept depends largely on the number of its families, just as the im- 
portance of a family depends on the number of its adult males. 

The head of the house is an autocrat in his own family, obeyed dur- 
ing life and honoured after dt-ath by his descendants. A son rarely 
opposes his father, though if hopeless of redress he may leave the clan 
and turn Muhammadan for a while. But occasionally a son will be 
supported by public opinion in a quarrel with his father, and in a case 
where a man ran away with his own daughter-in-law, his son obtained 
eight-fold compensation. The father's authority naturally weakens as 
he grows old and he is succeeded as head of the family by his eldest 
son (if not the son of a slave mother), but his authority over his brothers 
is not very great and only lasts until partition of the family property 
becomes inevitable. 

In spite of their social gradations the Kd,6r clans are in theory demo- 
cracies, but actually they are oligarchies and in some cases autocracies. 

No individual can achieve importance until he become a jast. 
Amongst the K4m to become a jast takes three years'^ and involves 
giving 21 feasts, 10 to the jast and 11 to the clan. Complicated cere- 
monies also have to be gone through. Little boys may become jast, 
though they will still be treated as boys. 

A jast wears a woman's coronetted earrings in tbe upper part of the 
ear and any gorgeous robes he can procure for religious ceremonies and 
dances. 

The feasts are most expensive and among the Kam many men utterly 
ruin themselves in becoming jast and praise themselves for having 
done so. To go through the ceremonies a man must have a female co- 
adjutor,t but she is usually not his wife because the cost of giving a

dancing boots and to take part in the dancing, when on the completion of all the formali- 
ties, there is a ceremonial dance at a particalar festiral. 



Kafir feasts, 42 8 

doable set of feasts would be too gi-eat. Two men therefore usually 
arrange for one to go through the rites with the other's wife as his com- 
panion and vice versa. 

The initiatory rites are sacrifices of bulls andhe-goats toGisb, and the 
animals are jealously scrutinised to see that they are up to standard. 
The meat is divided among the people wl;o carry it hrme. These 
special I- acrifices atihe shrine recur at intervals, but the great hlHUghter- 
inga take place at the feast-givei's own hous^, though on these occa- 
sions too oue or two goats aie offered at the bhrine of Gish. Here, too, 
the flesh is not eaten but taken home, only cli'iua cakes, clieese, salt and 
wine being consumed on the spot. At the feast-giver's house, however, 
flesh is eaten on certain days, but on others it is skewered together in 
great heaps or portions for the guests to carry home, bread ghi, etc., 
being partaken of at his house. 

The feasts given to ihejasts alone are called mezhom and as the guests 
are few in number, some he-goats and a bull suflice for a day's enter- 
tainment. The fenst-givers are known as kaneash and those who have 
already completed their virtuous work are called sunajina. 

Apart from the feasts, the kaneash undergo a complex ritual, which 
becomes more and more complex as the time approaclies when they 
may don the earrings. At the sanauknn observance the kaneash is 
• the simulacrum of a man in that he closely resembles one of the decked 
out etiigies ,' and Sir George Robertson thus desciibes the initiation of a 
priest which he was invited to witness : — 

" He had on a thick fetumpy turbun, having in front ei frinpe of cowrie fhells etrnng 
together with red glass bt-ads, and furnished with a tail. A pliinie-like bunch of juniper- 
cedar was stuck in the front of this strikinp head-dress, between the folds of tho cloth. 
Bis ears weie covered with a most complicated collection of earrings (.f all shapes and 
sizes. About his neck was a massive white metal necklace, brass bracelets rudely stamped 
with short lines and marks adoined his wrii-ts, while he had on his feet the ordinary 
dancing-boots with long tops, ending in a nvn-Jchor hair fringe. He wore a long blue 
cotton tunic, reaching nearly to his knees, and the curiously worked black and white 
nether garments made for these occaBions at Shal in the KonAr Valley. Perhaps the 
most striking part ot the costume Whs a Badakhshani silk robe of the usual gaudy pattern, 
which was thrown negligently across the shoulJers. In his hand was the dancing axe of 
his fathers. He was bur.mii.g with pride and delijiht at his own appearance. After a 
BhOrt interval, Utah (the kaiieosh) being unable to otBoiate as pru'St, a Jast st^pppd 
forward and acted as deputy. He bound a white cloth round bis brows, took off his boots, 
washed his hands, and began the night's procCfdings by the sacrifice <'f two immense 
billygoats, the largest I have pver seen, the size of young heifers. The sacrifice was con- 
ducted in the usual way with the customary Details. The special feattire of the ceremony 
was the dabbling of some of the blood on the forehead of Utah and on the forehead and 
legs of his son Marak, who, seated opposite his father, was still weak and ill, for he was 
Only just recovering from suiall-po.x. For the boy, this proceeding meant that he might 
thenceforth wear trou.sers. Besides the ordinary Hour, bicad, and ghi, placed by the rire 
ready for the eacrifice there were some nnocmous chnp&tis, aboc:t 15 inches in diameter, 
like thosf given to elephants in India. At this point thepe were lifted up. a ppr-g of 
blazing juniper-cedar thrust in the centre, and they were th-n solemnly circled ronnd 
Utah's head thrpe tim^s and made to tnncb bin Fhoulders, while the deputy prit st who 
handled them cried 'such' 'such! ' The sametbintr wastben d(.ne to the boy. Af er an in* 
terval for refreshn ent there was dancing ; but juht before tb^y commenced, a vi»itor from 
another villagt', Brayamiital, burnt foith into panegyrics upo.n I'tab and on his dfy.d 
father, and spoke of thf immense amouit of property which bad been expended On the 
feast. This fulsome flattery was rewarded according til custom by the prcKent of a lungi 
or turban cloth, which was taken fr< in the waist of the Imle boy, Utah's sOp, who whs 
•till suffering from the effects of small-pox. Q he fire was then taken awi.y and fcur or 
five visitor"- were provided with turban> and dancing boots, as well as scarves to wear over 
their shoalders or rousd the waist." 



424 Kafir magistrates. 

This double rite of initiation was followed by dancing, the first three 
dances being in lionour of Gisli, and the next to Imra, Dizane and other 
deities. The dancers included visitors as well as the initiate's sister 
and her daughter, the two latter being dressed in full dancing attire. 
The snnauJcmi was completed next day by ceremoniously changing the 
initiate's turban for a broad-brimmed crownless hat, into the front of 
which a sprig of juniper was thrust. This changing of the head-dress 
is called shara' ute. The kaneanh initiated early in February were con- 
sidered pure in their uniform which they wore till the spring, and the 
greatest care wag exercised to prevent their semi-sacred garments being 
defiled by dogs. 

A curious duty of a kaneash is to grow a miuiature field of wheat in 
the living-room of his house. With this no woman must have anything 
to do, and jt is remarkable as the only agricultural work done by the 
men. 

Just in front and to the east of the tiny field i;^ a flat stono and an 
iron tripod, on which lie pine sticks ready for lighting. The whole 
forms a miniature altar and before it is placed a stool with a flat piece 
of wood as a footstool. Every evening the kanea^'h goes through the 
following rite : — 

He seats himself on the stool and takes off bis boots, while some 
friends or relations light the fire, bring forward a wicker basket piled up 
with cedar branches, a wooden vessel containing water, a small wicker 
measure with a handful of wheat grain in it and a large carved wooden 
receptacle full of ghi. The kaneash, having washed his hands, 
assumes the crownless hat he must never be without except in his 
own house, and begins by burning and waving, about a cedar branch 
while he cries. Such ! such ! — ' be pure !' 

He thrusts this into the water vessel before him, and then burns 
a second branch completely, after waving it as before, and sprinkles it 
with the now holy water. 

He then proceeds to sprinkle the cedar branches, the fire, the ghi 
vessel. Next he piles cedar branches on the fire, with a few wheat 
o-rains and a handful of ghi, he begins his incantation while the 
flames are dancing merrily and the smoke rolling upwards in clouds. 
He pays tribute to all the gods in regular order, every now and then 
pausing to sprinkle and cast his offering on the fire, as at the begin- 
ning. 

The temperature of the room gradually grows terrific, for the ordinary 
house fire is blazing on the hearth all the time. The scene altogether 
is a strange one ; the wa.lls of the room are frequently adorned with 
grotesque figures painted in black on the clay-coloured ground. Thp 
sprig of cedar worn in front of the hat shows that the wearer is an 
ordinary notable who has become a jast. If he has gone through 
the ceremony before, he wears two sprigs of cedar. This is very rare 
indeiid. 

The ur or iirir jast is the chief of the ?<r or iirir, 13 magistrates who 
are all elected annually, the other 12 being merely his assistants. As 
a body it is their duty to regulate the amount of water which each 
cultivator is to get from the irrigation channels and to keep theni in 



Kafir customs. 425 

good order. Anothsr duty is to see that no one picks or eats walnuts 
or grapes before tlie appointed time — a rule relaxed in favour of 
guests. Disobedience is ])iinished by lines which are the urir^' per- 
quisite and the only remuneration thoy receive. The urir jant also acts 
as master of the ceremonies at all festivals and dances and has to light 
the fire at the gromvia every Wednesday (Agar) night. He is also the 
official entertainer of guests. The urlr are elpctod in the spring at the 
Durban festival, aftei* a bull has been sacrificed to Gish and some simple 
rites. The ur jast receives all the flour not nsed in sacrifices, and 
basketfuls of flour are also presented to him by the women on the last 
day of e^ch month. In return he has to feast all comers for several 
days on election, but on the whole his office is a lucrative one. It is 
interesting to note that slaves can be elected members of the urir 
provided they are not blacksmiths and are jast hari* i. e., skilled 
mechanics. Fines are imposed for making fua of the urir within 7 
days after their appointment. 

A form of adoption which is clearly akin to the milk-tie of Chitrdl is 
practise! in Kdfiristdn. A goat is killed, its kidneys removed and cooked 
at a fire. A K^fir then places the adoptive father and son side hy side 
and feeds them alternately with fragments of the kidneys on the point 
of a knife. At short intervals the pair turn their heads towards each 
other and go through the motion of kissing with their lips a foot or so 
apart. Then the adoptive father's left breast is uncovered, some butter 
placed upon it, and the adopted son applies his lips to it. Adoption 
of a brother is effected in precisely the same way, but the latter part 
of the rite is omitted. 

Murder, justifiable homicide and killing by inadvertence are all 
classed as one crime for which the penalty is an extremely heavy blood- 
ransom to the slain man's family, or exile combined with spoliation 
of the slayer's property. The slayer at once takes to flight and be- 
comes a chile (? chail] or outca^st, for his sept wall not aid him. His 
house is destroyed and confiscated by the victim's clan, and liis moveable 
property seized and distributed, even if it is held jointly with his rela- 
tives. Their separate property is, however, exempt, nor is his family 
deprived oP his land. The chile is not compelled to leave his tribe, but 
he must quit hia village and always avoid meeting any of the family 
or sent of the slain, though it suffices if he merely pretend to hide so 
that his face may not be looked upon. His sons, if not grown up, 
and his daugh'ers' husbands and their descendants, also become chiles, 
and even Muhammadan traders who have married daughters of chiles 
must behave like any other chile when they visit the slayer's villao-e. 
Several * cities of refuge ' are inhabited almost entirely by chiles, de- 
scendHuts of the slayers of fellow-tribesmen. The chief of these is Mer- 
grora. The shedding of blood may be atoned for by a heavy payment 
in cash or in kind, but the amount is uncertain as it is rarely paid. 
It is paid to be 400 Ktlbnli rupees, and if paid reflects so much honour 
on the slayer's family that its males are for ever afterwards permitted 
to carry about a particular kind of axe. 

* BaH ia a ilave and ja»t bari would appear to mean ' a jast among the lari. 



426 Kafir beliefs. 

Slaves (hari) form a curious and interesting class in Kdfiristdn. 
All the craftsmen, such as the carpenters, dagger-makers, iron-workers 
and weavers, are slaves, as are also those musicians who beat drums, but 
the skilled mechanics, wood-carvers, boot-makers and silver-workers 
are called yas^&ar*. Lowest of all are the blacksmiths. The slave 
artisans live in a particular part of the village, work for their masters 
with materials supplied them and get no wages; but if they work for 
others they are entitled to keep the pay. These slaves are entirely self- 
supporting. House slaves rank much higher than artisan slaves, live 
with their masters, and are not treated harshly. Slaves are so impure 
that they may not approach a god's shrine too closely nor enter a 
priest's house beyond the doorway. They are always liable to be given 
up to another tribe to be killed in atonement for a murder, as well as 
sold, and their children are their master's property. They are how- 
ever permitted, after giving certain feasts to the free community, to 
wear the eai rings of the jast, and this privilege exalts the wearer — at 
least anion » the slave community. Moreover a master and slave oc- 
casionally l3ecome adaptive brothers. Slaves adopt all the customs of 
the rest of the community, and give feasts at funerals and on other 
great occasions. Neither sex has any distinctive badge, but they are 
recognizable by their physiognomy, being low-browed, very dark- 
complexioned, but of powerful build. The bondsmen are just as pat- 
riotic as the rest of the community. There is but little traffic in slaves, 
as they are not sold unless their owner becomes very poor indeed ; but 
female children of slave parents are sold to the neighbouring Muham- 
mad an tribes, who are thereby enabled to make converts to IsMm. 
Children born to a K^fir by a slave mother would appear to be free, but 
of very low status. The slaves also are accorded a semi-divine origin, 
as the following narrative shows ; — 

" It appears that one day up in the sky a father blacksmith said to 
his son, * Bring me some fire.' Just as the lad was obeying the order, 
there was a lightening flash, and the boy fell through the slit thus 
caused in tbe floor of the sky on to the earth. From this youth one 
portion of the slave population is derived, the remainder being the 
offspring of Waiguli prisoners, taken in war. Of the Presun tbe 
following account was given me. In the beginning of the world God 
created a race of devils. He soon afterwards regretted having done so, 
but felt Himself unable to destroy all those He had so recently endowed 
with breath. But Moni (sometimes called Muhammad by Kdfirs, 
under the impression that prophet and Muhammad are synonymous 
terms) grieving at the terrible state cf afi'airs, at length obtained a 
sword from Imr^, and was pfiven permission to destroy all the devils. 
He killed very many, but seven, the ancestors of the Presuns of to-day, 
managed to escape him." 

Kafir theology divides the world into Urdesh, 'the world above,' the 
abode of tbe p<'ds : Michdesh, the earth ; and Yurdesh, the nether 
world. Both the heaven and hell for mortals are in Yurdesh, which is 
reached by a great pit, at whose mouth sits MaraKalik, the custcdian 
created by Imr^ for this duty. Be permits no one to return. At 
death a man's breath or soul (shon) enters a shadow form, such as we 
gee in dreams, and it then becomes a partir. The good appear to 



^afir marriage. 427 

wander about in Bisht, a paradise in Yurdesli, while the wicked burn 
in Zo-<iuk,-^ ' hell ' Kilfirs have no great fear of death, but suicide is 
to them inexplicable. 

Presungiil is pre-eminently a religious tract. Devils' villajres abound, 
the old warer-courses are believed to have been built by the deities ;' 
miraculous hand-prints are shown on rocks, and much reverence is paid 
to Imrd. ^ 

Ka6r marriaget is a very simple business, being indeed merely a 
bargain whereby the wife is purchased of her parents. When the price 
has been settled a goat is killed, tiierc is some feasting and the raarriao-e 
is completed. But the wife is not allowed to leave her parents' hou'se 
until the full price has been paid and girl-children born to her there 
would certainly belong to her family. It is not certain, however, if 
sona would not behng to the father. It is payment of the full pr'co 
which gives the husband a right to take his wife home to work in the 
fields. 

Girls are generally married before puberty and indeed infants are 
sometimes atfianced to grown men. A girl of 12 who is unmarried 
must be of hopelessly bad character. On the other hand, youno- aud 
even middle-aged women are sometimes married to boys, for an orphan 
lad who owns land must marry in order to get it cultivated. 

All well-to-do Kdfirs have more than one wife but rarelv more than 
4 or 5, and it. is a reproach to have only one wife. The price paid de- 
pends on the suitor's status, a poor man paying Rs. 8 and one fairly 
well-to-do, Ks. 1 2. A Kdfir takes over his dead brother's wives to 
keep or sell as he deems fit. Divorce is easy as a man can always sell 
a wife or send her away. When a woman elopes with another man the 
husband tries hard to get an enhanced price for her. 

"Women are regarded as chattels and can therefore hold no property 
even in themselves. Accordingly on a man's death his property is 
divided equally among his sons, but the eldest son gets a single article 
of vague such as a cow or a dancing robe over and above his share 
while the youngest inherits his fatliei-'s house. The inheritance is 
strictly confined to legitimate sons by free mothers, and slaves' sons "-et 
nothing. If there be only a very young son the brother would practi- 
cally do as lie chose with the property, provided he feasted the clan 
lavishly out of it. A son may also dispose of or even marry his 
stepmothers, and his mother too is often remnrried, her price probably 
going to her son. Failing near male agnates, the estate o-oos to 
the more remote and, failing them, to the sept. It never goes to 
daughters or to relatives by marriage as it might then go out of the 
clan altogether. 

Kdfir religion is described by Sir George Robertson as a somewhat 
low form of idolatry, mixed with ancestor worship and some traces of 
fire worship. The diflSculties of getting information were however o-reat

and in Pivsiingiil t.lie people objected to his being shown their gods 
at all. The principal gods and goddesses are : — 

9. Duzlii. 

10. Noiig. 

11. Parade. 

12. Shomde. 

13. Saranji or Sauranju"^ 

14. Dizane I „„j ■!„„„..» 

15. Nirmali [goddesses. 

16. Krijinai or Shumai J 

Irar^ is the creator. By his breath he created his ' prophets/ Moni, 
Gish, etc., but iJizane sprang from his right breast. Placing her on his 
palm Imra threw her violently upwards into a lake where she was hid. 
Bagisht alone was bom in mortal wise to Dizane.* Besides his prophets 
luirii also created seven daughters who watch over agriculture and as 
sowing-time approaches goats are sacrificed to them for ample crops. 
Imrc4 also created fairies and demons, but the latter gave so much 
ti'ouble that Moni had to be permitted to exterminate them. One he 
destroyed by secretly withdrawing seven screws or plugs from his body 
so that he fell to pieces. 

For the legends and myths which gather round Imra the reader 
must be referred to Sir G. Eobertsou\s book, but one deserves special 
notice. It relates how Inthr had made Badawan his resting-place and 
there created vineyards and ple^sanceSj but Imr^ suddenly claimed it 
as his. In the fight that ensued Imrd drove him from place to place 
until he had to abandon the Bashgul valley and take refuge in 
Tsarogul. 

Frequent sacrificest are made to Imra, sometimes for recovery from 
sickness, seasonable weather or other material benefits ; sometimes 
from motives of simple piety. He is not more honoured than the other 
gods at the religious dances, and though he receives three-rounds there 
is none of the enthusiasm which is displayed lor Gish. Possibly Irar^ 
was once chiefly worship[»ed and he probably still retains his ascendancy 
in Presungul, where his principal temple is found though he has 
temples in every village, and they are also met with far from any 
dwelling. In Presungul his great temple, at Kstitigrom, the most 
sacred village in all Kd,firistaD, is an iu)posing structure, elaborately 
ornamented. On its east side is a square portico, as spacious as the 
temple itself, supported on carved W()Oden pillars which form a kind 
of rough colonnade. The carving is of three tjpes, a fav('Urite one 
beintr two rows of rams' heads, one on each side of the pillar, ex- 
tending from top to base : another consists in an animal's head carved 
at the base from which the horns extend, crosbing and re crossing each 

• The birth of Bagisht happened in this wise : In a distant land in the middle of a lake 
grevf a large tree— so great that it would have taken 9 years to climb it and 18 to 
journey from one side of its spread to the other. Sataram became enamoured of it, but, 
■when he approached, it burst asimder disclosing Dizane and he fled in consternation. 
Di/.ane emerged and began to milk goats, but was ravished by a demon who had four 
eyes, two in front and two behind. To her was born Bagisht in a swift-flowing Presungul 
river whose waters parted to allow the child to step ashore unaided. On his way down 
the stream he met a stranger and learnt that he was named Bagisht. Another story is 
that Dixane was the trunk of the sacred tree and Nirmali its roots: the tree had seven 
branches, each a family of seven brothers. 

\ Cows are commonly sacrificed to Imra throughout Kafiristan.

other at intervals and onding in points, between which a grotesque face 
appears; and the third is the common basket, pattern. Under this 
portico many sacrifices are made. The effigies of Imrjlare in wood CJirved 
in rehef. The figures are about 7 feet hi^h and represent the god seated 
and working a goat-skin churn. The face of each is prodigious. The 
square-cut chin reaches Avithin a hand's breadth of the goat-skin on thu 
god's knee?. The brow and nose are, in the majority of tlie figures, 
scored witli lines, while those on the two practicable doors have rough 
iron bells suspended between tlip eyes. The goat-.skin churns are re- 
presented as carved all over. Above the faces of the images a large 
circular head-dress appears, with a horizontal line of carving across the 
middle, and vertical cuttings running upwards and downwards from it. 
Between several of the figures there are vertical rows of what; appear 
to be intended for cows' or rams' heads. 

From one of these lows the heads can be drawn out of their sockets, 
and the glories of the interior be partially disclosed. Above the big 
images is a board ornamented with small figures an-d horns. On the 
outer side of the temple, to the north, are five colossal wooden figures 
which help to support the roof. On the south side the ornamentation is 
almost entirely confined to the upper part of the wall, which consists of 
a series of carved panels. On the west there is little or no attempt at 
ornament of any kind. 

Moni ranks next to Imrd in the Kafir pantheon and is called ^the ' 
prophet. He always appears as the god selected to carry out 
Imr^'s behests. He has a temple in almost every village, and in 
Presungul, where he retains his rightful position, two small patches of 
glacier several miles apart are called his marks and said to be the 
places whf>ro ho stands to play aluts (quoits). Once Moni found 
himself in Zozuk (hell) and had to be rescued by an eao-lc. 

Gish or Great Gish is by far the most popular god of the Bashgul 
Kafirs and every village has one or more shrines dedicated to him.* 
Ho is the war-god and as a man was a typical Kafir. Sotnc say his 
earthly name was Yazid, and he is reported to have killed Ali, Hasan 
and Husain and nearly every famous Musalman known to the Kafirs. 
Countless bulls and he-goats are sacrificed to him, and for 15 days 
in spring slaves beat drums in his honour. 

To the east of Kdmdesh village is a very sacred spot with a temple 
to Gish, fitted with a door which is removed for a limited period each 
year. I^olcs project upwards from three of its corners and two of 
them are crowned with caps, one of iron, another of mail, the spoil 
of a foray; while the third is hung round with a bunch of rude, 
tongueless bells, which are carried about at some festival .t Itnmedi- 
ately facing this shrine is a similar, but .smaller, one dedicated to Moni, 
and this is occupied by three stones in a row, the middle and larn-est 
of which is worshipped as Moni. 

* One is templed to identify 'Sisa with Krishna who appears as Gisane in Arminian. But 
if Gifh be Krishna at all, he is clearly the elder Krishna. 

t This is also done in spring during the period while slaves beat drums iu his honour 
and for four additional days. They are then carried about by an inspired priest on three 
rings, 6" in diameter, three bolls on each ring. 



430 Kafir 'priests. 

During this period of spring alluded to above the door of the temple 
of Gish remains open, the door being replaced early in July. For 
10 days in September drums are beaten morning, noon and night in 
his honour. Every raid, in which an enemy has been successfully killed, 
terminates in the heroes of it dancing at the gromma in honour of 
Gish. Only male nnimals, !*uch as bulls and he-goats are offered to 
Gish. Certain smooth holes in rocks are often pointed out as his cannon. 
The god however appears to be less admired iu Presungul than he is 
among the Sidh-posb. 

Bao-isht is a popular deity who presides over rivers, lakes and 
fountains, and helps good men in the struggle for wealth and power. 
He appears to have no temples, but three celebrated places are the 
scenes of his worship and others are sacred to him. Sheep, and 
occasionally goats, are sacrificed to him. 

Arom* is the tutelary god of the Kdm Kafirs and his little shrine 
resembles one of the ordinary effigy pedestals. At the close of a war 
the animals which ratify the treaty are sacrificed at his shrine. 
He had seven brothers. When the time comes for the kaneash to cast 
aside their distinctive garments, a part of the ceremonial consists in 
sacrificino- a he-goat to Arom. Satardm or Sudaram is the weather 
god and regulates the rainfall. 

Dizane is a popular goddess and the Giche or new year festival is 
held entirely in her honour. She also has special observances during 
the Dizanedu holidays. She takes care of the wheat crop and to 
increase its culture simple offerings, without sacrifice, are made to 
hfr. In Presuno-ul a great irrigation channel is attributed to her and 
a o-ood bridge is called by her name. While the men are away on a 
raid the women dance and sing praises to the gods, especially to 
Dizane. Some say she was Satardm's daughter, and she may have been 
orio-inally the goddess of fruitfulness. She usually shares a shrine 
with other deitie**, but at Kdmdesh she has a pretty shrine, built by 
men brought from Presungul for the purpose. It has the wedge- 
shaped roof common in that tract and is covered with carving. The 
poles, which are fixed along both sides of the sloping roof, support 
wooden images of birds, said to be pigeons. 

Nirmali is the Kdfir Lucina, taking care of women and children and 
protecting lying-in women ; the pshars or women's retreats are under 
her special protection. 

Krumai lives on the sacred mountain of Tirich Mir and is honoured 
by a comical dance which always winds up the performances at the 
reo-ular ceremonies when each important deity is danced to in turn. 

The religious functionaries are the utah or high priest, the dehildla 
who chants the praises of the gods, and the psJmr, who is temporarily 
inspired during religious ceremonies and on other occasions. All the 
utiihs are greatly respected and in Presungul there is one to each 
villa'^e, some of the elders among them being men of great sanctity. 
All are wealthy and have certain privileges. An utah may not visit 
cemeteries, use certain paths which go near receptacles for the 
dead or enter a room where a death has occurred until the effigy has 
been erected. Slaves must no t approach his hearth. 

* For the ancient race of this name see p. 421. 



Kafir festivals. 431 

The dehildla is also debarred from using certain impure pathways. 
The pshurs appear to be more or Kss CDnscious impostors. 

The lianeash also are considered pure and can, at some sacrifices 
perform the Utah's duties. 

Festivals. — {{) The Gicho or new year's day is called the Kdfir Id 
by their Muhammadan neighbours and appears to fall about January 
16th. All men who have had sons born to them during tlie pn.st year 
sacrifice a goat to Dizane, and the night i.s spent in feasting. Early in 
the morning of the 17th torches of pinewood are deposited in a heap 
in front of the shrine of that goddess and the blaze is increased by 
throwing ghi on the fire. 

{il) The Veron follows about the 3rd February and the ?<nV enter- 
tain the whole village. It is quite a minor festival. 

(m) The Taska falls about February 18th. Small boys areencoarao-ed 
to abuse grown men and snowball fights take place. On the 20th there 
is a great dance in the afternoon at the gromma, attended by the 
kaneash in their robes and by all \he jast in gorgeous attire. Gish is 
principally honoured, and all the religious functionaries are also 
pro'^ent. In the evening a subdued revel called the jyracki ndt (dance) 
is held at the gromma, but only boys of the lower orders appear to 
indulge in it. 

The day following is devoted to throwing an iron ball, called shil. 
This is thrown by the young men and the victor has the privilege of 
feasting the village. The contest appears to be in honour of Imrd 
who made the ball when he created the world. 

{iv) The Mamma, falling about March 8th, is essentially a women's 
festival. On the preceding evening they cook rice and bread, small 
quantities of which are placed early on the 8th, with ghi and wine in 
front of the family eflBgies. Tlie offerings are then washed away by 
gushes of water from a goat-skin. The women next proceed to the 
jishar, where they feast and amuse themselves with loud laughter. 
On their way home they exchange indelicate chaff with the men who 
offer them necklets or other small articles to be danced for. JVear 
each house a small portion of prepared food is placed on the ground 
in the name of every deceased relative who can be rcnombored and 
this too is swept away by water. The food left over is then feasted on. 

[v) The Duban is the great festivity of the year, lastino-il days 
from about March 19th — 29th. It has an elaborate ceremonial, but 
its chief features are dancing, processions and the antics of the buffoon 
prie 

{vij The Azhindra, on April 6th, is solemnised by a procession to 
the upright stones which form the shrines of Bagisht and Duzhi 
The kaneash are allowed to leave the village for this occasion 
Games of aluts and foot-races are its principal features, but Bao-isht 
is also honoured by a bull sacrifice and recitations. ° 

{vii) The Diran, about May 9th, is a festival of purification. A 
regular procession goes to Imrd's tempi^, the priest sprinkling water

on its members with a sprig of juniper. A cow is sacrificed to 
Imr:'i, and baskets full of flour, with a bread-cake shaped like a rosette 
en top, are placed before the shiine. Then the assembly moves a 
little to the north, and a goat is sacrificed to Ba^isht at his distant 
shrine, the idea being that the sacrifice is offered through the air. 
A display of archery follows. 

[mii) The Gerdiilau falls about Juno 5th and appears to be of 
secondary importance. 

(ix) The Pcitilo, aV-out the 30th of June, is celebrated by picturesque 
dancing at night in honour of Imr^. 

{x) The Dizancdu, falling on July 9th, merits a full quotation of 
Sir George Robertson's account: *'For two days previously," he 
writes, "men and boys had been hurrying in from all sides bringing 
cheeses and ghi. Every 'pshal or dairy farm contributed. At two 
o'clock the male inhabitants of Kamdesh went to Dizane's shrine 
to sacrifice a couple of goats, and make offerings of portions of cheese 
and bread-cakes. 

Then the whole company returned to Gisli's temple. An immense 
pile of fine cheeses was heaped upon the wooden platform close by, and 
from each one a shallow circular fragment was cut out. The convex 
pieces were placed on the cpdar branches with bread-cakes and ghi 
during a regular worship of Gish. 

This ceremony over, the people collected into groups, scales were 
produced, and all the cheeses were cut into portions. Each share was 
weighed separately, the wake-weights being neatly skewered on to 
the big pieces with little bits of stick. While this was being done 
the goat's flesh, divided into "messes", was being cooked in two 
large vessel ?>, the green twigs used to bind together the different 
shares simmering away merrily with the meat. Women brought 
bread from the different houses, and ultimately stood in a row in the 
background, while their male relations thoroughly enjoyed themselves. 
There was a regular religions ceretoony performed by Utah, and just 
before this began, Shahru, the mad priest, at the invitation of the 
oldest of the Mirs, replaced the shutter which closed the tiny door 
or window of Gish's temple. This shutter bad remained on the top 
of the shrine ever since Shahru had removed it early in the year." 

[xi] The Munzilo, held about August 17th, appears to be mainly 
devoted to the final ceremonies for the kaneash. It lasts several days. 
Gish and Dizane are chiefly honoured. 

(aii) The Nilu festival begins late on the evening of September 17th, 
and on the 18th boys of 6 to 12, the only performers, collect about 
4 p.m. and are dressed in gala costumes. After they have 
danced, Imrii is worshipped, without a sacrifice, and a fireht. On the 
19th the men dance and songs are chanted in honour of Gish, Dizane 
and other deities. The proceedings close with a dance to Krumai. 

This is the last festival of the year. 



Kafir games. 43^ 

Birth customs. 
When delivery is imminent the woman goes to tlio Nirmali house* 
and remains there for 20 days if the child is a girl, or 21 if it is a 
boy. After a ceremonial ablution slie then returns home, but is 
allowed a further rest of 1 2 days there. The instant a child is born 
it is given to the mother to suckle and an old woman names all its 
ancestors or ancestresses, as the case may be, and stops the moment 
it begins to feed. The name on her lips wt that moment is the child's 
for lifo. ^. uckling continues fur two or three years. 

Boys may not wear trousers till they have been taken to Dixane's 
shrino at the Git he festival, dressed in that g'urb of manhood, and 
sacrifice has been made there. This is followed by a feast. The sons 
of poor men are often associated in this observance with boys who 
aie better off. Boys who take part in the sanaukav oi n. kaneash 
are exempt from further observances.t 

Ganie.s. — Games play an important part in Kdfir life. With one 
exception boys and girls play separately, the former playing rough 
games. One is played by lour boys on each side, each player holding 
a big toe with the opposite hand and hopping on the other foot. The 
object is to enahle I he 'back' to get through to the other side's 
goal. The game is played with wonderful pluck and good temper. 
Shooting arrow?, rough and tumble Gghling and pitciiing walnuts are 
the less violent amusements. Girls play at ball,, knuckle-bones (in 
which walnuts are however used) and swinging. The only game 
played by giils and boys together la an imitation of the national 
dance. Men play a kind of touch, in which the object is to tread 
on a, man's inslep to make him prisoner, archery, aluts, which is a 
kind of quoit, played with flat stones and various athletic exercises. 
The stone-bow is used by both men and boys jmd exactly resembles 
the Indian gultl. A fairly popular game is a kind of curling with 
walnuts on the house-tops. 

No game, liowever, plays so important a part as dancing. Kafirs 
dance when they are happy and when in mourning. They dance to 
' amuse ' the injured, the sick and the dyinis, but possibly this is really 
done as a form of supplication to the gods, who are propitiated by 
songs, dancings and feasting, which includes sacrifices, and never ii-. any 
other way. The chief occasions for dancing are the dances of the 
jast to the gi ds, those to the illustrious dead, tliose performed by the 
women to the gods while the men are raiiling, tliose of homicides to 
Gish, at a Kafir's death atid on the erection of cffiyies. These dances 
are performed insido the grommn or dancing-placo which is thus 
described by Sir G. Robertson : — 

"The dancing-place is always the most important spot in a Kafir 
village. There is usually only one, but K^mdesh and Bragamat;il 



* Or pshar. It is always placed on the outskirts of the village, or even outside it. and is 
a low, square apartment, in whose construction very little wood enters. In the Bashful 
valley it is also distingu itched by two or three sheep-skins fastened to a pole and stuck on the 
roof. Elsewhere it may be the merest hovel, half umlcrgrouud, yet incompletely sheltered. 
In Presungul the jjs/ior may be separated from the village by a river, but it is much better 
built and consists of two or three rooms in a line, the doors all facing the water, if it is on a 
river-bank ; and the sheep-skins are not in vogue.

484 Kdjir dances, 

have two eajh. A dancing-place should consist of a house to be 
used in winter an({ i)i bad weather, a boarded platform, and a level 
piece of ground, on which particular dances arc performed, furnished 
Avith a rude stonu altar. A description of the upper K^mdesh dancing- 
plncc will also apply, with some modifications, to all similar places 
in the Bashgul valley. 

The whole pLico is called the gromvia, a name evidently derived 
from the word qrom or hrom, the Bashgul terra for a village. A 
K^fir who had been to India with me always called the gromma the 
"church" when he spoke Urdu. To tho north of the Kdmdesh 
dancing-place is the gromvia or dancing-house. 

It is 12 feet high, 35 long and 30 broad. Its sides are barred, not 
closed, by heavy scpiare beams, between the intervals of which 
spectators can thrust their heads and shoulders restfuily. 

During a spectacle these apertures are generally crowded with 
the h a<ls of girls and women. Down the centre of the gromma run 
two rows <^i massive pillars which support the heavy roof. They 
are about six feet apart. The central four are quite plain, except at 
the top, where they are ornamented with carved horses' heads. The 
remaining four are completelv covered with the ordinary basket-work 
carving. In the middle of the roof there is a four feet square smoke- 
hole. Bordering the gromma to the south is the largfest level space in 
the village. It is about thirty yards square. On it there is a rude 
altar, formed of two upright stones, with a horizontal one on top. 
On this altar there is almost always to be seen the remains of a recent 
fire. To the east this space is continuous with a platform, which is 
carried out from the steep slope and maintained in that position by 
wooden pillars and beams. It looks, and is, a shaky structure. A 
railing runs round its three dangerous sides. Seats are provided on it 
in the shape of long planks of comfortable breadth, a few inches off the 
floor. These platforms are always to be seen if the village is built on 
the side of a hill. Most of the shrines at Kamdesh are provided with 
a platform which only differs from that at the gromma in point of size. 
In villages built on the flat, such as those in the upper part of the 
Bashgul valley, the platforms are lifted off the ground on trestles. 
They are indeed an essential part of every dancing-place, because 
certain ceremonies cannot be performed except upon them. 

The gromma of a Presun (Viron) village differs considerably from 
those of the Bdshgul valley. In the first place, they are nearly all of 
them half underground, that at Digrom, for example, is like a huge 
bear-pit and is reached by long passages sloping down from the vil- 
lage level. They are very large, as they are used for guest-houses, 
and are capable of holding a large number of people. In one corner 
they generally have a small shrine, containing a quaintly carved idol 
of some o-od. The four central pillars are hewn into marvellously 
grotesque figures, the huge shield-shaped faces of which are more 
than two feet in length. The arms are made to hang from the line of 
the brows, while, if a goddess is represented the long narrow breasts, 
which look like a pair of supplementary arms, start from between the 
aims and the brows. There is never any doubt, however, about the 
the sex of an ettigy of this kind. The knees of tho figure are made

tliey fouglit and conquered a pagan king of Si^lkot, nanifd Sain Pdl, 
who was, they say, probably a Dogra prince. On reaching Delhi they 
paid their respects to the king who ordered them to hold the Dhanni 
and the Salt Range on his behalf: under the leadersliip of Kahat, the son 
of Nawdb Ali, they accordingly retraced their steps to this district, and 
settled first at Gragnelpnr, of which the ruined site is shown in Mauza 
Wariamal near the foot of the Salt Rnnge : here they remained for 
some time, realising the revenue from the Janjuas of the hills and the 
Gujar graziers of the Dhanni, and remitting it to Delhi. The Mdirs 
and Kassars had not then arrived in these parts, but came six or seven 
generations afterwards. The eastern Dhanni was then a lake, which 
on the coming of Babar was drained at his command, the Kahuts taking 
part iu the work and colonising the land reclaimed. Chaudhri Sahnsar, 
8th in descen'j from Kahut, was their ancestor in the time of Bdbar. 

They have no peculiar customs, except that the males of the tribe 
never wear blue clothes, or, if they do, fall ill: this is ascribed to the 
vow of a sick ancestor. The tribe is not divided into clans. They in- 
tei marry to some extent with Mairs and Kassars, and now and then with 
Awdns, both giving and taking daughters : but usually marry Avithin 
the tribe.* The remarriage of widows is permitted, but is not custom- 
ary in good families: where it is allowed, it is not necessary that the 
widow should marry her deceased husband's brother. 

The mirdsis of the tribe give some of the usual rhymes : one relates 
to the passage of Bdbar through Kallar Kahdr. the first two lines being 
as given by the Kassar mirdsis, with the addition of a third, Kahut 
potre Abu Tnlah de awival a'e : but the latter does not hang well to- 
gether with what precedes it : the x\bii Td.lab referred to was the uncle 
of the Prophet. Another runs : Kahut charhia Dihlion sat mar naqdre : 
chdr hazdr hhird aur Jcainmi sdre : Kahut Dhoni surTchru hoid : sunnid 
chandal sdre. Dhond. is th.e name of a Kahut leader, they say. A 
third is a war song relating to fights of the Kahuts with the Janjuas. 

Like the Mdirs and Kassars they seem to have been ever violent and 
masterful, and to have retained their independence in a singular degree, 
but thouj^h they differ little in character and appearance from those 
tribes it is doubtful whether they are of the same stock. Though they 
may be regarded as Rajputs by status they do not appear to have ever 
claimed Rajput descent and indeed their bards claimed for them Mughal 
origin.

{TTE. TUESDAY, JANUARY 4 



THE KAYASTHAS. 



(from a correspondent.) 

The Kayastha conference met in Lahore 
last week, and some information about 
the Kayastbas may therefore be of interest. 
Kayasthas have been mentioned in the 
earliest literature of India. Their mythologi- 
cal origins have different phases and different 
interpretations according to the position of 
compilers as unfriendly or friendly sects. 

One portion is said to have descended 
from Chitragupta, a person who evolved out 
of the body of Brahma, another portion 
claims direct Kshatriya or warrior descent, 
compelled to follow the profession of the first 
section after the conquest of Parashuram, the 
enemy of the warriors, the son of Brahma 
by a warrior mother. People of the first 
section seem to have always followed the 
profession of writers, while those of the 
second wielded the sword as well as the 
pen. Historically it has been recorded that 
the second portion, which has all along been 
wearing the sacred thread, call themselves 
Ohandrasenyia Kayasth Prabhus. Ohandrasena 
was a king, which means Prabhu or lord, 
nd the Kayasth is said to be the fresh ap 
pellation derived from the fact that they were 
disarmed and made to work as scribes. 

But all these mythological or traditional 
origins can be easily rendered into possible facta 
simply by careful examination of the roots and 
derivations of their caste names. Mr. D. R. 
Bhandarkar and Rai Bahadur B. A. Gupta have 
shown that mc^ny of the caste-names of Hindus 
are originally territorial. Thu3 Deshasth means 
residents of the Desh (Deccan). Konkanasth 
means residents of the Konkan, and so 
Kayasth simply mean?? residents of the Kaya- 
Desh of the doab between the Ganges and the 
Jumna — the chief body {Kayo) of the Aryans 
who immigrated into India. 

In this way Chandraseniya may simply mean 
the threin, sept, or subdivision, which came 
from the valley of the Chandra alias Chinab 
through Kashmir, Kayasth, as is shown, may 
mean those who settled in the Kayadeeh, 
Dalabhyas may mean those who subsequently 



all sorts of Puranas to degrade them. But it 
seems clear that they are of the same stock ^ 
with the original Aryans, and have issued 'j 
out or branched off from the original body "I 
{Kaya) of the settlement called Kayadesh : 
after them. Those struggles have now under- i 
gone great change under the Pax Britannic*. ' 
Every caste is being treated with squal 
kindness and justice, and therefore the 
keenness of the feeling has abated, but there ' 
are ignorant and uneducated people who keep '• 
the tradition of the struggle with one sid«d ' 
interpretations. It is not only desirable in 
the present struggle for existence with power- 
ful outsiders possessed of terrific inventions 
for the destruction of their neighbours, 
that all the Kayasthas should bo united, 
but it is more important that Brahmans, 
Kshatriyas, and all other castes should unite 
in supporting the British administration 
which has given unbounded peace and progress 
to India. 

Under these circumstances it is futile to 
sift old myths and traditions from the 
origin and social position of people born of 
the same stock of immigrants. History speaks 
highly of the Kayasthas ; they produced rajas, 
ministers, administrators, judges, generals and 
accountants by hundreds, and will continue 
to do so in con junction with allied cistes. 



THE KAYASTHA CONFERENCE. 



The most noteworthy feature of the second 
day's sittings of the Conference was the 
presence of His Honour Sir Michael O'Dwyer 
and the Hon. Mr. J. C. Godley, Director of 
Public Instruction, the former receiving an 
ovation on arrival. His Honour spent nearly 
three quarters of an hour in listening to 
the speeches of Mr. Sarda Charan Mitra, late 
Judge of the Calcutta High Court, and 
Munshi Baldev Parshad of Bareilly, both of 
whom spoke on the need of writing a history 
of the Kayastha community. The last named 
gentleman described the chivalrous deeds of 
some of the distinguished leaders of the com- 
munity who occupied positions of trust under 
the Moghal Emperors and the British East 
India Company. Mr. Mitra condemned the 
action of anarchists in Bengal, especially of 
those who were Kayastha<^, and claimed that 
the community as a whole were the btst sup- 
porters of the British Government. Their 
Dh>irma enjoyed that next to God they owed 
their duty to the King. Among the resolu- 
tions adopted at the Conference were those 
for creating a National Reserve Fund of the 
community, higher education of boys, relaxa- 
tion of pardah among women, education of 
females, co operation with the Government and 
other communities and of thanks to the Lieute- 
nant-Governors of the U. P. and the Punjab.

Kajld — Kdkar, 487 

In the plains the Knyath or Kayasth is a caste— the well-known 
writer class o£ Hindustan, A full account of the caste and of its 
origins, which are fiercely disputed, would be beyond the scope of tliia 
article, but it may be noted that the Kayasthas say that they sprang 
from the body of Brahma who by virtue of his ascetic powers gave 
birth to a son named Chitril Gupta.* This son he bade go to Dluiram- 
puri, serve Yama R^ja, and uiake the people of the Avorld fulfil their 
karma. His desci^ndants are known as Kuyasthas or luiydka Stkdn.f 

By Rdja Manu's daughter Chitra Gupta had four sons, Mathar, Bhat- 
ndg-ar, Saksena and Sribastana. By Snsarman Rishi's daughter he 
had eight sons, Nigam, Anshat, Gaur, Karam, Rdlmfk, Un.iya, Kiil, 
JSursat and Suraj Dhaj. 'J'he 1 2 groups of the Kayasthas are named 
aftpr these 12 siuis. But all 12 arc not represented in the Punjab. In 
Jind for instance only four are found, viz., Mathar, Bhatmlgar, Saksena 
and SrivAstana. Asa rule they mix freely but in some places Srivds- 
tfina and Saksena do not smoke from the same hukka or eat kochchi rati 
together. They form one endogamous group. In Ji'nd they are chiefly 
of the Kashyab gotra, but some families belong to the Bhnts and one or 
two other gotras. In all the groups there are sub-groups (als) named 
after places, so t^iat there are 84 als in the 12 groups. Two ah, vix. 
those of the father and mother, are avoided in marriHge. 

Kareioa is never allowed and polygamy very rarely practised. 
Kayasttia marrying a female of a Jcvf or tribe below him in the social 
scale is usually excotumunicated. But the extreme step is not taken if 
ibe woman be of good iamily and he strictly abstains from eating 
kachchi roti prepared by her. Children born of such unions are married 
to persons of similar status. Marriages are generally performed at 
mature sge and great attention is paid to a boy's education. 

The Knyath is not indigenous in the Punjab, and is found in de- 
creasing numbers as we go westwards. He is only to be found in the 
admiuist^rative or commercial centres and is being rapidly displaced, so

Kakkezai,'^ a class of Muhammadan traders found all over India and as far 
west as Kandahiir. They claim to be by descent Afghd,ns of Seistd,n, 
sprang from Kakka, a son of Kam, and the nucleus of the class may 
well be a pure Pathd,n clan. But the sections of the Kakkezai include 
such ufimes as Bhursi, Malak, Kethaie, Kasoliya Shaikh, Vansare and 
Nakhasria, and^in Sialkot^ Bale, Bhaglrath, Ch^ndi, H4nda,t Khoria, 
Wadrath and Wanjotra, which hardly point to an Afghan origin and 
lend colour to the theory that the Kakkezai were, like the Khoja, Hindus 
converted at an early period of the Muhammadan invasions and affiliat- 
ed to a Pathan clan. A family at Pasrur in Si^lkot is called Mir Daha, 
and the ofiBce of that name at Bajwdra in Hoshid,rpur was held by a 
Kakkezai family in 1120 Hijri. In the Jullundur Do^b a branch of the 
Kakkezais, entitled Shaikhs, rose to eminence during Sikh times and 
even ^ave governors to Kashmir. The community is an influential 
and enterprising one in the Punjab.

them in other villages. They are called Kakuana, ami say they are 
not Kumhdrs, but Jdts, descended from one Kdku : and that they took 
to pot-making a few generations a,go. 

Kalal, (1) a Muhammadan J^t clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery 
and Multdn : (2) KaUl or Kardl, a class of very varying status and 
probably composite origin. The Kar^l claim Hindu E^jput ancestry 
and derive their name from Karauli, the State in Rd^jput^na. They are 
divided into 52 clans or gots including the Tulsi and Pital (in Kapur- 
thala). These Kardls are also styled Ahluw^lia, from Ahlu, a village 
in Lahore, and the Ahlu w alia sections are said to be: Tulsi, Phul 
Mali, Rekhi, Sad and Sej^-at. The Kardls are found in all the Districts 
of the Northern Punjab from Gujrat to Hoshidrpur, and are said to 
avoid widow remarriage. 

Tlie Kalal or Neb are also Hindus, but they more frequently em- 
brace Sikhism than the Karris. They are by profession distillers, and 
the word Kalal appears to be derived from kuldl, a potter.

Kaldn is its parent village, and it is also the parent village of ]2 
Killhir villages east of the Jumna, of J 2 across the Ganges in Moriddbad 
and of 17 villages in Auibcila. The Kalhirs are divided into two clans' 
or beong, Mandhan and Turka which cannot intermarry. Mandhan was

Originally tbey came from Ajudhya, first migrating toParaaktoda in the 
Dakhan or Malwa, and afterwards to Dardrehra in Jaipur. 



440 i^e KaUioras. 

Kalhoea or Saeai, originally a Jdt tribe, also known as Doddi Lati,* which 
gave a dynasty to Sind and is still represented in Dera Gbdzi KhSn. 
Its ancestors were darwesJtes or religious mendicants who followed the 
tenets of the Sayyid Muliammad, the Junpuri, a noted teacher, and 
one oF them, Harmus, espoused a daughter of the Abara Jdts of Sind, 
receiving a grant of land as her dower. His son or grandson. Shaikh 
Nasir, Hnd his son Shaikh Din Muhammad established their temporal 
and spiritual authority over the Abara territory in Upper Sind. His 
brother Yd-r Muhammad threw off all allegiance to the Mughals, seized 
the Siwistdn sarkdr of Thatha, the Siwi mahdll of Bakhar in the 
Mult^n Province, and Dili^r, and wrested the title of Khuddyar from 
the Mughal authorities.t His descendant Nur Muhammad drove the 
Dd,udpotr}is out of the zaminddri of Lakkhi, in the Bakhar mahdll.X 
In 1736-37 the Lati Khan, Khuddydr,§ received the province of Thatha, 
together with the southern part of the Bakhar sarkdr, but two or three 
years later he was stripped of two-thirds of his territory by Nadir Shah. 
After Nadir Shdh^s death howuver the Khudilyar assumed authority 
over all Sind, under the nominal suzeraignty of the Durrdnis, but their 
rule was short-lived. Nur Muhammad Kalhora was succeeded on his 
death in 1762 by his son Muhammad Murad, but he only ruled for 6ve 
years and was deposed by the Tdlpur Baloch, who set up his brother 
Midn Ghulam Shah (1757-5b). An attempt by his brother Attdr Khdn 
to regain Sind, under the authority of a Durrdni grant, failed, || Ghuldm 
Shdh died in 1771, while superintending the erection of the fortress of 
Haidard,bad in Sindh, after a stormy reign of 15 years. He had in 
1758 allowed the East India Company to establish a factory in Smdh, 
but Sarfardz Khd,n, his son and successor, cancelled the permit in 1775. 
A year previously he had caused Bahrdm Khdn, head of the I'dlpurs, 
and one of his sons to be assassinated, and this led his dethronement, in 
or about 1786. 



* Lati is said to be derived from the Hindui lat, ' tangled or clotted hair,' and kalhorah 
in Sindhi is said to bear the same meaning. A derivation from lat, a ' clnb ' in Sindhi, has 
also been suggested, and in front of the Kalhora chief's tomb al Khadi-abid a number of 
clubs are suspended. 

I According to the Dera Ghazi Khan Oazetfeer^ p. 23, Yar Muhamftiad aided by the Khan 
of Kalat defeated the governor of Sevi about 170U. After establishing himself in Northern 
Bindh, he made his formal submission to Jahaudar Shah on his succession to the throne of 
Delhi and was invested with the title of Nawdh, and the governorship of Sevi. 

J And socn came into contact with the Mirranis, ihid. p. 23. 

§ The title Khudayar appears to have been hereditary, or to have been beBtowed upon 
the wanaobiidr or office-holder for the time being by the Mughals But according to the 
Dera Gh»zi Khan Gatetteey (p. 24-) Niir Muhammad submitted to Ahmad Shah Durrani on 
Nadir Shah's assassination and received from him the title of Shah Nawaz Khin. A year 
or two later however he rebelled and was driven into Jaisalmer. 

II According to 8hah4mat Ali {Picturesque Shetcheg in Ind<d) Attar Khin was sent, along 
with a force by Ahmad Shah and on his arrival at Shikarpur Miin Ghulam Shah fled, but 
he was supported by the Abbissi family, rulers of Bahawalpur, and he and another brother 
Ahmady^r defeated Attir Khan. The latter obtained a second force from Ahmad Shah, and 
the brothers then divided their territories, Ghulam Shih taking Thatha, and Attar Khuda-abad 
and Ahmadabad. Attar was however soon dispossessed again and settled at Ikhtiyar Khan 
whence he made several more atiempts to oust Ghulam Shah. The story given in the Dera 
Ghazi Khan (Tozef^per that Mahmnd Shah Gujar helped Ghulam Shah to re-establish the 
Kalhora power at Dera Ghazi Khan is probably incorrect. The other version, that he was 
opposed by Mahmud Shah and also by the Ghdzi Khan is more probable. That Ahmad 
Shah despatched Kaura Mai, governor of Multan, against the Kalhora in 1758 is also likely, 
but his defeat by Kaura Mai, if it ever occurred, cannot have been severe, for in 1769 
Ghul£m Shih finally broke the Mirrani power after taking D«ra Ghizi Khan. 



Kdliar — Kalydr. 441 

The name Sarai or Serai is borne by the notable Kalhora family of 
Hdjipur in the Jdrapur tahsil of Deia Ghazi Kh^n. For an account of 
itreferpnce must be made to the DeraGlu'izi Khan Gazetteer, pp. 91 — 94, 
but it should be noted that the statement therein made that the Daud- 
potras are descended from Jam Jnnjar and therefore akin to the 
Kalhorasis repudiated by the Abbassi or Daudpotra tribe, though it was 
accepted by Ravert}'. 
Kaliar, a sept of Rajputs, found at Pduipat. Its family saint, Kald, Say y id, 
is a great worker of miracles, and anyone sleeping near his shrine 
must lie on the ground or he will be bitten by a snake. But if a snake 
bite a man on a Kaliar's ground he will suffer no harm.

Kalmat, -I. — A Baloch tribe. Formerly of great importance, the Kalmats 
fought with the Harris. Dames describes them as a Levitical tribe, 
probably non-Baloch. They are now found at P^sni in Mekrdn and in 
Sindh. The name is probably derived from Khalmat in Mekrdti, the 
connection with the Karmati (,the Karmatian heretics of Elliot's History 
of India) being doubtful.

442 Kdma—'Kamboh. 

Kama. — (1) A man, generally of low-caste, who has brought himself and 
even his descendants for several generations under obligation to serve a 
land-holder on account of debt, the service being rendered in lieu of the 
interest while the principal remained as a perpetual debt. This condi- 
tion of service still exists in Chamba, though more or less secretly, as it is 
contrary to the State law, and also in Kullu in spite of the law. It pro- 
bably exists all through the hills. (2) The hdma of the plains is a field 
labourer. 

Kamalia, Kambalia : see Gadaria. In Karn^l Muhammadan J^ts who have 
taken to blanket weaving are also called Kamalias and are said to 
marry only among themselves. Bat the Hiudu Kamalias appear to be 
all Gadarias in fact. 

Kamachi, a small tribe of vagrant minstrels, apparently akin to the 
Mirdsis. 

Kamalzai, one of the four main divisions of the Mandanr branch of the 
Khakhai (Khashi) Path^ns, The Kamd,lzai and Amazai, another branch, 
are found in Marddn and the Razzar in Peshawar. 

Kamangak, Kamagar, a bow-maker. With Lim may be classed the tir-gar 
or arrow-maker, and possibly the jpharera, but the latter appears to be 
merely the hill name for the rang-sdzj^ The Kamagar, as he is com- 
monly called, is chiefly found in towns and cantonments and, except in 
Kd,ngra, is always a Muhammadan. Now that bows are only made 
for presentation the Kamagar has taken to wood decoration in general. 
Any colour or lacquer that can be put on in a lathe is generally applied 
by the Kharddi, but flat or uneven surfaces are decorated either by the 
Kamangar or by the rangsaz, the former doing the finer sorts of work. 
The Kamangar does not form a distinct caste, but is professionally 
inferior to the Tarkhan or rangsdz, though he belongs to the Tarkh^n 
caste. 

Kambalia. See Gadaria. 

Kamboh. — (1) The Kamboh is one of the finest cultivating castes in the 
Punjab. They seldom engage in market-gardening, but ihey are no 
less industrious and skilful than the Arains. They are found in the 
upper Sutlej valley as low down as Montgomery, throughout the 
northern portion of the eastern plains, and as low down the Jumna 
valley as Karn^l. They are especially numerous in Kapurthala. The 
Jumna Kambohs seem to have come into the valley from the west, and 
there has lately been a very large influx of Kambohs from the northern 
tracts of Pati^la into the great dhdk jungles between Thd,nesar and the 
river. The Sutlej Kambohs of Montgomery are divided into two 
branches, one of which came up theriver from the Multan country 
(whence they aro called lammawdlas, fr. lamma, 'west') and the other 
down the valley from the neighbourhood of Kapurthala (whence they 
are called tappaivdla, from tappa, said to be the region between the 
Be^s and Sutlej), both movements having taken place under the Sikh

Kamhoh origins, 448 

rule. Under that rule they also came mtoJuUundur fro tu Kapurthala* 
They claim descent from Rija Karan, and say that their ancestor fled 
to Kashmir. The Kambohs of Bijnor also trace their origin to the 
trans-Indus country, and Mr. Purser accepts this tradition as evidently 
true. They are said l>y some to be ancient inhabitants of Persia, and 
the Karnal Kambohs trace their origin from Garh Ghazni; but the 
fact that 40 per cent, of them are Hindus and 23 per cent. Sikhs is 
conclusive against their having had any extra-Indian origin, unless at 
a very remote period. Arains and Kambohs are commonly supposed to 
be closely related : indeed in Montgomery a man appears to be called 
Ard,in if he is Musalm^in and Kamboh if Hindu.t But that this is not 
always the case is evident, from the fact of a vety considerable propor- 
tion of the Kambohs of Amritsar, Lahore, Ferozepur, Patidla, N^bha, 
and Maler Kotla having returned themselves as Musalmans, althoug^h 
Musalman Arafns are also numerous in those tracts. In Jullundur the 
village of Bhaiowdl is owned partly by Kambohs and partly by Arains, 
both being Musalman. It is perhaps doubtful whether the supposed 
relationship has any further basis than the fact that they both came 
from the west, and are both of much the same social standing and 
agricultural repute. It is highly probable that the nucleus of the 
Arain caste was a group of Hindu Kambohs converted to Isldm. Thus 
in Jullundnr the Gaure, Hdnde and Monii clans are found in both 
castes, and in Montgomery several of their clan names are identical. 
It is said by some that the chief distinction is tliat the Kambohs take 
money for their daughters, while the Arains do not. But the social 
standing of the Kamboh is on the whole superior to that of the Ardin, 
and very markedly so where the latter is a vegetable-grower. The 
Kamboh, moreover, is not a mere agriculturist. He not infrequently 
engages in trade, and even takes service in the army or in offices or 
even as a private servant, while his wife not infrequently lends money 
even where he is a mere husbandman ; and under Akbar a Kamboh 
general called Sh^hbaz Khdn commanded 5,000 men and distinguished 
himself greatly in Bengal. J Musalmdn Kambohs held Sohna'^in Gur- '^ 
gaon some centuries ago; and the tombs and mosques thatthey have left 
show that they must have enjoyed a considerable position. The- mili- 
tary, mercantile, and clerkly Kambohs are said to be distinguished as 
Qalmi or "men of the pen," and not to intermarry with the agricultural 
or Khaki section of the caste. But this is probably a mere social cus- 
tom and not a caste rule. The Kambohs do not seem to bear as high a 

* The Kamboh villages in Jullundur are clustered together in Nakodar tashil in the 
extreme south-west on the Kapiirthalu borJer. Tradition says that in lOol A. D. the 
Punjab was devastated by floods, so Jahangir sent Slier Shah, a Suba, to restore it and he 
brought with him from Sunam in fatiala (Mr. Parser thought this possibly a mistake for 
Sohna, a former Kamboh stronghold in Gurtraon) two men, Achhra, whom he located near 
Chunian in Lahore, and Rath whom he settled near Sultanpur in Kapurthala where the 
Kambohs founded a bdm or group of 12 villages. 

The Kambohs of Phillaur though few merit special notice. They claim to be Surajbausi 
R4j puts who came from Kamriip (Assam) on the Brahmaputra to Delhi in Hum^yuns 
time. Thence Bohd Rai migrated to Lahore and Daia Rai to Jullundur. This may be a 
poetical way of saying that Shahbaz Khan's career in Bengal raised his family to Rajput 
status. 

t In Multan, where the Kambohs are poor and unimportant, they often cultivate vegetables 
and those so occupied are not uncommonly called Arafns by the people.

444 Kamhoh etymologies. 

character for honesty as they do for skill. There is a Persian proverb 
current in the United Provinces : " The Afghans, the Kambohs, and the 
Kashmiris ; all three are rogues [hadzdt]," and in Karndl Mr. Benton 
described thera as " notoriously deceitful and treacherous," On the other 
hand Sardar Gurdidl Sin^'li states, it is not known on what authority 
that " during the reign of terror io India, it was the Kambohs who were 
trusted by the rich bankers for carrying their cash in the disguise of 
faqirs." The Kambohs are said to be exceptionally numerous in 
Meerut. Their location under the hills lends some slight support to 
their tradition of origin from Kashmir. 

The Kambohs are not very numerous in the State oi Bahawalpur, 
but they offer some points of interest. The Hindu Kambohs 150 
years ago, occupied JhuUan, a village on the right bank of the Sutle] 
not far from Pdkpattan. Being oppressed they migrated and founded 
JhuUan, a village in Karddri Minchindbad. Jhullan was a Bodla faqir 
to whom they paid special reverence and after whom they named their 
villages, and his descendant Ihsau Ali is still greatly revered by the 
Hindus. The Kambohs say they oiiginally came from Amritsar and 
that thf^y and the Ardins have a common origin. The Arains, who are 
scattered all over the State, claim Rajput origin, and say their old head- 
qaarters was Uch, whence they migrated to the Ravi and the Ghaggar. 

Some popular accounts of the origin of the name Kamboh follow : — 

(1) Once a powerful Raja, of the Solar race, whose capital was at Ajudhia, marched 
Iheiice to Derat and having killed Parmar, its Rsija, toolc possession of his kingdom. He 
founded Warangar and his son founded another town, which he named Dejapur, and the 
cities of Lambni and Gajni. The latter was his capital, and lay near the city of Kambay, 
the peninsula south of Guzerat. At the Solono festival when he was performing religious 
rites he was attacked by an enemy who had conspired with his pnrohtt, his city was 
plundered and its people massacred. Of those who escaped some fled to SAmana along the 
Ghaggar, passmg by Jaipur and Sirhind on their way, thence spread over the country 
between the Jumna and the Sutlej, and after wandering through the country watered by the 
Sullej and Beas scattered over the Avhole Punjab. Others reached Multan via Sind and 
thence spread into Montgomery. They are called Kambohs because they came from Gajni, 
near Kambay. Others assert that the name is a corruption of ka?nbudh (men of little 
intellect) because they did not take up arms on the Solono day, but preferred to die. 

(2) Raja ?odakhsh of Kamboj of the 8olar race and a descendant of the god Chander 
Burman sided with the Kauravas in their fight Avith the Pandavas. He perished with nearly 
all his men in the battlefield, and those who escaped settled in Ndbha and came to be called 
Kamboj i whence Kamboh. 

(3) Kamboh is said to be compounded of Kai and anboh, and the tribe is said to be de- 
scended from the Kai dynasty of Persia, to which the emperors Kaikaus, Kaikhusro, Kaikubad, 
Kai-Lehrashab and Darius all belonged. When they migrated to the Punjab they came 
to be called Kai-ambohs or Kambohas. 

(4) Hazrat AbduUa, son of Zuber, was sent with a large army to conquer Persia, where 
he settled nnd built many huts on the banks of the river. The Persians could not under- 
stand their tongue (Arabic), so they became kam-go or taciturn. Zuber's army comprised 
men of many beliefs. In time their settlements were destroyed and the ' Karagos ' fled. 

The first story is the one naturally favoured by the Kambohs themselves and the fact re. 
mains that the Solono festival is not observed by them, because they regard it as inaus- 
picious. The author of the Alna Tdrikhndira and Our Tirath Sangra has given an 
account of the Kambohs and assigns their origin to the Kambojas, but against this it may be 
urged that the Kambohs — 

(i) do not observe the Salono or tie the rakhri on it : 
(^ii) at the p/iem their parohits proclaim Garli Gajni or Ghaggar Has as their original 

home : 
(Hi) that their gots correspond with those of the Brahmans and Chhatris : 
(iv) that they perform the parojan or bamihau ceremony : 
(v) that they worship weapons at the Dasehra and wear them at \veddings j and 
(vi) that they cut the jand tree and sacrifice a he-goat at a marriage. 



Kamhoh groups, 445 

The only point which nierita notice in these folk-etymologies is the 
allusion to Sodaksli (Sudakshina), king of Kdmbojn, a territory which 
lay unde^r the hills, which now form the northern border of tho 
Attock and Rawalpindi Districts, from the Indus to the Jhelura. That 
kini;-, according to the Mahdhharata, joined the Kauravas with an army 
containing Yavaims and Shakas. But Kdmboja al.'^o app^-ars to have 
been the name of a tribe. These facts are in accord with the tradition 
that the Kambohs came from Kashmir, but bejond that there is abso- 
lutely nothing but the resen\blance in the names to enable us to identify 
the Kambohs with the KdrL-boja?. How their gots can be said to 
correspond with those of the Brahmans or Chhatris is not clear. The 
Kambohs have very few Jai-ge sub -divisions. The cine largest are — 
Dahut, Jaura, Sande, Jammiin, Jhande, Thind, Jauean, Mabrok, Umn4l. 

The Kamboha are by religion Hindu, especially in the east, Sikh, 
especially in the Sikh Districts, while some are Jain, and a great many 
are Muhammadans. The latter are in Lahore described as hardly dis- 
tinguishable from the Ardins, but the Sikh Kamboh is better than 
either, being equal to the Arilin in industry, but more enterprising and 
more provident. He matches the Arain as a market gardener and is 
not inferior to the Sidhu Jdt in general farming though he is smaller 
in physique and less intelligent than the J^^, The Sikh Kambohs in 
the Chendb Colony numbered over 10,000 in 1904. 

The Hindu Kambohs wear no janeo and do not purify the chaukd. 
Their women wear the gown and formerly wore no nose-ring. Widow 
remarriage is allowed. 

The Kambolis of Montgomery, who are almost without exception 
Hindus, affect the cult of Bhuman Shah, an Udasi faqir whose shrine 
is at the village of that name in Dipdlpur tahsil. He is said to have 
lived from 1687 to 1756 and was himself a Kamboh. He is looked 
upon as a patron saint. 

Hindu, Sikh and Jain Kambohs avoid 3 gots in marriage, the Muham- 
madans only one. The Hindu Dhat Kambohs perform the first tonsure 
under a dhdh tree and the J ham got at a Babji's shrine iu Lahore. 
The Kambohs reverence Sultan and Bhairon. 

The Muhammadan Kambohs have two groups : — 

(i). Bdwan-gota,*^ i.e., 52 gots. 

(ii). Chaurdisi-gota, i.e., 84 gots. 

These groups do not intermarry or smoke with Hindu Kambohs, 
though they arc said to be of tho same origin (as the Hindus?). It is 
«aid that when Garh Gajni was destroyed a Chaur^si Kamboh took 
refuge with a bard named Kamdchi and so the ancestor of the Bd,wan- 
gote severed all connection with him. 

The Karndl account is that the Kamboh first settled in Lalachi, now 
in Pati^la, whence they founded 32 villages. The Lalachi Kamboha 
claim to be Biiwan-gotas. A section of these Kambohs embraced IsUm 
only under Jahangir, and hence the mass of the Bdwan-gotas became 
Muhammadans, while the bulk of the Chaurdsi-gotas remained Hindus. 



* The Bawan-gota gots will be found in the Appendix. 



446 Kamerd — Kanauri. 

The two most important centres of the Bdwan-gotas are Sanaur and 
Sun^m in PatidUi. The ' 52 ' are in their own estimation superior to 
the ' S4i'gotasJ The latter are found in the Banur and Thuri (? Dhnri) 
ildqas of Patiala, in Maler Kotla_, Ndbha, the Nard,ingarh tahsil of 
Ambd,la and in ^ah^ranpur east of the Jumna; also in Amritsar, 
Multd,n, Montgomery and Lahore. A note from AmMla makes the 
* 52-groias' descendants of a cadet branch and the ' S4i-gotas' of an 
elder branch. 

The Kambohs follow many occupations, as confectioners, retail 
dealers, etc., as well as cultivators. As agents to bankers they are 
much trusted. (2) an Arain clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery,

Kanauri, Kanawari,* an inhabitant of Kanaur, the valley which, lying 
on the Upper Sutlej, forma an appanage of the Bashahr State. 
Its inhabitants are almost entirely Kanets or Jdds, but differ as com- 
pletely from the Kanets of Bashahr proper as do the Ldhula Kanets 
Irom those of Kullu. 

Besides the Kanets or Jads the only two castes in Kanaur are the 
Ch^mang.t who make shoes and weave, and the Domang,J who are 
blacksmiths and carpenters. 

Water or cooked food which has been touched by the lower castes is 
not used by Kanets, nor are people of these castes allowed to enter a 
Kanet's house. If a Kauet eat such food inadvertently he applies to his 
Rd,jd who bids him make expiation (prdyaschitta) and pay some 
nazrdna or forfeit. This custom is called sajeran or sacheran. 

The Kanets of Kanaur are said to be divided into three grades, each 
comprising a number of septs, whose names do not appear among the 
Kanets of Bashahr proper.

In the Kanaur valley Buddhism is the dominant faith, but though 
the social customs of the people generally resemble those of the Hindus, 
the observances bear Tibetan names, and the ritual is conducted in that 
language. 

Birth customs. 

During pregnancy the foili)wing chant is sung : — ' goddess Tflr^, I 
bow down to thee, be pleased to bestow on this woman thy choicest 
blessings.' And a charm written on a bit of paper or birch-tree bark 
is tied round the woman's neck. 

On the birth of a son the goddess Dolm^ is adored, and the chant 
called Bhum chung, which runs : Om tdyathd gate gate pdrd gate 
swdhds {' May God bless the child ') is sung. The old women of the 



448 Kanaur customs, 

family perform the midwife's functions ; and for a fortnight the mother 
lives apart, being debarred from touching anything. At the end of 
that period she and all she possesses are sprinkled with cow's ui'ine mixed 
with Ganges water, as among Hindus. The child's horoscope is cast 
by a Idraa, who also names the child when it is 15 days old, or on any 
ether auspicious day. It is generally brought out of the house for the 
first time at the full moon and, if possible, at an auspicious moment, 
when one or two months old. Charms for its long life are also made 
by the lamas. ^ 

A boy's head is shaved when one year old, the himas performing a 
horn,* pujci, or path sacrifice. As the Kanauris only rank as Shudras, 
they are not entitled to wear the sacred thread, so they wear instead a 
kanthif or necklace from the age of 8. 

Marriage customs. 

The marriage customs in Kanaur resemble those of the Tibetans. 
Brothers marry a joint wife, the lamas solemnizing the wedding by chant- 
ino" certain hymns and worshipping the gods or goddesses, goats also 
being sacrificed. 

The nuptial rites in Kanaur are peculiar. In the first place the 
amount of the dheri is unusually high, varying from Rs. 100 to 
Rs. 1,000. t The custom as to dower is also different. Many people 
give the bride as many pewter vessels as there are in the bridegroom's 
family, but ornaments, he-goats, cows, etc., are also given. The wed- 
ding is thus solemnized : — 

One of the brothers, most usually the one who is the bride's equal in 
age, o-oes with some of his relatives to her father's house on the day 
fixed by the Idvia (priest). There the party are well entertained, and 
the lama solemnizes the wedding by reciting some chants in Tibetan 
after the Tibetan manner. Next day they return to their own house 
with the bride richly dressed and adorned. On reaching home the 
bride is made welcome, especially by her mothnr-in-law. After a 
religious ceremony, the bride's ris:ht hand is held by all the bridegroom's 
brothers, and then all of them are deemed to have married her. A feast 
is then given to all who are present, and the lamas and musicians are 
fee'd. This marriage is a valid one. The child of an unmarried girl 
is called fuglang (bastard), and has no right to anything by way of in- 
heritance. Such children live by service and raar^ with some one of 
their own class, i.e., with a puglang or puglahch. 

In case all the brothers have only one joint wife, there can be 
no question as to the right of inheritance. And just as the bride's 

* Horn is a rite in which flames are fed with clarified butter mixed with barley and 
eesamum seed ; if possible almonds and dried grapes are also mixed in it. Pujn is an 
offering to the deity of a lamp fed with butter, water, flowers, sweetmeats, fruit, etc., 
while vdth consists in reading or reciting the Tibetan scripture called Chhas or Chhoss. 

t The fcanf/iiis an ordinary necklacp made of <ulst, the holy basil (Oft/mum sacrum). 
These kanthis are generally made in tiardwar, Bindraban, Ajudhya and Benares. 

1 The diieri prevents a woman's going to another man, as Only he who takes on him- 
self the responsibility for it is entitled to keep the woman. It is a sum paid to the bride'a 
guardian by those of the bridegroom, and must be refunded to the latter if the marriage 
turns out badly, e.g., if the wife leave her husband and go off with another man, ha has to 
refund the amount to them. 

S The wife is often older than her husbands, or than some of them, and her age, especial- 
ly if coupled with a sharp tongue, gives her a decisive voice in the family councils. 



Kanaur death-rites. 449 

mother-in-law is mistress of the family, so on her death the wife 
succeeds as its mistress. Thus tho movable and iramovablo property 
of a family remains in its joinb possess on an! is never divided. But 
the custom of polyandry is now dying out by degrees. 

Death customs. 

As the trade and wealth of Kanaur increase and its people come more 
in contact with India, they are rapidly abandoning the old customs, such 
&s diibant {drowning) , phulcant (burning), bkaJchant (eating), etc. This 
last method of disposing of a dead body was formerly observed only by 
the inhabitants of Hangrang ghori who are called by the Kanaur is 
Ny^m, and by the Kochi or Pahdri people, Zar or Jtlr, Zad or JSd. 

The lamas used to consult their scriptures and advise as to the 
disposal of the dead according fto the time, etc., of the death, but now 
tho Hindu shradhs, and so on, are obsprved. The only old custom which 
survives is the annual shrddh called phulaich* in which a lie-o-oat, 
reared in the dead man's name, is dressed in his clothes, t^acrificed and 
eaten by the members of his kindred. 

At a death-bed, grain is distributed among all those present, and the 
lamas read from Buddhist writings. The body is burnt on the same 
day, or at latest on the next. Drumss, sandis, karndlsf and conches 
are played when the corpse is carried to the burning-ground. Some of 
the bones are picked up, and sent either to Mdnasarowar in Tibet, to 
Raw^Isar in Mandi State, or to the Ganges. J In the deceased's room 
a lamp is kept burning for seven days from the death, and incense is 
also burnt in it. The chholpa (Hind, kiria harm) is performed frotu the 
eighth to the tenth day ; all the deceased's clothes are given to the 
lamas, with other gifts. The pancliaka or group of five constellations§ 
is inauspicious for the family of one who dies under it, and to avert the 
evil, images of roasted flour are made and burnt with the corpse, to the 
accompaniment of Tibetan chants. 

After 15 days the lama does a hompujd, -dnd path, reciting Tibetan 
chants of purification. This ends the period of mourning. After a year 
the 'phulaichW is observed, by giving food and clothes to a lama in the 
deceased's name ; and until this is observed the family must not wear any 
new clothes, etc. The shrddh, called dujang in Kanauri, is also solemnised 
by the Idma. The burning-grounds are haunted by Mashan, Rakshas, 
Shyiinjl and Khar-shyund, of whom the first two are conceived of as 
evil spirits or demons, and the two latter as Jack-o'-lanterns or ghostn.^ 

* Fulaich or Fhnlaich, from Hindi phiil, flowtr, is so called because Kanauris d»mnt 
wear now clothea till one year nfter a death in the family, but after performing the dujang 
they may wear flowers and new clothes. 

■\ The sandi and karndl are both musical instruments used in the hills. The former is 
made of >vood and is about a foot long: with seven holes on which the fingers are niaoed 
while playing and its sound ia like that of an algnja ; the latter is made of bi-ass and is 
like a lonw horn with a round, broad tnintb ; in sound it resembl<»8 the conch. 

^ Taking the bones to the Ganges is said to be quite a recent innovation — only dating 
back two or three years 

§ The five >,akshatms are Dhanistha, Shatbhisha, Piirvabhadrapadi, Uttaribhadranadi 
and Rewati. 

II Fhulaiob is also the name of .-i fair held in October eveiy year at Braling, near 
Ropa. See Ukhyang in the list of fairs. 

4 Masli4n and Rakshasa are of course Sanskrit terms. The other two are Kanawari 
possibly corruptions of Tibetan words. It, is worth remarking that Mashan, Shyiina and 
Rakshas are also septs of Kanets, found ia Mellam, Asrang and Rirang villages respectively.

of the Tibetan scriptures are called zomos or jamos. They live in 
nunneries. The two principal nunneries are at Kanam and Sunnam, 
and in these a great number of zomos live. Besides this, every 
village has a few zovios. 

Kanet boys, who learn the Tibetan scriptures, and are well versed 
in the Buddhist doctrines, are called lamas. They live in monasteries 
and are looked upon as very holy. In fact they are the priests of 
all of the Kariets. There are several monasteries of these lamas in 
Kdnam, Sunnam, and other villages. LJmas are either Gyojang or 
celibate, like the Brahmach;iri, or Dugpu, who marry but never 
shave the head. 

The loma is consulted with regard to every important undertaking. 
Thus he is asked to name an auspicious day for beginning to plough 
or sow, and at the time ascertained he recites chants like the one 
beginning: Om akdni nikdiii ambitd mandate mantdle swdhd,' Ma,y 
the gods bestow on us abundance ot grain.* When a new roof is put 
on a temple, which is called shdnt* the lamas perform a ceremony,

the Panjdbi Kan jar. The word Tcanchan is said to mean 'gold' or 
'pure and illustrious.' The Hindu prostitute is coninionly known as 
R^mjani, Harkain being also used.* Randi is also used for a prostitute 
in the east of the Province, hut it only means a * widow ' throughout the 
Punjab proper. Only two-fitths of the Kanchans are males. They form 
a distinct class, though not only their offspring, but also girls bought 
in infancy or joining the community in later life and devoting them- 
selves to prostitution, are known as Kanchans. lu the south-east of the 
Punjab, however, the Kanchans appear to form a fairly distinct caste. 
Those of them who have followed their profession for generations are 
styled deraddrs and look down upon the later reci'uits. 'J'hej have a more 
or less definite custom of inheritance,t and the birth of a girl is the 
occasion for greater rejoicings than that of a boy, as a girl is a source of 
wealth. The unmarried girls arc^ generally prostituted, but wives and 
sons' wives are kept in even more rigid seclusion than high caste women. 
Wives have to be purchased from poor people of any tribe at consider- 
able cost, as Kanchans do not give their daughters in marriage and can- 
not obtain brides in their own caste. When a girl attains pubei-ty and 
co-habits with a man for the first time a feast, called sliadi missi, is 
given to all the brotherhood, and menials get their doles. Prior to this 
ceremony the girl may wear a nose-ring, but not after it. Seven months 
after a pregnancy too the brotherhood is feasted and menials paid their 
dues. The mirdsi of the Kanchans is called dddd and gets a rupee a 
year. A woman of another caste is admitted into the sisterhood by 
drinking a cup of sweetened water and she is then entitled to be treated, 
even in matters of inheritance, like a natural daughter. The Kanchan, 
Rdmjani and Harkain are said to rank above the Barikka,J Malzdda, 
MusALLi and Nat — all of whom appear to be or rank as prostitute castes. 
The Kanchans of Ludhiana found in Ndbha say they were Chushattli 
Mughals descended from one Mirza Jeb. His grandFather Mirza Alara 
was put to dpath for some reason at Delhi and fled to R^mpur. He is 
said to be still spoken of as ' Rdmpur Juni ' and in order to conceal his 
identity he joined the Kanchans. See also Perna.

* The story told is that Ahad's son, the king Shidad, built a magnificent palace, which he 
named Paradise In it he placed virgins instead of the houris of Paradise, who are lawful 
to tha dwellers therein. This recalls the practice of the Assassins as told in the Bistnry 
of that sect by von Hammer, p. 187 of the English translation : — 

" A youth who was deemed worthy, by his strength and resolution, to be initiated into 
the Assassin service, was invited to the table and conversation of the grandmaster or 
grand- prior : he was then intoxicated with henbane {hashhh) and carried into the garden, 
which, on awakening, he believed to bo the Paradise : everything around him the houris in 
particular, contributed to confirm his delusion." 

The Rtimjani of course claims descent from R'un Chandra.

distinguished from the Kandera or Penja of Delhi. They are a river 
tribe, and their original occupation was plaiting mats from gi'ass and 
leaves, making string, and generally working in grass and reeds ; but 
they have now taken to weaving generally, and even cultivate land. 
In Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu, however, they still work in kdthud and 
hander, of which they make mats and patalis for the roofs of houses, as 
well as ropes. They are a low caste, slightly but only slightly superior 
in standing and habits to the other grass-workers and tribes of the river

Kanet. — The Kanets are the yeoman peasantry of the eastern Himalayas in 
tbe Punjab, and of the hills at their base. On the west they extend as 
far as Bangahal and the eastern portion of the K^ngra Valley, occupying 
the whole of Kullu,* Mandi, Suket, the Simla Hill States and Sirmur. 
A few are also found east of the Sntlej in the Jhandbari ildqa of Hoshid-r- 
pur and the Kotaha Valley of Ambdla is also held by them. In Kdngra 
Proper their place is filled by the Ghirths. TIih Rd,jputs are, gc^nerally 
speaking, their over-lords, but in many places, especially in the Simla 
Hills, they have retained their original independence and are directly 
subordinate to the Rd,jput Rd,jd,s. 

The common derivation of Kanet or Kanait is from kunit ' indiffer- 
ence' or 'hostility' to the Shd,shtras, and the Rd,jputs or Ohhatris who 
did not observe them strictly are said to have been called 'Kanait.' 
Their Kxity was mainly with regard to wedding and funeral rites and 
in keeping widows as wives. Others pay that the word is really kania 
het or 'love for daughters' because Kanets did not kill their girl-child- 
ren. The true Rajputs used to kill theirs at birth. Another suggestion 
is that ait signifies sons, just as aik signifies brothers and kinsmen, 
e. g. R^mait means Rdmu's sons and Ramaik his brothers and kin. 
Now Rdja Kans of the Purdns is called K^n in Pah^ri and his sons 
would be called Kanait, but since Kans persecuted Brahmans and was 

The Lahul'is, or peasantry in Lihul, m-^ h'qinnln? to call themselves Kanets as they 
become Hinduized. See under Lahala. The Kaaets of Lahul are said to be called Jad by 
the Kanets of KuUu, but that term appears to be uukuowa bath ia Lihul and in Sp iti.

looked ui^oti as a dait (a devil or rdkshasa), he was killed and left 
no descendants. Others say that Krishna, also called Kan in Pal.dri 
mvaded Bashah.- and advanced to Sliurinatpur (now SaraJian i • so his 
descendants are Kanaifc. But neither suggestion appears tenable! 

Speakintj generally, the furtlier wo penetrate into the Hills the lesa 
pure is the Kanet an;i the lower he stands in Hindu estimation. In the 
SiwcUik hills, in Sirmur, below the Chaur Peak, in lower Suket, Mandi, 
N^hlgarh, BiUspur, etc., the pure Kanets at lease rank higher than those 
in the upper hills of KuUu, Saraj and the other Simla States. The 
latter in turn look down upon the Kanets whose country stretches from 
the Negri khad to Kanaur, and they in turn despise the Jdds of 
Kaimur itself. 

In Kullu Proper, i.e., in the Kullu Valley, the Kanets have three '^roups 
or grades : Kliash, Kdhu and Niru*, the latter appai-ontly confined to 
the Dugi-Lag ivaziri in Kullu. Sir James Lyall, however, only noted 
two divisions the ' Kassiya ' and ' Kiio.' The latter say that a Raj^i of Kullu 
ordered the Kanets to reform their loose practices, and conform altogether 
to Hinduism ; tl.ose who obeyed were calleii Kassiyas and those who 
stuck to their old ways, Kilos, it is a fact tliat at the jn-esent day the 
former are more Hindu in all their observances than the latter and the 
story is otherwise probable, as one can see that the foreign priests round 
the Hdjds were always striving to make the Kullu people more orthodox 
Hindus, greater respecters of Brahmans and less devoted to tlie worship 
of their local divinities. The Kassiyas wear the ya?ieo_, and pretend to 
some superiority which, however, is not admittect by the R^ios. They 
intermarry and eat and drink together out of the same cookino--pots but 
not out of the same dish or plate. The late Mr. A. Anderson noted that 
the Kassiya were iroie common in Kullu proper and the Rdo in Sarai. 
The Kanets of thrf remote JMaldna Valley will be found described under 
Ra Deo. According to Cunningham Hdos are also in possession of the 
lower Piibar, Rupin and Tons valleys in the Simla Hills, but those may 
be the Rdhus of those Hills. They give their name to the petty fief 
of Rawdhin or R a wain. 

In the Simla Hills the groups are Kanet, Khash, Rdhu and Knran (?or 
Kuthcira), the Khash ranking below the Kanet, who take their daughters 
in marriage ; while both rank above the Rdhu, who nre votaries of R^hu 
and the Kuran, devotees of Ketu. These two latter groups keep an 

* In Simla the Niru, Noro, Niuru, Nonu, Neona and (or) Notii septus) «r6 said to bp old 
Kanets and descended from the Kijputa— of a tribn nor, spfcified — who were 7?ia'i(;is or 
inovannas, Brnhmana and Miaiis or sonn of Hajas who took Kanet wives. They often 
intermarry with the Kha^h or Khosh. The Nini and Khosh do nor. intermarry with the 
Riihia and Knran, though the two former eat food cocked by each other, and iiUo with the 
Kahu and Kuran except at times of sutuk and putak. In Kullu and l^ashalir the Hahii nnd 
Kuran cook food on an angethn or stove, while the Niru and Khosli nsc chulafi but this is a 
custom rather than a caste distinction. The Kahn and Kurnn diareurMrd tho'ru e of jillh 
i. e., they can drink from the sume cup. With them demise mourning ends after three 
days and on the 5th thoy kill a yoat. Those Kanaita can cohabit with a Koli-., if they 
keep her in a separate house, and any son by her will be a servant in the family but 
cannot claim inherittmce. But a Di,oi woman cannot be kept, as the Da^'i i.s inferior in 
caste to the Koli. These Kanaits eat the flesh of. the ewe, hheri. They^ can marry tho 
maternal uncle's or father's bister's dau>jlitor. 'I'hey are found in Kullu and Bashahr but 
there are very few to the south of the No^Ti. The Dahu and Kuran hardly differ at all

Bahu the stm-devouring dragon, or, in Kullu Proper, from mahit-, a bee.

eclipse as a fete-day, feasting just as it takes place. On the Shivrdtri 
too they make an ox of flour and worship it : arid then the head of the 
family shoots it in the belly with an arrow or cuts it with a sword, and 
the pieces are distributed to all present, in spite of attempts to rescue 
the image.* 

In Rirmur the Kanets are found throughout the State, but trans-Giri 
only the Khash. The latter have an offshoot called Sharai from shara, 
the Muhammadan Law, because their ancestor when hardpressed 
acknowledg^ed himself the Koli of his Muhammarlan oppressors. The 
Khash will give no daughters to the Sharai. Most of the Kanets in 
Sirmur are returned as Punwar. 

The relative position of the different groups can hardly be stated 
with precision. Thus in Kullu Proper the Khash rank higher than the 
I\ahu, despite the saying : 

Khnshia, Khash Ms, 

Man eJc, hah his. 

" To every Khashia,t twenty Khash, 

One mother, twenty fathers." 

In Sar^j the Kanets are polyandi'ous, yet they profess to look down on 
the Kanets of Kullu Proper : and in the Simla Hills the Khash are in- 
ferior to the true Kanets. 

In the Kanaur tract of Bashahr, the Kanets are called Jads or Zads 
and form a distinct sub-caste with which the Kanets of the lower ranges 
do not, as a rule, intermarry or eat, though they will smoke and drink 
with them. They are not at ali particular about their food or drink, 
and will actually eat yak-heet These Kanets will be found fully 
described under Kanauri. 

Throughout Sirmur and the Simla Hills there were until quite recent 
times two great factions, the Shd^tis or followers of the Pandavas, and 
the Bfchis who were adherents of the Kauravas.| Social intercourse 
of any kind between these two groups was absolutely forbidden, but 
they now intermarry, and so on. In Sirmur the adherents of the 
Kauravas are also called Sathnrs, those of the Pandavas Pasars. The 
origin of thefe terms is lost in obscurity. 

The Kanets are, or claim to be, of impure Kd.jput descent, but the 
race is of diverse origin. In Kullu they are often classed by other 
Hindus as on a par with the Rathis§ of Kd,ngra, and just as the latter 



* In the Simla hills, four classes among the Kanets were said to rank higher than the rest 
and are known as the Char Khundh. Their names are Bhaunthi, Parhiar, Chhippar, Balhi'r. 
Other sub-divisions in those hills are :—Kohal, Gahru, Baruri, Chakar, Katlehru, Suraji, 
Khash, Badni, Charola, Badalwal, Jalanu, Rohal, Katalik, Pirwal, Janwal, Dolal, Rohana, 
Kulharn^n, NoTia, Lac^dogarh. But a large number of i-?ieZs are now given as superior to 
the rest of the Kimets. 

t Said to mean "female" (PKhaa). The word Khasha in Sanskrit ia aaid to have 
meant the country inhabited by the fourth class of the Hindus (? Sudras). Ic extended 
from Kumann to the Simla Hills. 

t The Bashis kept the Shivratri on the 14th, the Shatis on the 15th of Pbagan. 

S The Kanets rank well above the Ghirths in the hypergamy scale, for whereas a 
Ghirthni becomes a queen in the 7th generation a Kanetni may aspire to that honour in 
the 5tb which places the Kanets just below the Kathis. 



Kanet septs. 459 

claim to be Rd,jputs, who have lost status by taking to the plough, or 
the offspring of Rd^jputs by women of Sudra rank, so the Kanots say 
that they are the children of women of the hills by Riijputs who came 
up from the plains. On the other hand, another story makes the mass of 
the Kullu population homogeneous and assigns both the Kanets and the 
Dagis to one stock. Two sons of the demi-gnd, Bhim Sain, Pandava, 
each had a son hy a daughter of a Kullu rdkshasa or demon. One of 
these married a Bhotantior Tibetan woman, who fed him on ydk's flesh, 
80 that he and his children by her became Dagis. The other son was 
the ancestor of the Kanets. 

But if the mass uf the Kanets claims descent from various Rajput 
tribes, some, such as the Chibhar, from Kishtwdr and Lahore, and the 
Dogra, from Jammu, claim to be Brahmans by origin. Besides thci" 
nebulous stat.us groups the Kanets are divided into countless septs of 
which only a few can be noticed here. More than 1,10U Kanet khels* 
or septs are enumerated. The khel is quite distinct from the gotra 
which is often, if not always, retained. The origin of some of the khels 
is quite recent and well authenticated. Thus the Sain sept is descended 
from Rdnas of Kot Khdi, Khaneti, Kumharsain and Delhat : the Malid,ra 
sprang from a cadet branch of the ruling families of Bilaspur and 
Ndlagarh; and both, originally R^ijputs by birth, have sunk to Kanet 
status. 

In Sirmur the Jaitki khel is so named from the village of Jaitak, 
but it is said to be descended from a Khatri of Sdmana who espoused 
a Kanetni. 

From the Agnikula Riijputs have sprung the Agnibansi and Punwdr 
septs; and from the Punwd,r the Bhaunthi, Badhdr, Baler, Khanogu 
and Ramal septs. 

The Tanwar or Tantar Kanets arc descended from Rajputs of that 
clan and are found, chiefly, in Bdghal, Mahlog and Kunhidr. 

From the Chauhdns are descended the Rahdni, Namol», Biphrdla. 
Padhar, Padhan, Sadi, Ohauh^n, Ch^ndal and Chandel septs, all 
claiming Baldeo of Delhi as their progenitor. The Badhoi Kanets, 
who are very numerous in the Simla Hills, are also said to bo Chauhan ; 
they are divided into a number of sub-septs and can marry within their 
own sept. Other septs are : — 

]. Bh^radwajet : this gotra name is still in use, but it includes the 
Batdl and Manlu (Kanet) septs and the Chanarii (Brahmans). Tradi- 
tion says that once a Brahman maiui of Sonwal, a village in Koti, 
had two sons who married Kanet brides. One settled at Mclnla village, 
the other at Bhdtld, and they founded the Mdnlu and Batdl «e])ts. 
Those of the family .vho remained Brahmans settled at Chan^ri, a 
village in Koti and are called Chhndrii. 2. Kalal : a sept which takes 
its name from Kelo, a village in Koti, and gives its na/ne to the Kalalthi 
pargana of that State. H. Chauhan, a sept which occupies the upper 
valley of the P^bar in Jubbal, and is numerous in Keon^hal, Sirmur, 



♦The word hhcl is pronounced like kher, with the hartH, in the Simla Hills. It may,

gotra name, more than half of whom are returned fiom Bashahr, where 
the Kanets are divided into numerous septs. 

The Rancts of Kullu, 
Kanets of both sexes wear a dress which is picturesque, and not at all 
oriental. A red and black woollen cap, not unlike a Scotcli bonnet at 
first sight, a grey or brown loose woollen tunic girt in, with a rope or 
sash at the waist, a striped or chequered blanket worn like a Scotch 
plaid round the chest and over the shoulders, form the di-ess of the men. 
If well enough off, they add loose woollen trousers tight round the ankle. 
Some of the women wear a cap like that of the men, under which their 
hair hangs down in long plaits lengthened out with plaits of worsted, 
but most of them do without a cap, and wear their hair puffed out and 
twisted into a high sloping chignon, not unlike the fashion once prevail- 
ing among English women. Instead of a tunic they wear a plaid or 
blanket fastened around them with bodkins, and so skilfully put 
on that while the neck and arms are bare, all the rest of the body is 
modestly covered to below the knee : the leg is bare or covered with a 
woollen gaiter : broad metal anklets are not uncommon, and set off the 
leg very prettily ; the arms are generally overloaded with bracelets. 
Both sexes are generally shod with sandals made of plaited straw or 
hemp, but many go bare foot, and a few wear leather shoes. Both sexes, 
especially on festival days, are fond of wearing bunches of flowers stuck 
in their caps or in their hair, and strings of flowers hung round their 
necks. Some are hardly darker than Spaniards in complexion, with a 
ruddy color showing in their cheeks ; otliers are as dark as the ordinary 
Punjabi.^ They are not tall, but look strong and active, and generally 
have handsome figures. Many of the wor.ien have fine eyes, and a mild 
and gentle expression of face, but the men, on the whole^ have the 
advantage in regularity of feature. The finest men are to be found in 
Sardj. The women do most of the field work, with the exception of 
ploughing, but in return they have more liberty than m most parts of 
India. They attend all the fairs and festivals [jach) held periodically at 
every temple in the country. At the^e fairs both sexes join in the 
fdno-ino- and dancing, but the women in Kullu dance separately, and at 
nio'lit only. In Bashahr the Kanets ot both sexes dance together. In 
the L'Ag and Parol icazirls it is not uncommon to see many of both sexes 
returning from the fairs decidedly tipsy, the result of deep potations 
of iiiir or lugri, a kind of weak acid beer, generally brewed at home, from 
rioe. In Riapi and Saiaj drinking is considered a reproach, and almost 
universally escliewed.t In the winter, when confined to their houses by 



* With the exception of a few families, descendants of the Rajas' priests or parohit)>, the 
Kullu Brahmans differ very little in appearance, dress or customs from the Kanets. The 
same may be s^id of nearly all of tbe few Rajputs. The blood is in fact genernlly very 
mixed, for both Brahmans and Hajputs commonly marry Kanet girls: such wives are 
known as arit in distinction from tho Idri, or wife of tbe same CHSte taken b_v the regular 
hidh ceremony: Lyall's Kangra Se'f. i''ep.,§ 114-. The text, is from § 112. 

tin Rupi a mildly intoxicating, but very refreshing, infusion of hemp-leaves (bhany), 
violets and sugar is occasionally indulged in at fairs. In the other ivaziris of Kullu Proper, 
towards Uie sources of the Beas, there is much drunkenness. The hill-beer is of two kinds, 
Uogrl and chakti and sur. The former is made from rice, fermented with jyhap, a kind of 
veast which is imported from Ladakh or Baltislan, and the composition of which is a trade

cloth for sale oi' home consumption : the women do not weave in 
Kullu. 

Social usages. 

'The s cial usages of the Kauets are not peculiar to the caste, but are 
those which are followed by the other castes in the localities con- 
cerned, the upper classes of the Kanets observing the same usagf^s as 
the Brahmans or Rdjputs, while the lower are content to follow much 
the fame customs as the artisan castes below them. A full account 
therefore of all the Kanet social usages and religious beliefs wonld be 
tantamount to a description of all the Hindu usages in vogue in the 
hills of Kullu. Mandi, Suket and Simla, together with an account of all 
the Hindu beliefs in those hills. Suuh an account is attempted in the 
Introductory Volume; and the notes which follow give only the barest 
outlines of the social observances in Kullu. Those of the Kanets of 
Ldhul, Kanaur and Bashahr and separately described under Lahula 
and Kanadki, and below on p. 000 will be found an account of the 
people of Bashahr. 

On the birth of a male child in Kullu there is a feast, and a present 
is made to the headman [negi] of the Kothi. The child is christened 
some time within the year following, and is then produced in public, 
and there is another fea^t. It is a common custom in Outer Sar^] to 
give two brothers names that rhyme. According to one informant, 
who ranks all Kanets as Sudras, the Khash observe the same rites at 
birth as the twice-born castes, while the Raos, like the low castes, simply 
offer a bunch of green grass to the child's father and he places it on 
his head, but gives no alms. 

' Three kinds of marriage ceremonies are in use in Knllu, viz. (1) Bedi 
hiahjthe ordinary Hindu form ; (2) rttti nmnai, four or five men go from 
the bridegroom to the bride's house, dress her up, put a cap on her head, 
and then bring her home to thn bridegioom ; (3) Ganesh puja, tlie form 
used by Brahmans, Khatris, Suniasas, etc., in marrying a Kanet girl. The 
bridegroom sends his priest and others to the bride's house wliere worship 
of Ganesh is performed, and the bride then brought home. Suniaras 
send a knife to represent them. The children of a Brahman and Rajput 
by a Kanet wife are called Brahmans and Rdjputs ; the term Kathi is 
of ten added as a qualification by any one pretending himself to unmixed 
blood. In the absence of other children they are their father's full heirs, 
but in the preseiice of other children by a Idri wife tliey would ordinarily 
only get an allotment by way of maintenance, put by seme at one-fifth, 
but the limit seems rather vague m pi'actice. The rule of inheritance in 



secret of the brewers, who are nearly all Ladakhis or LihuUs, and thus able to keep 
the roadside public-houses and the drinking- tents at fairs in their own hands. Four 
measures of rice are mixed with 4 equal measures of fihap, and to the mixture is added the 
same bulk of water, the whole suflicing to fill a large earthenware vessel in which it is 
allowed to remain for i dnys : the liquor is then strained off, and will keep good for 8 days ; 
it is aoid and sickening, and an acquired taste is necessary for its appreciation. Sur is the 
" table beer " of the country, brewed by the people in their homes, and is made in the same 
way as c/iflA/i'. but with fcorf)7J millet instead of rice, and a ferment called dhili. instead of 
phap. jD/i!7i is a mixture of .-71/ !< and various herbs kneaded into a cake without any ad- 
mixture of water, and kept warm below a layer of barley straw for 20 days or so, when it 
begins to smell, it is then dried, and is ready for use. 



462 The Kullu Kanets. 

KuUu among all tribes at the pi-esent day is pagvand, or^ as it is here 
called, mundevand, that is, all leojitimate sons of one father get an equal 
share without reference to the number of sons born of each wife or 
mother. Among the Kanets and the lower castes the real custom hitherto 
has been that every son by a woman kept and treated as a wife was 
legitimate. It was not necessary that any ceremony should have been 
performed. If no one else claimed the woman, and she lived with the 
man as a wife, the son born from such cohabitation was legitimate. In 
the same way among the same classes a pichlag, or posthumous son 
(called ronda in Knllu), born to a widow in the house of a second husband, 
is considered the sou of the second husband ; and a widow cannot be 
deprived of her life tenure of her husband's estate for want of chastity 
so long as she does not go away to live in another man's house. It 
appears to be a general idea in Kullu that a father could, by formal deed 
of gift executed in his lifetime, give his estate to a daughter, in default 
of sons, without consent ol: next of kin. It is, I think, doubtful also 
whether a distant kinsman (say, more than tl-.ree or four generations 
apart) could claim against a daughter without gift, and, it seems, 
generally allowed that a gharjatcdi or son-in-law taken into the house 
becomes after a time entitled to succeed as a kind of adopted son 
without proof of gift' : (Lyall, § Ho). 

• Polyandry now prevails only in Saraj, and there the custom seems to 
be tending to fall into disuse. It is in reality a mere custom of com- 
munity of wives among brothers who have a community of other goods. 
In one house you may find three brothers with one wife, in the next three 
brothers with four wives, all alike in common ; in the next house there 
may be an only son with three wives to himself. It is a matter of means 
and of land ; a large farm requires several women to look after it. 
Where there is only one wife to several brothers, it will generally be 
found that some of the brothers are absent for part of the year working 
as laborers. In former years I have seen perplexing claims arise from 
this custom. The sons or grandsons of a family which has lived in 
polyandry agree to divide the ancestral estate, and quarrel as to the 
shares, some saying that each son should get an equal share, others that 
the sons of each mother (where the fathers had several wives in common) 
should get an equal share, others that the sons of each putative father 
should get an equal share. Of late years such disputes have seldom 
arisen, as it has become a pretty generally recognised principle that, as 
far as our courts are concerned, the woman in these cases is the wife 
only of the eldest son or head of the family, and all sons she may bear 
must be presumed to be his. This principle agrees in results with, what 
I believe to have been in former times, the general rule of inheritance, 
as between the children of brothers all living in community of wives 
(but it must be confessed that no one custom seems to have been rigidly 
followed in all cases) ; on the other hand, as between the children of 
brothers all of whom did not live in community of wives, the old custom 
of the country was, I believe, as follows : — If of three brothers, one 
separated off his share of the estate and set up for himself, and the other 
two lived on in common and a son was born in their house ; then such 
son was considered to be the child of two fathers and heir to the estate 
of both : the separated brother or his children could claim no share of 
such estate on the death of either of the united brothers. This appears 



The Kullu Kanets. 453 

to me to have been tlie custom in past times, but it is opposed to the 
principle, above mentioned as at present in force, of only recognisiiio- the 
mother to be the wife of one of the brothers, and I am not aware tlmt it 
has been ever affirmed by our courts.'* Lyall, § 117. 

A corpse is burnt ordinarily on the day following the death, before 
the cremation it is covered witli a clotli, and the musicians play. If 
the deceased is of goo^ family his ashes are at once taken to Hardwdr 
whateverthe season of the year: otherwise they are kept till the 
winter, when a party is made up to convey to the Gang* s the ashes of 
all who have died in the neighbourhond during the summer. The for- 
mal funeral ceremonies (the gati) are performed on the tenth day 
after death, when the deceased's clothes are divided among the 
officiating Brahmans and the Kumh^rs who provide the earthen pots 
for the funeral. On the 13th day (pacJii) a goat is sacrificed and 
is eaten at a feast by the relatives of the family. Kanets of the lower 
class (the Raos) perform all these ceremonies on one day, the third after 
the death. In some places it is usual after a cremation to make a small 
foot-bridge over running water somewhere in the neighbourhood to 
help the passing of the soul of the deceased. On the fourth anniver- 
sary of the death the chauharkha feast is celebrated, and until then 
the widow, if faithful to the memory of the duad, should remain in 
mourning and refrain from wearing her orDameots, she is forbidden for 
ever to wear again her gold nose-ring and huldk. 

*The Kullu people are good humoured among themselves but rough 
and inhospitable to strangers, very shy and distrustful of any new officer 
but almost fond of one they know well, very submissive to constituted 
authority if exercised with any tact, not given to theft, and not much to 
falsehood ; but this is partly the result of a simplicity or want of cunning 
which does not see how a fact perfectly well known to the questioned 
person can be concealed from the questioners. On the otlier hand, they 
are not so industrious, so frugal, or so enterprising" as the Kdno-ra people 
and they are still more superstitious. That they have imagination is 
proved by many of their legends and fairy tales which contain as much 
of that quality as any in the world. Their sense of the picturesque is 
proved by the situation they chose for their temples, by the wild stories 
they attach to each cave, lake, frowning cliff, rugged rock, or waterfall 
to explain the impression which its form produces on their minds. They 
are very fond of music ; the tunes, which are quick and lively, remind 
one of Irish jigs or Scotch reels. The women sing a great deal and 
rhyming songs are made at each marriage or funeral, or in commemo- 
ration of any remarkable event. As a general rule, one line in each 
couplet is not original and has no reference to the subject in hand. It 
belongs, in fact, to a collection of old lines, which is used as a common 
stock by all the poets of the country, like a Gradits ad Paruassum 
This is a splendid invention for reducing the difficulty of rhvmino- 
which keeps so many poets mute in other countries. Their heads are 
full of strange fancies about things spiritual ; for instance, they believe 

* Amonn the Kanets of Kodh Sowar, t. e., m Bangahal the vands or separate holdin;-,s 
were indivisible, so that if the owner of a single land died it went to his kanna or youngest 
son, while if he held two, the other went to his next youngest, and so on. The elder sons 
went out into the world and took service with the R4j4 or elsewhere, earning a grant of 
land thereby, while the younger sons remained at home and succeeded. 



464 The Bashahr people. 

in the soui leaving the body during sleep, and account in this way for 
dreams : in these wanderings they say the sonl can hold converse with 
the spirits of deceased persons, and communications are often received 
in this way. Both men and women are very susceptible of the passion 
of love, and do wild things under its influence. 'I'hey will run off and 
live together in a cave in the mountains till forced down by the pangs of 
starvation. Men of the best families constantly incur imprisonment or 
loss of office for breaclies of marriage laws, or social outlawry for the 
SHke of some low caste woman. They are not manly or martial in 
manner, but I doubt if they can be called a cowardly race. 1 have seen 
them attack bears and leopards without firearms in a rather courageous 
way.'"^ Apart from the jollifications at the fairs, the people, eveo the 
children, have few amusements. A game called chagols or "sheep and 
panthers " is sometimes played with pebbles for pieces on a rough sort 
of chessboard chalked on a rock. 

To describe the religious ideas of the Kanets would be tantamount to 
o-iving an account of modern Hinduism in the Himalayas. But to show 
the curious natures of their superstitions it is worth while tc- describe an 
expiatory ceremony, which is occasionally performed with the object of 
removing grah or bad luck or evil influence which is supposed to be brood- 
ing over a hamlet. The cZeoia of the place is, as usual, first consulted 
through the chela and declares himself also under the spell, and advises 
a jag or feast, which is given in the evening at the temple. Next mornirg 
a man goes round from house to house with a kilta or creel on his back, 
into which each family throws ail sorts of odds and ends, pairing 
of nails, pinches of salt, bits of old iron, handfuls of grain, etc. ; 
the whole community then turns out and circumambulates the villnge, 
at the same time stretching an unbroken thread round it fastened to 
pegs at the four corners. This done, the man with the creel carries it 
down to the river-bank, and empties the contents therein, and a sheep, 
fowl, and some small animals arc sacrificed on the spot. Half the sheep 
is tbe perquisite of the man who dares to carry the creel, and he is also 
entertained from house to house on the following night. 

The people op Bashahr State. 
The Bashahris or people of Bashahr, the Simla Hill State which lies 
most remote from the Punjab proper, differ in their customs so materi- 
ally from the peoples of the other Simla Hill States that it is necessary 
to describe them separately. While the mass of the population is 
Kanet, Rajputs or Th^kurs, Brahmans and the low castes of the Simla 
Hills are also well represented in Bashahr, but the customs of tlie 
people as a whole are those of the Kanets, the dividing line between the 
different castes being very indistinct. Tne following account of the 
people of Bashahr is from the pen of Pandit Tika Ram -Joshi. It excludes 
the customs of Kanaur, for which reference must be made to Kanauei. 
The Kanets of Bashahr appear to be divided into two hypergamous 
sub-castes (groups) : — 
(i) Khash. 

(n) Kar^n, or Rahu, from whom the Khash take daughters but do 
not give them brides in return. 



*Lyall's Kangra Sett. Rep,, § 1)8. The rest of the above account is from that work or 
the Kullu Gazetteers. 



Customs in Bashahr. 465 

There is also a third, a sectarian gi'oup, the Ganesha, so called be- 
cause they adore the deity Ganesb. 

The Kanets were originally Thdkurs, but lost status by adopting 
widow remarriage. 

The Brahmans of Bashahr are divided into three grades : — 
[i) Uttam, who do not plough. 

{ii) Ach^raj, who receive the ashuhh dan or impure alms of the 
other Brahmans and Rajputs, They take daughters in 
marriage from the 

(iii) Krishna, who plough. 

Like the other two twice-born castes most of the Brahmans in Bashahr 
are sirtords and not of pure descent. Those that are of pure blood may 
be divided into two grades :— 

(a) The State purohits, who intermarry, and eat kachhi with the 

purohits of R^nwi, a village of Brahmans who are priests 
to the Raja, and Brahmans as well as with those of Dwarch 
and Singrd;. 

(b) Bdz^r purohits. 

All the twice-born castes will eat pdkki with one another, and even 
from the Khash and Kar^n Kanets ; but they never do so with the 
Krishna group of' the Brahmans. 

Observances at : 

1. Birth. — During pregnancy the huldeotd is worshipped, if neces- 
sary, and between the seventh and eighth months the Aahtam Riihu is 
also worshipped,* but these observances are confined to the twice-born 
castes and to the better class of the Khash Kanets. Brahmans predict 
the child's sex by counting a handful of almonds, odd numbers indicat- 
ing a boy, even a girl. The birth of a girl passes unnoticed, but that 
of a boy is the occasion for festivities and almsgiving. As a rule the 
midwife is a woman of low caste, but sometimes Kardn women are so 
employed. During the last five months of pregnancy the midwife 
massages the woman at the end of each month to keep the foetus in 
position. 

The gontrdld is observed by Brahmans, Rajputs and Vaisyas after 
11, 13 and 15 days, respectively. Some of the Khash also observe it. 
On the expiry of this period the family is deemed clean again, and 
other families of the tribe can eat with them. The mother is also puri- 
fied after the gontrdld. The impurity only lasts three days among the 
menial tribes. 

The ceremony of feeding the child for the first time is called lugru, 
and is observed at an auspicious moment, with worship of Ganpati and 
the nine planets, and various festivities. 

The child is named at the annodak,\ and as usual given two names. 
This is done when it is five or six months old as a rule. Natica is ob- 

* Simply by making gilts to priests and other Brahmans. 

t At which the child is fed for the first time on grain and water. (From Sanskr. anna 
grain, and udak, water). 



Marriage in Bashahr. 

served among the three higher castes, and since recent times by some 
of the Khash. 

Women whose children die prematurely have recourse to various 
charms, but the favourite remedy is the worship of the Ashtam R^hu, 
especially in cases of ashtamrdh* or falling sickness, to which children 
are liable. 

The first tonsure (locally called kanhdl)^ is done at the huldeotd's 
temple alone. It is observed by the twice-born castes on^ a day fixed 
by a purohit or 'pddha : and by other castes with the deotd's permission. 

2. Marriage. — Ritual marriage is confined to the ruling family and 
to some Darbaris, Brahmans and B^nias of Rampur town. Amongst 
them a betrothal once made is irrevocable, except on account of leprosy, 
constant ill-health or apostasy on the bridegroom's part, or in the event 
of his committing a crime. 

As soon as the date of the wedding is fixed, the preparations for it 
are begun on an auspicious day. The commencement of the wedding 
is called the sarhdramhh.X A kangnd is tied round the bridegroom's 
wrist and after that he must not go outside the house. Ganpati is 
then worshipped, and haind is rubbed on the bodies of both bride and 
bridegroom for three to five days, according to the means of the family. 
Worship of the Kidjd, i.e., the boy's family god, is then performed. 
When the marriage party sets out, the bridegroom is garlanded,§ but 
those of his family who are under ihe influence of gharastak (Sanskr. 
qrihastak, ' family ') must not see the garland or it will bring them bad 
luck. The cost of the garland as well as the expenses of the graha 
shdntiW are borne by the bridegroom's maternal uncle. 

After the departure of the wedding party the women observe the 
parohd or parowdn,^ but this is not known in the villages. This cus- 
tom general throughout the Hills, is confined to the women because 
all the men have gone on the wedding procession. The women per- 
form the wedding rites at the bridegroom's house, one representing the 
priest, others the bride and bridegroom, and so on, with songs and 
dances. 

When the bridegroom reaches the bride's house the parents meet 

gj,g^ ail observance called milni — and the bridegroom must not see his 

narents- or sister-in-law until the lagan pherd rite has been solemnised. 



* If Ashtamrnh or asht mrdhu, that is, the planet Bahu (the eighth grdh) is at the eighth 
Dlace from the lagnd in which the boy was born, brings sickness to him ; and to avert this 
Ra.hu must be worshipped. Since the eighth place from the javmu-lagnd (birth lagnd) is 
that of Death, there is danger of sickness if it is occupied by Rahu, Shani and Mangal 

^' t Kanhdl, from Sanskrit, karnavedlid, meaning boring of ears, is the ceremony in which 
the ears are' pierced for the insertion of earrings. The Kuladevata and Ganpati are wor- 

TFrora Sanskrit mrh, all, and dmmhh, commencement. 

ti.c,a ^hehrd is placed on the bridegroom's head. Children by a former wife are forbid- 
den to see their father put on the shchrd on the occasion of his second marriage ; throughout 
tho H ills, children by a former wife are not allowed to see their father in the guise of a 

bridegroom. -•-..• i . 

II Graha shdnh or worship of the nine planets, 
fl £'axohd or parowdn appears to be derived from paurdnd, to send to sleep.

oilingof the bride. After worshipping Arabika and performing ;a/;"'i<rat 
the bridegroom's si/im is untied by his besr, man, who mist bn a re- 
lative. The weddijig concludes with the untying of the bride's kangnd 
by a man who is regarded as a great friend of the bridegroom. 

The bride returns to her father's lionae three weeks or a month after 
the wedding. This is called the dwirdgaman, and sometimes costs 
one-fourth of the amount spent on the actual wedding. 

Bower. 
Only among the twice-born castes does a bride receive dower, stri' 
dhan. This includes the presents made to her by her father and hus- 
band, and the gifts made to her by her mother-in-law and others at the 
end of the wedding ceremony. 

The Bashahr State has recently bestowed two villages on the two 
Deis of Bashahr who were married to the Riija of Kdshipiir. The in- 
come of these two villag-es will go to the two Deis at Kiighipur, and to 
their offspring after their death. J Occasionally the chief or a rani 
gives dower to a Brahmiiji girl. She is then called a kanhori, and is 
regarded as the donor's own daughter. Even poor men give a dauo-hter 
some dower according to their means. Locally this is called sambhdl, 
a term which includes any present made to a married daughter on 
certain occasions.

t This " pilgrimage to a spring " i>^ made on the fourth day after the wedding, 
t " It seems quite opposed to all custom," wrote Sir James Lyall, " for a Hindu Raj4 to 
give territory as dower with a daughter." Kangra Sett. Rep., § 129. No doubt the custom is 
unusual but undei' certain circumstances it clearly exists. 



468 Marriage in Bashahr, 

Formal marriage is not, however, universally observed even by 
Brahmans or Rajputs, on the one hand : while, on the other, even Bfinids 
in townships observe the rites in vogue among Brahmans of the higher 
classes. Brahmans in the villages only observe the lagan phera. 
Among the Rd.jputs the Thdkurs who live in villages and marry in 
their own class omit the lagan phera, as do the agricultural Khash, 
but Thdkurs who aspire to iSdidn status, and the upper classes among 
the Khash, do observe it. In brief formal marriage is confined to 
families resident in a bazar or township or connected with the Bashahr 
darbdr. 

Customary marriage. 

Customary marriage is usually observed by the Th^kurs and Khash 
who perform no lagan vedi rites, but simply worship the dwdr-mdtri*, 
the hearth, and the nine planets. Collectively these observances are 
called shanh-bhari.f These are the binding ingredients in the rite, al- 
though if a girl is being married to several husbands, the attendance 
of one only is indispensable. 

Another form of customary marriage with a maid, who is wooed and 
won from a fair or a place of pilgrimage, is prevalent among the Khash 
and Kar^n. It is solemnised by worship of the door and hearth, and 
by the andarera or andrela,t and the pair are regarded as bride and 
bridegroom. 

If the girl's parents have a husband in view, but she is forcibly 
carried off from a fair or elsewhere by another man, they will never- 
theless go to her wedding and give her a dower in money, clothes, etc., 
while the bridegroom gives his mother-in-law, father, or brother- 
in-law a present in cash.§ 

The consideration paid by the bridegroom to the bride's guardians is 
called dherii and if from any cause the marriage is dissolved this sum 
must be refunded to the bridegroom. The man who abducts or seduces 
a married woman is liable for the payment of the dheri to her first hus- 
band. Moreover, if she has a child by her first husband and takes it 
with her, the second husband becomes liable for this child's mainte- 
nance ; but it does not inherit its step-father's property. 

An unmarried woman who gives birth to a child is called bahhi or 
hahri, and the child, who is called jatii or jhdtu, has no right whatever, 
if she marry, in her husband's property. 



* The divdr-7ndtri are seven nj'mphs, who reside in the doors ; their names are as fol- 
lows : Kalyani, Dhanada, Nanda, Punnya, Funyamukhi, Jaya or Vijayi, The whole group 
is called Dwar-matri. 

] From Sanskrit shdkhochchdra, the recitation of the bride's and bridegroom's got. skdkhd 
(whence the name), and parvara. Hence this rite corresponds to the gotrachdr of the plains. 
Brahmans are paid for this recitation. Twice-born castes observe the skdkhochchdr, while 
the fourth class, that is the Kanets, call the wedding ceremony the shaiikh-lhari. 

X Said to be the Sanskrit vadhu-pravesh, the observance by which a lawfully married wife 
enters her husband's house at an auspicious time, with music and singing. 

§ Customary marriage is not permissible among the twice-born castes, and if such a 
marriage occur, the issue are only entitled to maintenance, or to a field or shop (for main- 
tenance) vvithout power of alienation : but such issue may succeed in default of fully 
legitimate issue or agnates. 



Death'tites in Bashahr. 469 

Observances at Death. 
The alms given at death are called khat-ras* deva dan, gdu dan, 
haitarni dan, &nd panch ratn, and are offered by all castes. 

A mdli or nachhatri, called the ashdnti, can predict the fates of those 
who accompany the bier. The mdli is a worshipper of ghosts {mashdn 
and bhut). He is not a Brahman, but a Kanet, or even a man of low 
caste ; and he predicts after consulting his book of divination [giij.ne hi 
hitdb). 

In the villages of Bashahr are men who can foretell deaths. Such a 
man is called a mushdni. They differ from the mdli. 

Chelds (lit. disciples) in Bashahr are called rndlis of the deotdf and 
in order to ascertain if a man, woman or child is under a demon's in- 
fluence, the demon's mdli is called in. Taking some rapeseed in his 
hand he predicts the period within which the patient will recover. It 
the latter regains his health, a bali is offered to the demon. 

Bahrd sundhdX is performed after 13 days among Brahmans, and 
15 among Rajputs, while Kanets perform it after 15 or even after 10 
days. If the proper day chances to be inauspicious the observance is 
held a day earlier or later. The Brahman bhojan, or feast given to 
Brahmans, is called dharmshdnti, and after it the twice-born castes 
are considered purified. 

The mdshi is a shrddh held one lunar month after the death. The 
chhe-vAdshi is held six months after it. 

The larashwd is held on tlie first anniversary, and on it alms, includ- 
ing a shayyd^, a palanquin, horse, etc., are given to the family Achdraj 
or, in villages, to the Krishna Brahmans. A similar shrddh is held on 
the second and third anniversaries. On the fourth is held the chau- 
barkhi. The soul goes through three phases, prdiii, pret and rishet,\\ 
and on the completion of the fourth year it is purified and becomes a 
pilar deotd. In addition the pdrband^ and kdnidgat shrddhs are ob- 
served for four or five generations. 

The deceased is also worshipped among the twice-born castes as a 
godling, sati, pdp or newa ; and among others an image is made of 
stone or of silver, for which some grain is set apart at each harvest, and 



* Khat-ras dan generally called dashaddn, the gift of ten things, viz., a cow, (2) land, (3) 
sesamum, (4,) gold, (5) clarilied butter (ghi), (6) a cloth, (7) unpounded rice, (8) sugar, 
(9) silver, (.10) salt. Ant ddn is a gift made, given by the son on his father's breathing 
his last, Dev-dan is to oHer some gift to the deities. Those who receive the death- bed gifts 
from Brahmans and Rajputs are called Ach^raj or Maha- Brahmans, and those who receive 
the death- bed gifts from other castes are termed Krishan Brahmans. 

t The mdlis are exorcists as well, and also give oracles, 

X Bakrd means a goat, sacriliced 15 days after a death, and sundhd means assafoetida 
which is never eaten imtil the ceremony called bakrd {and) sundhd has been performed. 

§ Shnytjd means bedding. In the shayya-ddn the following articles are given ; a cot 

bedding, quilt, bed-sheet, cooking vessels, dish, male and female attire, and ornaments 

all according to one's means. 

II For one year after death the soul is called pret, and from the second year to the fourth it 
is called nshet, from rishi, a sage. 

^ The pdrvan shrddh is that which is performed on a parbi, such as an eclipse, on the 
8th and 14th of the dark half of a month, at an amdicas or a puranmdsi. And the kshaydh 
or ekodist shrddh is that which is observed annually on the date of the death. 



4* ^ Temples in Bashahr, 

sometimes a he-goat is sacrificed and liquor drunk, the belief being that 
omission to keep up the worship of the dead will end in disaster. 

Brahmans and Rajputs observe the samndana, sa-pindi shrddh and 
harchhii. In the latter rite khir (rice, milk and sugar) is prepared, and 
a Mahabrahraan is fed with it. Then the corpse is put in a shroud and 
carried out to the burning ground. On the road pinds are given to 
ensure immunity to the deceased, and an earthen vessel is also broken. 
A lamp is kept burning till the Mrid, to light the soul on its dark road, 
and the dharm-ghaia placed beside it to quench its thirst.* 

Cults in Bashahr. 

The temples in Bashahr are of undoubted antiquity, and those of 
Nirt, Nagar and the Four Theris (see p. 471) are said to date back to 
the Tretd,-yug ; those at Khar^han and Sungra in Bhaba pargand and 
at Chue:don in Kanaur to the Dw^par-yug. Most of them were 
originally constructed in those periods. 

The temple servants are the kdrddr or manager, pujdri, hhanddri, 
tokru, math, kdyath, mdlif and hajantri. 

In the villages the term pujdri or dectvX is applied to those who 
carry the deotd's car or rath, as well as to those who accompany the 
deotd to their villages. 

At Shungra, Chug^on and Gramang in Kanaur are temples of the 
three Maheshras. Grdmang is a village in Bhdbd pargand also called 
Kath-gaon. 

The bajantri are drummers or musicians and get grain, a he-goat 
(and sometimes a shroud at a death) for their services. Others ofier a 
cloth, called s/idn'§, to the temple for the decoration of the god's rath. 

The pujdris ordinarily belong to the first class of Kanets. The 
hhanddri is the storekeeper. The tokru's duty is to weigh, and the 
function of the mdth or mdlhas is to ask oracles of the deity on behalf 
of the people. 

The gods of the village-temples are subordinate to the god of a Deo 
mandir or '' great temple," and they perform certain services for him, 
e. g., &t a y ag\\ and atisiirs^ in retuvn for the fiefs [jdgiif^) granted 
them by him. 

Similarly the temples at Sungr^^ and Khard.h&n contain subordinate 
deotdn, and a Deo mandir usually possesses one or more hirs*"^ to whom 
food and sacrifice are offered, and who are also worshipped. 

Further in the temple of a village-god will generally be found two 
cars, one for the presiding god, the otiier for his subordinate, or kotxcdl. 

* A person of the same name and r&shi as the deceased must not accompany the bier, 
and should perform a graha-ddn for his own protection. 

t Here mail means the man called dlmvan in these hills, and groTcch in Kanaur. 

j Deotus are those who worship the deity ; they are also called 'pujdns. Deotus are 
especially those who carry tlie rath of the deity, and cause him to dance. 

§ Shdri a dhoti-cloih. or piece of cloth attaclied to the car of the deity. 

II Sanskrit yajna, a sacrifice.

Religious days in Bashatir. 471 

The Kdli pujans are called kherid-kdri* in BaBhahr, and include the 
Prefc Puja, Tekar^ and Sarvamandal ^'''^'^j^'''''^- They are obsei'vod in 
Sdwan or PhJigan, and the yag or observance is paid for from the jdgir 
of the deity or from funds supplied by hia deotus\ (devotees), who also 
give grain, ghi, oil and he-goats. On an auspicious day chosen by a 
Brahman as many as 50 he-goats are sacrificed, and the people of the 
neighbourhood are feasted, the priests and deotus receiving the goats' 
heads and fee, with some grain and ghi. 

The ShdndX yag. — In Bashahr the Shdnd yag is celebrated where 
there has been a good crop or an epidemic is raj^ing. Sometimes 108 
halis, sometimes less, are offered, and sacrifices arc also made to the 
ten dishas or quarters. The gods of the four theris and fche five sthdns^ 
('cmples) also assemble at it and other gods from the country round 
attend the yag. The expense incurred is considerable. In Bashahr 
the people also perform the shdnd for their own villages. 

A minor yag, called Sh^ndtu or Bhdtpur|| is alcio observed every 
third year, but not universally. Brahmans perform worship and are 
feasted. 

Less important yags arc the jdgrds and 'iafagrds^ which are observed 
annually or every third or fourth year. The biggest, that of Mahesh- 
war of Sungrd, is held every third year at Nach^r temple, with the 
following rites : — 

Balis (sacrifices) of he-goats are offered on all four sides, and at 
night a combat takes place between the villagers and the gawdls,^"^ who 
are armed with large wooden clubs " having fire burning at the ends." 
The combat lasts all night. The women sing, dance and make merry, 
and are feasted in return. 

In Bashahr the Didoli is observed in Maghar. It is the special festi- 
val of the peasantry, and held only in the village temples. Women 
observe it by visiting their parents' homes and their eathig cold viands. 

The Khappd, held on the 1 5th of Poh in Bashahr, resembles the 
Diaoli in that State. It is probably the festival called Khwakchd, in 
Kanaar. 

The Jal Jdtr^tt held in Jeth in Bashahr is the occasion on which the 
i^dfetirs are bathed in the rivers with songs and music, ' for which the 
performers are rewarded.

472 Superstitions in Bashahr. 

In Bashahr at the Jal or Ban Bib^r the thdkurs' chariots are carried 
out into the gardens, and alms given to Brahmans, musicians, etc. 

The Rdm-naumi is called Dharm-kothi* in Bashahr, and is the occa- 
sion for general rejoicings, the thalcurs' thrones being decorated with 
heaps of flowers, and many thousands of rupees spent. 

In Bashahr the Baisd,khi is called Lahol, and the girls who marry 
their dolls in Pdrbati's name are given money by the State or from the 
bazar. 

As in the Simla Hills, generally, the abandonment of land is called 
sog or mandokri. When a house or field is believed to be occupied by 
a demon it is regained by sacrificing a he-goat in the name of his mane. 
But even then a cultivated field so regained cannot be ploughed, and 
must only be used for pasture. 

An oath in Bashahr is termed dib. It is administered when it is 
impossible to find out the truth of a case, and there is no reliable evi- 
dence. One party agrees to take the oath. First he has a cold bath. 
Then he goes to the temple and says that if he is in the right he ought 
to be successful, but if unsuccessful, in the wrong. Two balls of kneaded 
flour, one containing a silver coin, and the other a gold piece, are put 
in a narrow vessel full of water, and the man is bidden to take one ball 
out. It is then broken, and if it contains the silver, he is supposed to 
be successful, and if the gold, he is deemed to have failed. 

A man can be released from an oath by the thai darohi, which con» 
sists in making a present to the R^ja and also performing a yag, i.e., 
sacrificing a he-goat in honour of the god. 

The 14th of the dark half of Bhdion is termed Krishan chaudas or 
D&gjAM-diaudas (from D&g'Vf6M-chaudas) ; and on that day the wor- 
ship of Kali is observed. It is a general belief in the Punjab hills that 
some women are Dags or Dains, that is to say that a sight of them is 
not lucky, or in other words they know some incantations by which 
they can assume the form of a tiger or vulture, and that any beautiful 
thing which comes into their sight is destroyed. The 14th of the dark 
half of Bhado is their feast day, and they then assemble in the Be^s 
Kund in Kullu, or at some other place, such as the Karol hill, Avhich 
lies between Solan and Kandaghdfc. Some mustard seed is thrown on 
to the fields so that the P^g may not destroy the crops. On that day 
no man goes out from fear of the Dag, and on each house door some 
thorns are stuck with cow-dung, so that the Pag may not enter. 

If a part of a field is left while being sown, worship is made on the 
spot and a he-goat sacrificed because it is unlucky to leave a bit hejindir 
{hanjar, uncultivated). 

Kang. — A tribe of Jats, found chiefly in the angle between the Beas and 
Sutlej, though they have crossed the latter river into Ambdla and 
Ferozepur, and are apparently found in small numbers all along its 
banks and even on the Lower Indus. Their tradition is that they came 
from Grarh Ghazni, but in Amritsar they say they were first settled in

Kang — Kdng-chimpa. 475 

Kiiirpur, near Delhi. Thtw occupied a position of some considerable 
political importance in their own tract, during the early days of Sikh 
rule. Mr. Barkley wrote of the JuUundur Kanj^ :— " Most of the Sikh 
Sardiirs of the Nakodar tah-^il either belong to this tribe, or were con- 
nected with it by marriage whea they estaljlislied their authority ther<>. 
Tara Singh Gheba {sic), who was their loader at the time of the conquest, 
was himself of this race and a native of Kang on the Sutlej, where it is 
said that eighteen Sardars at one time resided ; but on the village being 
swept away by the river they dispersed themselves in their separate 
j'jgirs on both sides of the river." The Kang are said to claim descent 
from the Solar Kajputs of Ajudhia through their ancestor Jogra, father 
of Kang, and in Amritsar give the following pedigree : — 

Rim Chandar. "^

Babd Maiha, son of Mdngu, 6th in descent from Kang, fell in fio-ht 
with the Kheras on the spot which still marks a village boundary, and 
he is now worshipped, Mird-sis taking the offerings made to him. Kan^s 
and Kheras still refuse to intermarry. 

Kang, a Hindu Jat clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery.

Kanq-chimpa, lit. ' great house.' The head of the familv in Spiti, who is 
primarily responsible for the revenue, the corvee and the share of com- 
mon expenses demandable on the whole holding. He is ordinarily the 
eldest son ns primogeniture prevails, but it does not follow that his 
father is dead, for by custom the father retires from the headship of 
the family when his eldest son is of full age and has taken to himself a 
wife. On each estate (jeola) there is a kind of dower house with a plot 
of land attached to which the father in these cases retires. When in- 
stalled there, he is called the hdng-chungpd or small-house-man. 
Sometimes in the absence of a living father, the widowed mother, or 
the grandfather, or an uncle, aunt or unmarried sister, occupies tho 
small house and the land attached to it. A person occupying a separate 
house of even lower degree is called ydng-chungpa, and is always soTue 
relation of the head of the family : he may be the grandfather who has 
been pushed out of the small house by the retirement of his own son, 
the father, but it is commoner to 6nd unmarried sisters, aunts, or their 
illegitimate offspring in this position.^ 

* In Pin Tcothi or villapjo the hozaii familios, desccnrlants of monks of orders which per- 
mit marriage, commonly hold a house and a small plot from the family from whicb they 
sprang, and are in the position of a ydiig-chungpa. For tha fiscal terms en which the 
Mng and ydng-chungpas hold, soe Lyall'a Kaugra Settlement Rep,, § 1-48.

4*?4 Kdng-chumpa^-Kanjar. 

Kang-chumpa, a cottager or farm servant iii Ld,liul. Like tlie chdksi, the 

kang-chumpa does not appear to bo a mere tenant on the garhpdn or 

demesne lands of the Thakm's, but holds on the same tenure as the yulfa 

or dotocn, i.e. as a subordinate proprietor. The kdng-chumija, however, 

pays no rent and do private service only for the Thdkur. His holding 

is a quarter of a y^oZa or less, as against the half or whole jeola of a 

chdksi and the one or two of a dotoen. The family in possession of a 

\ \ holditig of this kind is bound to famish one man or woman for continu- 

^ (\^ ous work at the Thd,kur's house or on his garlpdr land. The person 

\ in attendance gets food and does work of any kind. Those who live at 

' a distance work on the garhpdn land near them, but are also bound to 

feed a sheep for the Thd,kur during the winter. Some kdng-chumpas 

now pay Rs. 5 a year in lieu of service. 

Kangar, Kingar. — The Kangar is a travelling hawker, but he confines his 
traflSc to small articles of earthenware such as pipe-bowls, and especially 
to those earthen images in which native children delight. These he 
makes himself and hawks aboiit for sale. But Baden-Powell gives at 
p. 267 of his Punjab Manufactures a long account of an operation for 
a new nose said to be successfully performed by the Kangars of Kangra. 
/ According to Mr. H. L. Williams the Kingar are also called Ale Bliole 
and are Muhammadans, often suspected of petty pilfering from thresh- 
ing-floors and hen-roosts ; a primitive race whose conditions of life 
resemble the Kuchband. 

Kangiara, a got or section of the Telis. 

Kangrah, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multd^n. 

Kanhia, or (tHANia, the fifth of the Sikh misls or confederacies which was 
recruited from Jats. It derived its name from Ghani, a village near 
Lahore. 

Kanial, a tribe which belongs, according to the late Mr. E. B. Steedman, 
to that miscellaneous body of men who call themselves Rdjputs, hold a 
large portion of the south-eastern corner of the Rawalpindi district, and 
are of much the same class as the Budhal and Bhakral. They also 
appear to stretch along the sub-montane as far east as Gujrat.

Kanjar. (1) The Kanjar of the Delhi territory, or as he seems to be 

called in the Ambdla division the Jallad, is a wandering tribe very 
similar to the Perna j and in that part of the country a pimp or 
prostitute is called Kanchan or by some similar name, and never 
Kanjar. In the remainder of the Punjab the word Kanchan is not 
used, the wandering tribe of Kanjars is apparently not found, and 
Kanjar is the ordinary word for pimp or prostitute. Thus Kanchan and 
Kaniar (including Jalldd) are separately returned in the eastern districts, 
but only Kanjar for the rest of the Province. The Kanchans are 
almost all Musalmdns, while the Kanjars are all Hindus, except in Sirea;

and probably the Musalmdn Kanjars in Sirsa are really Kanchans. 
The Kanjars of the Delhi territory are a vagrant tribe who wander 
about the country catching and eating jackals, lizards, and the like, 
making rope and other articles of grass for sale, and curing boils and 
other diseases. They particularly make the grass brushes used by 
weavers. They are said to divide their girls into two classes; one 
they marry themselves, and them they do not prostitute ; the other 
they keep for puiposos of prostitution. The Kanjars appear to be 
of higher status than the Nat, though they are necessarily outcasts. 
They "worship Mdta, whom thsy also call Kdli Mjii; but whether they 
refer to Kali Devi or to Sitla does not appear, most; probably to the 
former. They also reverence Guga Pir. Delhi is said to be the 
headquarters of the tribe. But the word Kanjar seems to be used in 
a very loose manner ; and it is not certain that these Kanjars are not 
merely a Bauria tribe ; and it is just possible that thev have received 
their name from their habit of prostituting their daughters, from the 
Panjdbi word Kanjar. The words Kanjar and Bangdli also seem 
often to be used as synonymous. Further, to quote Mr. H. L. Williams, 
Sansis in Hindustan and the Districts of the Punjab east of the 
Ghaggar river are known as Kanjars, but the relations between the 
S^msis of the Punjab and the Kanjars of Hindustan are not always 
clear. There are permanent Kanjar colonies in several important 
cantonments, the men being mostly employed in menial offices in 
the barracks while the women attend the females of other castes 
in domestic duties, as cuppers and sick-nurses ; they also sell embroca- 
tions and curative oils. The members of these colonies intermarry on 
equal terms with the wandering Kanjars of the Delhi division, 
journeying down country for the purpose. They admit a relationship 
between The Sansis and the Kanjars of the south, and that they 
speak a common dialect, which may be a thieves' patter or a 'patois 
of their original home. Wandering Sdnsis style themselves Kanjars 
only in the Delhi territory and parts of the east, dropping the name 
when they approach the Sutlej. (2) A J^t clan (agricultural) found

dings in singing the praises of the pair. Tliey are said to conie 
from R^jpatana or the Biigat", where they are known as Hindu Dums. 
The following account appeais to confuse them with the Khappari : — 
In Rohtak the Ktlpri are a Brahman clan, which is divided into two 
classes, tdpashi and kdpri. The story goes that when Mahddeo was 
going to be married, he asked a Brahman to join the pi'ocession and 
ceremony. He refused saying, ' what can I do if I go ? ' Mah^deo then 
gave him two (Shatura flowers and told him to blow them as he 
went along with the procession. He sjiid, ' how can I blow two 
flowers ? ' He then told him to pick up a corpse {kr'tyd) lying {pari) on 
the ground, but it at once rose up and rook the other flower. The 
progeny of the Brahraan were henceforward called tapshi (worshippers) 
and the offspring of the corpse kdpri [hdydpari). 

In N^bha they make cups (dunna) of leaves and also pattaU or 
platters of them. In Ambala they are said to print cloth.

whom they emancipated themselves some t«o centuries ago. Originally 
Hindus, their conversion to Islam is of comparatively modern date.

still slio-lit; and though they now know more of it, and are more careful 
to observe it, relics of their former Hindu faith are still observable in 
their sociul habits. They are attached to their homes and their fields 
which they cultivate simply and industriously. For the rest, their 
character is crafty and cowardly." He further noted that the Karrdla 
are identical in origin and character with the Dhunds. This would 
make the Karrdls on? of the Rajput tribes of the hills lying along the 
left bank of the Jhelum ; and they are said to claim Rdjput origin, though 
they have also recently set up a claim to Kayd^ni Mughal descent, 
in common with the Gakkhars ; or, as a variety, that their ancestor 
came from Kay^n, but was a descendant of Alexander the Great ! But 
the strangest story of all is that a queen of the great Rdja Rasdlu of 
Punjab folklore had by a paramour of the scavenger class four sons, 
Seo, Teo, Gheo, and Karu, from whom are respectively descended the 
Si^ls, Tiw^nas, Ghebas, and Karrd,ls. They intermarry with Gakkhars, 
Sayyids and Dhunds. 

Kartari', Kaltari, a Hindu sect which has sprung up in the south-west of 
the Punjab of late years. Its founder was one Assa, an Arora of 
Bhakkar, in Dera Ismail Khdn, who made disciples not only from among 
the Hindus, but also from among the Musalm^n cultivators of that 
District. The followers of this Pir usually s:o through the ordinary 
business of the world up to noon, after which they will paint their faces 
with tilaks of wonderful patterns and various colours, and will either sit 
in the bazar without uttering a ^yord, even when spoken to, or will 
wander about with fans in their hands. They are indifferent to the 
holy books of either creed. Their behaviour is harmless and the sect 
does not appear to be progressing.

Kashmiri. — The word Kashmiri is perhaps applicable to the members of any 
of the races of Kashmir; but it is commonly used in Kashmir itself to 
denote the people of the valley of Srinagar. In any case the term is a 
geographical one, and probably includes many of what we should in the 
Punjab call separate castes. The cultivating class who form the great 
mass of the Kashmiris proper are probably of Aryan descent, though 
perhaps with an intermixture of Khas blood, and possess marked cha- 
racters. Drew describes them as " large made and robust and of a 
really fine cast of feature," and ranks them as " the finest race in 
the whole continent of India." But their history is, at any rate in re- 
cent times, one of the most grievous suffering and oppression ; and 
they are cowards, liars, and withal quarrelsome, though at the same 
time keen-witted, cheerful, and humorous. A good account of them 
will be found in Drew's Jummoo and Kashmir. 

In the Punjab the term Kashmiri connotes a Muhammadan Kashmiri. 
It is rarely, if ever, applied to a Hindu of Kashmir. The most ip)-

portanfc Kashmiri element in the Punjab is found in the cities of Ludhiana 
and Amritsar, which still contain large colonies of weavers, employed 
in weaving carpets and finer fabrics. Besides theijc, many Kashmiris 
are found scattered all over these Provinces, many being descended from 
those who were driven from Kashmir by the great famine of 1878 into 
the sub-montane districts of the Punjab. Many of the Kashmiris in 
Gujr{it, Jhelum and Attock are, strictly speaking, Cliibhfilis. A full 
account of the Kashmir krdma and. tribes will be found in Sir Walter 
Lawrence's Valley of Kashmir, Ch. XII. The principal tribes returned 
in the Punjab are the Bat, Batti, D^r, Lun, Mahr, Man, Mir, Shaikh, 
Wain and Warde. Ju is also common and like Bat and other tribe- 
names is now practically a surname. A Khokhar tribe — who do not 
intermarry at below 20 years of age — is also found in Ferozepur.

480 Kasrdna — JS^assar. 

Kasrana, a Kharral clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Kasrani, Qaisarani, is the northernmost of the Baloch organised tumans, 
its territory lying on either side of the boundary between the two Deras, 
and being confined to the hills both within and b^^yond our frontier 
and the sub-montane strip. 'I'he tribe is a poor one, and is divided into 
seven clans, tlie Lashkarani, Rubadan, Khepdin, Buddni, Wasu^ni, 
Leghari, Jar war and Bada, none of which are important. They are of 
Rind origin, and are not found in the Punjab in any numbers beyond 
the Dera Ghazi and Dera Ismail Kh^n districts. 

Kassar. — The Kassars hold the grnater part of the norfch-wesfc quarter of the 
Cliakwal tahsil in Jhelum, and as far as is known are not found in any 
numbers in any other part of the Province : Ibbetson (Census Keport, 
§ 508) remarks that until 1881 they seem to have enjoyed the rare dis- 
tinction of being one of the few Salt Range tribes which claimed neither 
Kdiput, Awan, nor Mughal descent, but according to Bowring they 
once claimed Rajput origin* asserting that their original home' was in 
Jammu ; and that they obtained their present territories by joining the 
armies of Bdbar ; most of them, however, recorded themselves as Mughals 
at the Census ot 1881, a claim ''evidently suggested by their association 
with the Mughal power": this claim has now developed into a genea- 
logical tree in which the Kassars are shown as being of common origin 
with the Mughal emperors. Their present account of their origin is as 
follows : — 

" They were originally located in the country of Kinan in Asia Mioor, whence they 
migrated to Ghazni at some time unknown with the ancestors of the Mughal dynasty, 
and subsequently accompanied Babar in his invasion of India in A. D. 1526, their ances- 
tors at that time being Gharka and Bhin (or Bhol), according to some ; or Jajha, Lati and 
Kaulshi according to others : all agree, however, in stating that Gharka is baried on a 
mound in Mauza Hatar, not many miles from Dhok Pipli in Bfil Kassar, which is said to 
be the original settlement ot the tribe in these parts. The Dhanni was then in tbe hands 
of wandering Gnjars, while Changas Khan Janjua held the hills to the south, living at 
Fort Samarqand near Mmoza Maira. Babar made over to them the western part of tho 
Dhanni, on condition that they would drain off the water with which the eastern part 
was then covered, a work which they proceeded to carry out: and Gharka obtained soma 
additional country to the south-west as a reward for restoring to Changas Khan a 
favourite mare, which the Janjua Raja had lost. 1 hey claim that the name, Baluki Dan, 
under which the tract figures in tho Aiu-i-Akbari, is derived from that of their ancestor 
Bhal, who also gave his name to the important village of Bal Kassar ; and in this they 
are supported by the spelling of the lithographed edition of the Ain-i-Akhari, against the 
assertion of the Janjuas, that the name is Maluki Dhan, from the Janjua chief, Mai of 
Malot. They explain the presence now of the Mairs and Kahiits in the Dhanni by stating 
that, as relations of the reigning dynasty they were themselves able to keep out all intru- 
ders in the time of the Mughals ; but in Sikh rule the Mairs, being of the same stock as 
the powerful Jammu Raja, were able to obtain a footing in the tract : they generally 
admit that the Kahiits came with them in Babar's train and settled here at the same 
time as themselves, but say that they were of small account until the time of tho 
Sikhs. They state that the original profession of the tribe was ' hdhumat ' or govern 
ment; and that it is now agriculture or Government employment. They use the title 
of chaudhri. They have no special Pirs or places of worship, and their customs do not 
differ in any respect from those of the tribes surrounding them, except that the graves of 
women are distinguished by stone at the head and foot parallel to the breadth of the 
grave, while those of meu'vS graves are parallel to the length ; -this is just the opposite of 
the custom in the Jhelum Pabbi." 

Whatever may be thought of tbe claim of the Kassars to rank as 
Mughals, they certainly have a good position amongst the tribes of the 
District, ranking in popular estimation with the Mdir?. and Kahuts, they 

* J. A. S. B., 1850, pp. 43—64 (the Kahuts also claimed Rajput descent). 



Kat^Kathdl. 481 

intermarry freely with the former, both giving and taking daughters : 
but a Kassar of good family who married his daughter to a Kahut of 
fair standing incurred the displeasure of tlie brotherhood : they do not 
intermarry with any other tribe, thouofh as is usually the case in the 
Jhelum district low caste wives are occasionally taken by them. Mdirs, 
Kassars and Kahuts eat together, but not wif,h kamins. 

The doggerel rhymes of the tribal Mirasis contain little of interest, 
either setting forth in extravagant terms the power of individual chiefs 
of bygone generations, oi- recording the incidents of the comparatively 
recent internecine feuds of the tribe : the following is well known, and 
another version is given by the Mdirs also : — 

Charhid Bdhar Bddshdh ; Kahdr tamhu tande : 
Bhin te Gharkd Kassar doen ndl de. 

" Bdbar B^dsh^h marched, and pitched his tent at (Kalla) Kahdr : 
Bhin and Gharkd,, the Kassars, both came."

The earlier part of the tree connecting the tribe with Bdbar is obvi- 
ously fanciful, and the latter part not altogether reliable. Such names 
as Tilochar, Nand, Pres, etc., are mixed up with Muharamadan names 
ill thefoi'mer part, while a Jhan Deo occurs low down in the tree : these 
names may indicate a Hindu origin, though the tradition of the tribe is 
that they were Musalmitos long before they came to these parts. About 
35 generations on the average intervene between Kassar and members 
of the tribes now living. In character they resemble the Mdirs.

Kathia. — One of tlie Great Rd,vi tribes, and next in importance amoug them 
to the Kharral. The Kd,tliias claim to be Punvvar Rdjputs, and are 
almost confined to the Havi valley of the Multan and Montgomery 
District?, but they hold a considerable area in the south of Jhang, which 
they are said to have acquired from the Kamldna Sid.ls in return for aid 
afforded to the latter against the Naw^b of Multd.n. The Kdthias once 
practised female infanticide. Previouj'ly they had lived on the Rivi 
and in the lower part of the Sdndal B^v. They were supposed to be the 
same people as the Kathaei, who in their stronghold of Sd,ngla so stout- 
ly resisted the victorious army of Alexander. The question was elabo- 
rately discussed by Sir Alexander Cunningham at pp. 33 to 42 of Vol. 11 
of his Archmological Rp/ports, and in Vol. I, p, 101^ of Tod's Rdjasthdn 
{Madras Reprint, 1880). Captain Elphinstone thus described them in 
his Montgomery Settlement Repoj^t : — 

" The remarkable fact that a people called ' Kathaioi ' occupied a part of the Gugaira 
district when Alexander invaded the Punjab, invests the Kathia tribe with a peculiar 
interest. After much enquiry on the subject, I have come to the conclusion that the 
Kathias of the present day have a strong claim to be considered the descendants of 
the same ' Kathaioi ' who so gallantly resisted the Macedonian conqueror. Their own 
account of their origin is, of course, far different. Like all Jats they take a particular 
pride in tracing their descent from a Rajput prince about the time of their conversion to 
Muhammadanism under the Emperor Akbar. But an examination of their alleged pedigree 
shows that, like many other popular traditions of this kind, this account of their origin 
must be altogether fictitious. They state that a prince named ' Khattya,' reigning in 
Rajputana, was compelled to yield up one of his sisters in marriage to the emperor of 
Delhi. After brooding for some time over this great outrage to Rijput honour, he contrived 
to assemble a large army with which he attacked the imperial forces : he was, however, 
overcome by superior numbers, and was made a prisoner after nearly all his adherents had 
been slain. Ho was then conducted with great honour to the Court of Delhi, where the 
emperor treated him with kindness, and at last induced hira to embrace the Muhammadan 
faith, and placed under his charge an important post near the Court. Some time afterwards 
he was sent with a force to subdue a portion of the Ravi tribes who had risen in insur- 
rection, and after conquering them was so much attracted by the beauty of the country, 
that he remained and received a grant of the whole tract for himself and his descendants. 
All the Kathias claim descent from this prince, but, unfortunately for the credibility of this 
story, the only way that his 8,00(J descendants manage to arrange the matter is by assuming 
that the prince had no less than 150 sons; whilst in a pedigree prepared by the chief 
Mirasi of the tribe, in which the increase of offspring in the different generations is arranged 
with more accordance to probability, the line is only brought down to a few of the principal 
families of the tribe. 

" In their habits the Kathias differ little from the other Jat tribes. Before the accession 
of Ranj It Singh they lived chiefly on cattle grazing and plunder. Like the Kharrals and 
Fattianas they still keep up Hindu paro/u7s, who take a prominent part at all marriage 
festivities, an undoubted sign of their conversion to Muhammadanism having been of recent 
date. They are n handsome and sturdy race, and like nearly all Jats of the ' Great Ravi ' 
do not allow their children of either sex to marry until they have attained the age of 
puberty, because, as they justly consider, too early marriages would be detrimental to the 
'physique' of the race. Their chief and favourite article of food is buttermilk; the 
consumption of wheat among them is very inconsiderable." 

Mr. Purser, Iiowever, gave a somewhat different account of their 
migrations. He said : — 

" The Kathias have been identified with the ' Kathaioi ' of Alexander's time. According 
to their account they are descended from Raja Karan, Sdrajbansi, Originally they resided 
in Bikaner, whence they emigrated and founded the State of Kathiawan From there they 
went to Sirsa and then to Bahawalpur. Next they crossed over to Kabula and went on to

Daira Dinpanah. Here they quarrelled with the Balochis and had to leaTe. They then 
settled at Mi'rah Sial in Jhang. They stole the cattle of A14wal Khan of Karailia, who wai 
killed pursuing them. Saadat Yar Khan obtained the release of their leaders (who were 
imprisoned on account of this al!air) on condition of their settling on the Ravi. Thus the 
Kathias obtained a footing in this District. They always held by the Kamalia Kharrals, 
but plundered the others whenever they could get a chance. The Kathias arc Punwar 
Rajputs. There are two main divisions ; the Kithias proper and the Baghelas.' * 

This would make the Kdtliias of the Rdvi immif^ranta from Kathiawdr. 
But a Pandit of Guzerat who was sent into the Punjab by the tlaja of 
•Jazddn, one of the principal Kathiawar States, to make enquiries on the 
subject, found that the Kathiawar Rajputs, who also claim descent from 
Riija Karan, have a tradition that they came to their present territory 
from the Punjab via Sindli and Kach. The Kcithia tradition i.s that 
they were driven out of Sirsa Kania, or the valley of the lower Ghaggar, 
about the time of Tamerlane's iuvasion. Balwdna and Pawar are two 
leading clans. 

In recent times the tribe has in Jhang been going from bad to worse, 
and it is now of little importance in that District. 

Kathuea, an Ardin clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Katil, a Rdjput clan found in Gurddspur. Their founder Raja Karet, 
driven from the plains in the time of Mahmud of Ghazni, settled 
in Mangla Devi, a fort in Jammu and thence raised Kharipur, 
whence his descendants became known as Khokhars. They still 
hold large estates in Jammu. One of them took to robbery in tho 
forest round Sd,nibha,t and thence seized a Sambidl girl, so her 
kinsmen gave hioi a large tract of land in iShakargarh tahsil. In this 
he founded Katli and his descendants were called Katils. The tribe 
founded 360 villages, of which there remain only 100, 60 in British 
territory and 40 in Jammu. The Kd,tils claim to be Surajbansi, and 
descended from B^wd Sihi, regarding the Mahajans, Kuprds, Aswdrs 
(horse-tamers), Chamilrs, Batwd,ls and Dumn^s as branches or off- 
shoots of the tribe, whose observances those castes follow. 

In Aurangzeb's time the Katils, Rao, Balel, Mai and Nihdla became 
Muhammadans, but remained Katils by caste. 

The Katils do not intermarry with the higher Rcijput septs, such as 
the Sambidl, but they intermarry with a number of the Rdjput septs of 
Jammu, as well as with the Lalotari and Deowania, and the Thakkar 
septs. Intermarriage with the Khokhars is prohibited because they 
are regarded as akin to the Katil by descent. 

This is basefl on the following tradition : — ' Brahma, who was de- 
scended from Suraj (sun), Mirichak, Kdsyab after whom our got (sub- 
caste) is named, Taran, Kavan, 8ompat, Brihaspat, Avagyddhdtd, 
Dayadhdta, Mahdndhiita, Beaspdl, Ratanpdl, Atter, Rc'ijd Sahasranar, 
Santan Raja, Karet Raja, Kood Rajd, Rti];! Chit, Rdja Gora, Bharath, 
Rd]d vSantal, Rdja B.iil and Rajii Jasrath took possession of the fort of 
Mangla Devi in the Khari territory and settled there. His descendants 
thus became known as Khokhars, and still hold lands in the Jammu 
State though they have become Muhammadans.^

retainers of the Kathia originally.

494 '^^^ Katoch. 

Kelan who was descended from Bani, Sugga., and Sai settled at 
Katli in Jammu and his descendants became known as Kdtals. 

Paian, Khang, Gaga, Dheru and Ld,dd, were the ancestors of Bhura 
who founded the village Bhure Chak and named it after himself. Lad ha, 
the son of Kundan and erandson of Bdnoa had two sons : — Nihd,la 
and Surjan. Nibd,la founded NihdU Chak. Rughal was the son of 
Surjan. 

Dharevca, also called udhdld, is practised by the Kdtils,* even Brahman 
widows being espoused under this system. But the offspring of such 
unions are looked down upon and find it difficult to obtain wives, 
thouo-h they succeed equally with the children of full legitimacy, 
Dharewa is most usually contracted with a man of the husband's family 
and, provided the second husband declares that the widow is his wife 
before all the brotherhood, no rite is necessar}'' or customary. But if 
she marry outside her husband's family she loses the custody of his 
children ;" and she forfeits her right to succeed to his property if she re- 
marry. 

The Brahmans of the Katils must be of the Manutara or S^rsut 
branch, and of the Kasyapa gotra, as they themselves are. 

Ill the government of the tribe a learned Brahman is associated with 
a leading man of good position and influence, who is elected from time 
to time, not for life but for an indefinite period. He alone, or in 
consultation with 3 or 4 members of the brotherhood, decides all 
disputes. Many disputes are decided by oaths — a deponent being 
made to bathe and touch a plpal, a temple or an idol, or to hold his 
sou in his arms, and then swear. Boundary disputes are settled by 
one of the parties placing a clod of earth on his head and walking along 
what he declares to be the true boundary. This is a very solemn oath 
as if sworn falsely the earth will refuse to receive him. 

The only tribal cult of the Katils appears to be that of their satisf 
whose tombs still exist at Katli, to which place pilgrimages are made 
twice a year. But the Katils have various other cults in common with 
other Riljput tribes on the Jammu border. Such are Kali Bir, Vaishno 
Devi, B^wa Sd,rgal, a snake god, B. Sadda Garia besides the better- 
known Lakhdatta, Narsinghji, Bhairon Ndth and others. 

Katoch. The generic name of the dynasty whose original capital was at 
JuUundur but whose territories were subsequently restricted to the 
Kangra hills. The kingdom whose capital was at Jullundur (Jd,landhara) 
was called Trigarta, but the name of its dynasty does not appear to 
be recorded, and the name Katoch is confined to the house of Kangra. 
From it sprang four or five branches, the Jaswdls or rulers of the 
Jaswan Duu in Hoshi^rpur, the Goleria, once rulers of Guler or 
Haripur in Kangra, the Sib^ia or Sip^ia of Siba in Kangra and 
the Dadwals of Datarpur on the borders of Kd.ngra in Hoshid,rpur. 
A fifth branch which claims Katoch descent is the Luddu Rajput

sept. The Katoch are by status Jaikaria Rajputs of the 1st grade. 
The Goleria represent the elder line and from it sprang the Siba and 
Dadwal^ the Jaswdl being an offshoot of the main branch. 

Kator, a race mentioned by several Muhammadan historians of India. 
Baihaki in his Tdrikli-i-Sabaktigin mentions that all the Hindu 
Kators were brought under the rule of the Sultan Mas'ud^ but he 
does not specify their locality.* Abu Rihdn at Biruni speaks of 
Katormdn as the last of the Turk kings of Kdbul,t but the dynasty 
appears to have been also called Katormdn, Katorian or Kayormdn.J 
Elliot gives a full account; of them, but it is doubtful if the dynasty 
was generally called Katormdn.§ Taimur Iiowevor unquestionably 
found the Kators in alliance with the Sidhposh and holding a kingdom 
which extended from the frontier of Kashmir to the mountains of 
Kabul and contained many towns and villages. Their ruler was called 
'Addlshuj Udd, or Udashu (which recalls Udiiyana or Swd,t) and had 
his capital at Jorkal. He describes the Kators as men of a powerful 
frame and fair complexion^ idolaters for the most part, and speaking 
a tongue distinct from Turki, Persian, Hindi or Kashmiri. || Taimur 
attacked their strongholds, readiing, according to RavGrty,that part of 
Kdfiristdn known as Kashtur while the prince Rustam advanced into 
those parts where the Kiitibi, Siahposh, Pd,ndu and Sdldo now dwell.H 
This was in 1398 A.D., and in the end of the ]5th century Sultdn 
Mahmud, a descendant of Taimur led expeditions against the Kator 
Kdfirs and Sidhposh and thereby earned the title of Ghdzi. Raverty 
identi6es the Kator with the Spin or White Kd;rirs,*'* but the historians 
of Akbar, who sent an expedition under Jahdngir in 1581 against the 
Sid,hposh Kiifirs of the mountains of Kator, and Abu'l Fazl in his 
history of Taimur's expedition speak of the Hindud^n-i-Kator, a 
country which they describe as bounding Buner, Swd,t and Bajaur 
on tbe north. The family of the Mihtar of Chitrdl is still called Kator 
(vide p. 174 supra), and Biddulph's proposed identification of the 
Kathiar or Khattar of Attock cannot be regarded as proved.tl"

Kehal. — A nomad tribe of fishermen and boatmen, who ply their boats 
between Kaldbagh and Sakkar on the Indus, rarely if ever quitting the 
valle V of that river. But Malld,hs, described as Jhabel by caste and 
Kehal by got are found in Ludhidna, and doubtless elsewhere. 

The Kehals claim to be the earliest converts to Islam between Kalabagh 
and Karachi, but profess to follow Imd,m Sh^fi, and eat unclean animals 
and fish found in the Indus in spite of the Qur^n. 

Thus their favourite food is the flesh of the sisdr or long-nosed fish- 
eating crocodile, but they avoid that of the bagu or snub-nosed crocodile. 
Centuries ago the Kehals had a saint, one Chacha Mith^, of their own 
tribe, but nothing is known of his life or history. 

Like the ^;!oh^nas and Jhabels the Kehals invoke " Dum Diu-pan^h," 
Dum Bahdwal Haqq, Lai Is^ and Aili Rdjin or simply Aili.* 

The Kehals are said to have no belief in devils, but the Mohdnas and 
Jhabels hold that any disease is due to demoniacal possession and that 
these demons of disease belong to certain saints of the neighbouring 
tracts, such as Ldl Isd. of Karor, Aili R^jin, Dinpand,h, Jamman Sh^h, 
etc. These demons have human names such as Gord Khetripd,l, Ziulf 
Jam^l, Nur Jamdl, Nur Muhammad, Chingu, GhuMm Rasdl, Kundai, 
Shabr^tin, etc., etc., and of these the last two are iemsile jinns. Women 
are most commonly possessed and they promptly inform their relatives 
of the yarn's name, and which saint he or she belongs to. Children of 
both sexes have to swim when 5 years of age and are expert in swim- 
ming and diving by the time they are 10. 

Fishing is practised at any time of the day or night, but avoided on 
Fridays, and forbidden on the day when a wedding is being celebrated. 
Alligators are caught in the following way : a back-water or pool which 
forms a branch of the main stream is chosen and a heavy net, in which 
is a large opening, is placed across its mouth. A putrescent carcase 
or fish bones are placed m the pool as bait, and four Kehals lie in 
ambush on the bank. When the alligator is seen inside the pool two

of the hunters rush to close the hole in the net, while the other two 
drive the animal into it, or harass it until it is tired ont, when it is 
speared and killed. Occasionally a man is bitten but fatal bites are 
very rare. Tortoises are killed in a similar way. Sometimes in shallow 
pools nets are unnecessary, and in the cold season when alligators, 
tortoises and large fish lie concealed in the mud at the Ijottom of the 
shallow streams and back-waters the Kchals prod it with their spears 
and kill the animals before they can escape. Fish are sometimes caught 
by stirring up the mud until they float half-dead on the surface. 

Kehals ply their boats for hire, sell baskets and mats, reap crops for 
hire and beg for grain. They do not sell fish in the bazars of a town. 

Birth customs, — A first-born child, if a boy, is peculiarly auspicious 
and if a daughter, unlucky. It is very unlucky to have three daughters 
and still worse to have a son after three girls, as he never fails to cause 
his mother's or father's death within 3 years. Great rejoicings are 
held for a first-born son, midlahs, Sayyids, eunuchs and their followers 
being feasted. On the 3rd day a boy is named, and on the 7th his head 
is shaved. A girVs head is merely shaved on the 7th day, and her ears 
pierced in 10 or 15 places before she is 5, Kehal women do not pierce 
the nostril for the nose-ring. A boy is circumcised before he is 10 by 
a pirahin, precisely as he is among the Baloch. He is made to put on 
a gdnd or string of red cotton thread round his right wrist, a piece of 
cotton cloth H yards long by ^ wide, as a tahmat, and a second piece 
about 3 yards long for a />ag'ri, but his kurta should bo white. If a 
mosque is handy, he is taken to it, followed by drummers who dance 
and sing. A new earthen fardt or jar is placed on the ground at the 
gate and on it the boy is seated witli his feet on the ground. A man 
holds his hands back while the 'pirahin operates. 

Marriage. — Muhammadan rites are observed at wedding?, but one or 
two points deserve notice. The boats, etc., are swept and all bones and 
refuse removed to make them fit to receive strangers. The bride is 
dressed in red {chiini, choli and ghaghard) : the bridegroom in white 
(pagrif kurta and tahmat). The day before the nikdh drummers and an 
eunuch are called in to dance and sing. Muhajnmadan friends also 
come with their own cooking vessels and kill two or more goats or 
sheep. On these they feast, giving a share to the Kehals, but no 
Kehal may approach while the animals are being killed, cooked or eaten. 
After mid-day they all play, dance and sing together, going home in the 
evening. Next day all re-assemble at the same place, the nikdh is read, 
the strangers withdraw, after congratulating tho bridegroom and his 
parents. The bride and bridegroom are then shut up together in a hut 
of reeds for an hour or two to consummate the marriage, and the 
ceremonies close. The cost of the wedding falls on the boy's father, but 
the bride's dress, ornaments, if any, and the household chattels are 
provided by her father. 

Unlike other j^luhammadans a married Kehal goes to live permanent- 
ly with his father-in-law and subsequently becomes his heir. If he is a 
minor at the time of his wedding he continues to live in his father's 
house till of age. A newly married wife waits 6 months and if not 
pregnant by then she gets herself circumcised, whereon pregnancy usu- 
ally ensues. 



488 Kejah—Ketwdl. 

>SMcees5Z07i.— Daughters and sons share equally in their father's pro- 
perty, and disputes regarding succession are said to be decided by the 
mulldhs according to Muharamadan Law. 

The Kehals are divided into three groups, Loria, Dapliala and Mor^ ; 
of which the first is the chief. It is said to derive its name from the 
mullah, a Lori of Luristd,n^ who first taught them IsMra. The Daphala 
are so called because they have large mouths,"^ and the Mor^ because 
they have dark complexions. 

Closely akin to the Kehals, or at least allied to them by occupation 
and habits, are the Jhabelsf and Moh^nas. The latter are said to be 
More-h^nd or "" allied to the Mord" branch of the Kehals and they have 
two divisions, the Kutpd.1 and the Rora. Kutpdl is said to mean " feeder 
(pciZ) of a large city or army" [kut], because centuries ago a largo 
force of a king of Multd,o who had met with defeat was marching west- 
wards to cross the Indus and the Kutp^ls supplied it with fish, in return 
for which its leader taught them to avoid eating unclean animals and 
made them perfect Moslems. But it is also said that many Kehals have 
become MohAnas, Jhabels or Mancheras, since the introduction of 
Isld,m, and taken to cultivation. In former times these tribes were wont 
to combine against a common enemy.

Kesar-shahi. — On the death of Faqir Sayyid Mir Shdh, also styled Mian 
Mir (from whom the Cantonment of Lahore took its former name) 
Sayyid Bhd,wan Shdh of Nurpur Chaumak in Jammu succeeded him as 
faqir, and conferred that same title upon his friend Ibrahim Khd.n a 
znmiiuldr of the Gujrdnwd,la district. When the latter died his son 
GhuMm Shdh became faqir. He was in turn succeeded by his son 
Kesar Sh^h who founded a sect. He died aged 65 in 1863 and his son' 
Muhammad Husain or Sube Sh^h, then became its leader. Hindus as 
well as Muhammadans can enter it, and the latter, though supposed 
to follow the Qiidria tenets, do not abstain from wine, do not fast or 
pray, and are fond of sport. When a new member is admitted there 
is no ceremony, nor is he bound to adhere to any prescribed mode of 
life. Members of this sect are found in Gujr^nwala, Siiilkot, Shiihpur, 
Gujr^t and Lahore. 

Ketvjal, a Rajput tribe in Rawalpindi. It belongs to the same group of 
tribes as the Dhund and Satti, and holds the hills to the south of the

thus described them : "Tho Khaggas came to the Montgomery district 
after the conquest of Multdn by Ran jit Singh. They claim to be 
Qureshi, and name as the first Khagga, Jalal-ul-din, disciple of 
Muhammad Iraq. Khagga is said to mean a peculiar kind of fish ; and 
the name was given to Jalal-nl-din by his spiritual teacher on the 
occasion of his rescuing a boat overtaken by a storm." In Multdn the 
Khaggas own land in Multan and Mailsi tahsils and are still rej/arded 
with a certain amount of respect. In the troublous days before Sawaa 
Mai if any one was distressed he took refuge with a Khagga, and if a 
marauder entered a Khagga's house he was miraculously struck blind.

Khalil, a tribe of the Grhoria Khel Pathans. It occupies the left bank of 
the Blra river, and the country along the front of the Khyber in the 
Peshawar plains between that pass and the Daudzai. Of its four main 
clans, Matuzaij Barozai, Ishd.qzai and Tilarzai, the Barozai is the most 
powerful. The Khali 1 are not good cultivators. According to Raverty 
the Khalils were in the early Mughal period an exceedingly power- 
ful tribe, the strongest among the Ghwaria or Ghoria Pathdns, and 
having compelled the Khashi Pathans many years before to abandon 
Gara and Nushki they first occupied part of Bd,jaur with some of 
Yusafzais about 1517 A. D., but they subsequently drove their allies 
out of that teiritory,t and in 1550 we find them in possession of the 
country immediately west of the Khyber. Like the Mohmands they 
threw in their lot with Kamriin and took part in the attack on Huma- 
yun's camp in which Hindal lost his life. They must have suffered 
heavily in Kainran's final defeat by Humayun. But the real cause of 
their downfall was the hostility of the Khashi Afghans. Holding, as 
they did, all the country from Dhdka to Attock, with the Khyber and 
Kharappa passes, they had become very rich, for the Peshawar district 
was very fruitful and as the royal road lay through it and all the trad- 
ing caravans halted at Bagrdm (Peshawar), the Khalils levied tolls on 
them in return for escorts, and as their wealth increased so did their

.JuUundur, is said to have borne the title of Khalifa Irshad, ' the expounder of the orders 
of God; 

t Elsewhere Raverty gives a fuller account of these operations in Bajaur. He relates 
how a portion of the Khalils having quarrelled with the other Ghoria Khel, left Tarnak and 
Kalati-Ghibai and settled in the Lashora valley iu B'ijaur. Then in alliance with the 
Yusufzais and Mandars they defeated the Dilazaks under Malik Haibu and partitioned 
Bajaur among themselves and their allies, but they soon fell out with them and drove them 
out of Bajaur. The Yijsufzai and Mandar, however, soon combined with the Umr Khel 
Dilazaks and, though the Khalils retreated to the fastnesses of the Hindu-Raj range, 
they secured the help of the Hindu- Raj is, who were probably Arabs, and surrounded the 
Khalils in the Chharmang valley. Here the Khalils were completely defeated and lost 
so many captives that Khalil boys and maidens were sold for a pot a-piece, until Malik 
Ahmad and other chiefs of Yusuf /-ai and Mandar directed that all the Khalil prisoners should 
be set free. The Khalils however never regained B'ijaur.

arrogance. The plundor of a Yusufzai caravan, the murders of tho 
two sons of the Malik of the Abazai and of the Gagidni Mahk, wlio was 
venerated as a saint, iu a Khalil mosque, roused the Kliashis and tlioir 
alHes to fury and under Khdn Kaju they overthrew the Khali Is at 
Shaikh Tapur in 1549 or 1550, according to Raverty.'^ 

The present Khalil tappa or tribal area consists of a tract 20 miles 
long by 10 broad along the foot of the Khyber hills from the Kdbul 
river southward to the Mohmand tappa. It is 73 square miles in area. 
In great measure resembling the Yusufzais tlie Khalils wear in winter 
dark blue coats of quilted cotton which are discarded in summer for a 
large Afghd,n skirt. A white and blue turban, with a lungi twisted round 
the waist or thrown over the shoulder completes the costume. Shdh 
Jah^n conferred the title of arhcibt on Muhammad Asil Khao, Khalil, 
and their chiefs have borne it ever since, instead of the older title of 
maliJc. The arbahs all belong to the Mitha Khel section. 

Khalj, an extinct tribe of Turk origin, claiming descent from Khalj, son of 
Y^fist (Japheth), according to one tradition. It was akin to the Ghuzz. 
A portion of this groat tribe was settled in Garmsir, and some held 
lands in Nangrahar, north of the Kirmdn district, several centuries 
before the Afghans came into it. The pressure of tho Mughal invasions 
however compelled them to move eastwards, and in tlie latter part of 
the year 623 H. a body of Khalj, which formed part of the Khwdrazmi 
forces, overran Mansura, in Sewist/ui. It was however overthrown by 
Ndsir-ud-Din Kab^jah and its chief slain. The Khalj gave sovereigns 
to Lakhnauti (Bengal), but as a tribe it never established itself in 
India. The Khalj are entirely distinct from the Ghilzai Pathdns. 

Khalsa.— The ISikh Commonwealth. According to CunnincTham§ tlie Kh^lsa 
were the followers of Govind Singh, as opposed to the KhuUsa, or 
followers of Ndnak. He adds that the Surbat Khalsa or whole Sikh 
people met once a year at Ararirsar. The terms KhuLisa and Surbat 
Khalsa are now obsolete, the latter being replaced by Tat Khdlsa.

Khand, an agricultural clan found in Shilhpur. It is, however, mainly 
found in Peshd-war, occupying a few villages east of the city of that 
name. It claims indeed to have once occupied the whole country be- 
tween Peshdvvar and Nowshera. Folk-eiymology derives its name from 
tho Hindko word hkand, ' one whosa front teeth arc broken,' because its 
ancestor once received in battle a blow on the face which broke his front 
teeth. Another derivation is from khand, ' sugar,' because the tribe

492 Khand custom, 

once entertained a king who had come into its territory to hunt with 
bread and sugar. The name no doubt; suggests some connection with 
Gandhdra, the ancient name of the Peshawar valley, but the tribal 
tradition is that Mahmud of Ghazoi on his return from one of his 
expeditions to Hindu9td,n brought the Khands back with hiin from some 
part of the Punjab and settled them in the Peshdwar valley which was 
then uninhabited and filled with thick jungle.^ The tribe, on the other 
hand, says it was converted to Islam before the time of Mahmud's con- 
quests, though its head assumed his name as a compliment, to him. Its 
leader.^, who affect; the title of arhdh, claim descent from this Mahmud 
Khdxi and his brother Muhammad Kh^n. In appearance the Khands 
do not differ from the other inhabitants of the valley, and the ordinary 
tribesmen are hardly distinguished from their Awd,n neighbours. In- 
deed they are often called, and call themselves, AwiCns, though the 
latter tribe does not admit the kinship. The Khands however claim to 
be superior to the Awd-ns, and the ham ins or menials of Khand villages 
are actually called Awdns. Both tribea speak Hindko as well as Pashto. 

The Khands commonly intermarry with Awans, as well as with 
Pathdns ; and marriage with the kamins who are called Awdns 
is also allowed provided they do not follow an unch-an occupa- 
tion. Marriage with impure castes such a*^ Mochis and Cham^rs is 
also forbidden. The Khands have no sub-divisions, though they 
are divided into about a score of hirddaris or brotherhoods which 
all intermarry, except that the arhdbs only form alliance with the 
birddari, named Ld,la, which is descended from Muhammad Khan. 
Outsiders of good caste are admitted into the tribe, if they wish it, 
on marriage with a Khand woman, but, unlike other married Khands, 
when visiting their wives^ parents they are not admitted into the 
women's apartments. There is no ceremony of admission. Marriage 
is sometimes infant, sometimes adult, and it is permistiible between 
cousins german. Marriages are arranged by the parents, any other 
beino' viewed with disfavour. Adult marriage is usual at from 15 
to 20 for boys and from 13 to 16 for girls, and mari'iatje at a later age 
for girls is unknown, a girl who remains unmarried in her father's 
house being honoured rather than despisedt and succeeding on his 
death to a full share of his estate for life. Adultery is regarded with 
abhorrence, the man being heavily fined by a jirga of bis fellow-villagers 
and the woman divorced by her husband under the pressure of public 
opinion. In all othi-r observances, such as weddings and funerals, 
the general Muhammadan custom prevails, but inheritance is governed 
by custom not by Muhammadan Law. The Khands are Suunis and 
affect four well known zidrats within their borders, viz., those of 
Akhun Darweza Sahib, Mid,n Shaikh Urar S^hib, Akhun Panja Sdhib, 
and K^ka Sahib. None of these was a Khand or has any particular 
connection with the tribe. Annual fairs are held at their shrines. 
The most noteworthy is that of the Kdka S^hib, which takes place 



* Contrast this tradition with the statement made in the history of the Khalils, at the 
time of whose advent to the Peshawar valley it was extremely fertile. The Khalil chiefs 
are also styled arhdb.

alluded to.

Khanzada. — A tribe of Rajputs, practically conBned to the Gurg^on district 
in the Punjab but also found in Alwar, in which State, Captain Powlett 
thus described them : — 

" They are the Mew4ti chief;) of tho Persian historians, who were probably the repre- 
sentatives of the ancient Lords of Mewat. These Mewatis are called Khanz^das, a race 
which, though Musalm^n like the .Meos, was and is socially far euperior to the Meoa, and 
has no love for them; but who in times past have united with them in the raids and 
insurrections for which Mewafc was so famous, and which made it a thorn in the side of 
Delhi emperors. In fact, the expression Mewati usually refers to the ruling class, while 
Meo designates the lower orders. The latter term is evidently not of modern Origin, 
though it is not, I believe, met with in history ; and the former is, I think, now unusual 
Khanzada having taken its place. 

"The Khaazadas are numerically insignificaut, and they cannot now be reckoned among 
the arishocracy. In social rank tliey are far above rho Meos, and though probably of more 
recent Hiudu extraction, they are better Musalmans. They observe no Hindu festivals 
and will not acknowledge that thoy pay any respect to Hindu shrines. But Brahmans 
take part in their marriage contracts, and they obseive some Hindu marriage ceremonies. 
Though generally as poor and ignorant as the Meo3, they unlike the latter say their 
prayers, and do not let their women work in the Belds. 

"They are not first-rate agriculturists, the seclusion of their women giving them a 
disadvantage beside most other castes. Some have emigrated and taken to trade in the 
Gangetic cities, but these have no connection now with the original Kh4nzada country. 
Those who have not abandoned the traditions of their clan are often glad of military ser- 
vice, and about fifty are in British resjiments. In the service of .^he Alwar State there are 
many. There are 26 Khanzada villages in the State, in most of which the proprietors 
themselves work iu the field and follow the plough. 

"The term Khanzada is probably derived from Khanazad, for it appears that Bahadur 
N4har, the first of the race mentioned in the Persian histories, associated himself with 
the turbulent slaves of Firoz Shah after the deith of the latter, and, being a pervert 
would contemptuously receive the name of Khanazad (slave) from his brethren. The 
Kh4nzadas themselves indignantly repudiate thi-t derivation, and say the word is Eh4n 
J4dd (or Lord Jadii), and was iatenJei to render still nobler the name of the princely 
Rijpnt race from which they came. Converted Jadus were called by the old Muaalm4n 
historians Mew4lis, a term Ohand applies to a Mewat chief of the Lunar race, of which 
race the JAdd Mahar4ja of Kasauli calls himself the head." 

To this Mr. Channing added :— 

" Khanzidas are a race who were formerly of much more importance than at present; 
they claim to have been formerly Jadii RAjputs, and that their ancestors Lakhan Pal and 
Sumitr Pal, who dwelt at Tahangirh in Bhartpur, were converted to Islim in the reign of 
Firoz Shah (A, D. 1351 to 1388">, who gave Lakh.in P4l the name of Nihir Shin and 
Sumitr Pdl the name of Bahddur Kh4n, and in recognition of their high descent called

them Kh4nz4das and made them bear rule Id Mew4t. At first they are said to have lived 
at Sarahta near Tij4ra, and afterwards, according to tradition, they possessed 1,484 
villages. However ttis may be, there is no doubt that they were the rnling race in 
Mewat down to the time of Babar ; since then they have gradually declined in importance, 
and uow in this district own only a few villages near Xuh and to the north of Firozpur. 
'J'races of their former importance exist at Sohun, Bundsi, and Kotila, Kotila was one 
of their chief fortresses ; the village is situated in a small valley, wholly surrounded hj 
the hill, except where a small funnel-like pass gives entrance to it. In front of this pass 
is the JKotila jhil, and when this is filled with water the only road to the pass lies along 
a narrow strip of land between the lake and the hill. The remains of a breastwork along 
the face of the hill and across the mouth of the pass still exist, while on the hill above 
the village is a small ruined fort. The village now belongs to Meos. Some of the build- 
ings bear witness to its former greater importance, I have a suspicion that they are 
more intimately connected than they acknowledge with the Meos, whom they seem to me 
to resemble in personal appearance. They do not oidinarily intermarry with Meos, but 
the Meo inhabitants of five villages in the Firozpnr tahsil profess to have been formerly 
Khiuzadas, and to have become Meos by intermarriage. Their traditions also, which 
point to Sarahta as their ancient hon:e, agl'ee, I think it will be found, with those of more 
than one clan of Meos. If my supposition that the Meos are converted Miuas is correct, 
I am inclined to suspect that the Khanzadas are the representatives of the noble class 
among the Aboriginal population. Tod mentions an Asil of unmixed class among the 
Minas, known as Mainas." ' 

Tlie Khanzddas of Gurgaon call themselves J^dubansi by clan, and 
they commonly say that this is their only groi. Khd,nz^da, or "the 
son of a Khan," i^ precisely the Musalmaa equivalent to the Hindu 
Rdjput or "son of a RAja" ; and there can be little doubt that the 
Khdnz^das are to the Meos what the Rdjputs are to the Jdts. 

Khak, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Malt5,n. It traces its origin to 
the Kharrala of Montgomery and Lahore, accounting for its truncated 
name by a tale that once a party of Kharrals from the Lahore Bar 
encamped near a field of sugarcane in Multan and cut the cane to 
feed their cattle and make huts of it. When the owner of the field 
complained they declared that they thought the cane was a kind of reed. 
So they were dubbed khar, 'ass' in Persian. 

Khara, a Jat tribe, fouad it N^bha. It claims Chbatriya descent, and 
sajs its ancestor hela office at the Delhi court, but his son Khdra 
became a robber and went to Khandur where he married a woman of 
another tribe and so became a Jdt. The Kharas believe in a sidh 
whose shrine is at Khandur and there they offer fanjeri, etc. They 
do not use milk or curd until it has been offered at the shrine. On the 
5th of the second half of Baisd,kh, Maghar and Jeth special offerings 
are made there. The tidh was a Khara who used to fall asleep while 
grazing his cattle. One day his head was cut off by robbers, but he pur- 
sued them for some yards and the spot where he fell is no«v his shrine, 
and though the Khfiras have left Khandur the sidh is still worshipped.

in the latter district it is Hindu as well as Muhammadan.

at Bard,gaon, a Muliammadan village of Patid^la. When he went to pay 
the revenue into the treasury he got himself recorded as its owner and 
in their resentment the people murdered him. His wife on her way to 
her father's house, gave birth to a son, on a hard piece of ground, 
whence the name Kharauda or Kharora. 

KHAiiOTi, a Pathd,n tribe occupying the hills near the sources of the Gumal 
and the Histrict of Warghun or Arghun to the west of the Sulim^ukhel 
country and south by east of Ghazni. 'J'liey generally arrive in the 
plains towards the end of November and depart in May. Their A;iVr/s or 
encampments during the Avinter are located near Tank, Mulazai and 
Paharpur. They are a poor tribe, and have been nearly ruined by a long 
and unequal contest .with the Sulimankhels. This feud, though allowed 
to rest duj'ing their stay iu Hindustan, breaks out afresh as soon as they 
re-enter the hills ; though attempts have latterly been made by the 
Deputy Commissioner with some success to bring the two tribes to terms. 
Most of the Kharotis engage as labourers and carriers like the Nasirs. 
A large proportion of them are charra folk. Some are merchants, and 
trade in dried fruit and madder. 

Che Kharoti were identified by Bellew with the Arachoti of Alexan- 
der's historians, but though they dwell in the ancient Arachosia, it is 
difficult to accept that theory. They claim descent from Tdkhi, mother 
of Hotak, grandson of Ghilzai, but the Tokhi themselves say they are 
descended from a foundling adopted by their tribe. Bellew was pro- 
bably right in saying that they and the Nasirs ai-e of different origin to 
the mass of the Ghilzai. 

Khabral. — The Kharrals would appear to be a true Rajput tribe, though a 
very considerable portion of them are styled Jat. The Rajput Kharrals 
of Bahawalpur return their main tribe- as Bhatti. The few Kharrals in 
Jullundur are there recognised as Rdjpuls and those of Montgomery 
claim descent from Riija Karan. The Kharrals are found in large 
nun;bers only along the valley of the Rd,vi, from its junction with the 
Chenab to the boundary between Lahore and Montgomery ; while a 
few have spread up the Deg river into the Lahore and Gujrdnwd-la bar, 
and smaller numbers are found all along" the Sutlej valley as high up 
as Ferozepnr. The tribes of this portion of the Rd,vi, are divided into 
two classes, the Great Ravi tribes and the Nikki or Little Rd,vi tribes. 
Among the former tribes the Kharrals arc the most northerly and one of 
the most important. They are themselves divided into two factions, the 
upper Ravi and lower Ravi, the head-quarters of the latter being at 
Kot Kamalia. The two are at bitter feud, and the only tie between them 
is their hatred of their common enemy, the Sial Rajputs of Jliang. The 
Kamdlia Kharrals rose to some prominence in the time of Alamgir, and 
still hold remains of grants then made them, but the upper Kharrals are 
now the more powerful branch of the two. The Kharrals have ever been 
notorious for turbulence, and Mr. Purser's Montgomery Settlement Report 
contains details of their doings before and under Sikh rule, while the 



4d6 ' The Kharrats. 

hisfcory of the family is narrated in full at pages 509/?" of Griffin's Panjab 
Chiefs. They trace their origin from one Bhupa, a descendant of 
Rd,ja Karan, who settled at Uch and was there converted by Makhdum 
Shah Jahd-nidn. From Uch they moved up to their present territory. 
There are now very few in the Multan district; but the fact of their 
being found along the Sutlej, though in small numbers only, lends some 
support to the story of their iiaving come upwards from below. Captain 
Blphinstone thus described the Kharrals in his Gugaira Settlement 
Report : — 

" The ' Kharrals ' are the most northerly of the ' Great R4vi ' tribes. They occupy a 
great portion of the land between Gagaira and the Lahore district, on both sides of the 
river, and extend some distance into the Gujranwala district. In turbulence and courage 
they have been always considered to excel all the others except the Kathias ; but the 
tract occupied by them has been gradually denuded by the rapid extension of cultivation, 
of what formerly constituted their greatest strength, — heavy jungle. In case of disturb- 
ances, therefore, they have had at more recent periods to evacuate their own lands on 
the approach of large military forces, thus sustaining much damage by the destruction of 
their villages. Their most celebrated leader, Ahmad Khan, who was killed in September 
1857 by a detachment under Captain Black, beaded the combined tribes, however, in no 
less than five insnrrections, which to a certain extent &11 proved successful, their chief 
object — the plunder of the Khatris and Hindus — having usually been accomplished at the 
expense of a moderate fine imposed on them under the name of nasardna, after the con- 
clusion of peace. This success had spread his renown far and wide, and had given him 
a great influence over the whole of the ' Great Bavi,' as was proved by the outbreak of 
1857, which appears to have been mainly planned and organized by him. In stature the 
Kharrals are generally above the average height, their features are very marked, and 
their activity and endurance are remarkable. Like all the other Jats they pretend to a 
descent from the Rajputs, and like that class look down with some contempt upon men 
who handle the plough. The cultivation in their villages is, therefore, almost exclusively 
left to the Wasiwans and inferior castes, the Kharral proprietors contenting themselves 
with realizing their share of the produce. They only possess land in tracts inundated by 
the rivers, mere well-cultivation being too laborious a task even for their dependants." 

Mr. Purser adds that they are wasteful in marriage expenditurOi 
hospitable to travellers, thievish, and with little taste for agriculture ; 
and that they still follow many Hindu custorjs, especially on the occa- 
sion of marriage. In Lahore they appear to bear a no belter character 
than in Montgomery ; and there is a Persian proverb : " The Dogar, 
the Bhatti, the Wattu, and the Kharral are all rebellious and ought to 
be slain. '^ Sir Lepel Griffin wrote of them: "Through all historic 
times the Kharrals have been a turbident, savage, and thievish tribe, 
ever impatient of control, and delighting in strife and plunder. More 
fanatic than other Muhammadan tribes, they submitted with the greatest 
reluctance to Hindu rule ; and it was as much as Diwdn Sd,waii Mai and 
the Sikhs could do to restrain them ; for whenever an organised force 
was sent against them they retired into the marshes and thick jungles, 
where it was almost impossible to follow them." In Gujr^nwd,la they 
are said to be 'Mdle, troublesome, bad cultivators and notorious thieves, 
their persons generally tall and handsome, and their habits nomad and 
praedatory." 

From notes collected by Mr. E. D. Maclagan in Jhang it appears 
that the Kharrals in that District claim to be Punw^rs* and connected 
with Kaja Jagdeo, not Karn. They say they have been on the Ravi 
from time immemorial. They practise kareica (which accounts for their

498 Kharral clan. 

Butta or Butti Sultan was a Kharral chief in the time of Muhammad 
of Ghor, and was converted to IsIiIdi by Pir Slier fehah Sayyid Jaldl. 
The following ballad about him was given by a mirasi of the tribe : —

Aise unchhe Butte Rd sdi,

Smnundri sota juldhin,

the arm : 
We are weak, Butta Sultan ; 
We have this moment come. 



The same mirasi gave the following chajp : —

Kharral l-d hukm Ldhaur te. The Kharrals rule as far as Lahore.

The Kharrals of the Sandal Bd;r are the most satisfactory of all the 
nomad tribes in the Chendb Colony, now included in the Lyallpur dis- 
trict. Usually above the average height j.nd good looking, with marked 
features; they are at least the equals of the Sid,ls in strength and ac- 
tivity, and the latter decline to give them an opportunity of measuring 
strength at two ends of a rope. Some of their leaders are remarkably 
energetic and intelligent. Once largely addicted io female infanticide, 
the Kharrals have quite given up that practice and in the Colony now 
number as many females as males. Like other nomads of the Bdr the 
Kharrals are averse to sleeping under a heavy roof and prefer a small 
thatched cottage. They have a tradition that the Prophet Sulaim^n 
forbade them to sleep in roofed houses under penalty of the extinction 
of the family and their proverb ran : 

Kharral di paMii, na ghun na mahhi, 

' A Kharral is free from troubles, for he lives in a thatched hut/ 

The Kharrals have several clanp. The Lakhera, which has its head- 
quarters at Kot Kamdlia, an ancient town refounded by Kam^l Khd,n, 
its chief in the 14th century, was never numerically strong as a clan 
but it attained some importance under SaMaty^r Khdn of Kamd,lia who 
obtained a, jagir in the reign of Alamgir. The Lakhera were, however, 
at feud with the Upera Kharrals of the upper Havi and succumbed to 
the Sidls even in Saddaty^r Khan's lifetime. They regained their in- 
dependence, but onlv to bo conquered by the Nikkdi Sikhs and had in 
recent times largely lost all control over the Bdr, only a few Baloch 
tribes, with their old adherents, the Kathidas, Baghelas and Wahniw61s, 
standing by them. Most of the Kharrals in the Colony belong to the 
Upera clan. 

Two clans, often called Chuhrera Kharrals, class themselves as 
Kharrals, but they do not really belong to the tribe. These are the 
Piroke and -Idldlke and they are called Cbuhrora, because the famous 
Chuhra dacoit Sdndal, who gave hig uaine to the Sdndal Bar,t refused to

allow the KLarrals to graze in it^ unless they provided him with a 
bride. To this degradation the Kharrals at last assented, and when he 
went to fetch his wife Sandal was received with great Donip, but he 
and his companions were treacherously blown up with gun-powder con* 
cealed under the grass on which the feast was spread. The Kharrals 
then took the Chuhra women to wife. Their descendants are the 
Chuhrera Kharrals and their appearance is said to give colour to the 
tradition. 

The Kharrals in Bahawalpur have 15 septs : — Jag-sin, Salar-sin, 
Gugera, Taghera, Mamkhera, Chuharera, Sahi, Bhandara, Ran-sin, 
Jagwera, Fatwera, Jaswera, Darwesha, and Chahlak, andGaddan, and 4 
small mulims or sub-septs Kakla, Jameka, Paropi^, and Miana. 

There are two famous rehgious families of Kharrals (i) the Sahib» 
Z'^dagdn-i-Maharwi and Mangherwi, the descendants of Khwaja Nur 
Muhammad, the Qibla-i-Alim, and (ii) the Mians of the Sahib-us-Sair 
shrine. Both own vast areas, and Midu Fazl Haq, Mangherwi, pays 
R.s. 10,000 a year in land revenue.

Hill States of Kotkbai, Balsan, Jubbal, Bashahr, etc. It comprises a 
number of hhels, such as the Khashta in Kanaur. The Khash takes 
Kuran girls in marriage, but does not give them to Kur^ns. The 
Khash is also styled Katal, q. v. In Bashahr the Khash Kanets who

of the Indus. The Khasor belong to the Mati division of the Pathans 
and claim descent from Ibrahim the Lodi, son of Bibi Mato, daughter 
of Shaikh Bait. Ibrahim\s son Siilnai had tAvo sons, Prangi and Ismd,il 
and the former had nine sons, one of whom was named Khasyur, the 
ancestor of the Khassurs. Ibbetson dates their settlement in the hills 
of the Khassur Afghans early io the 13th century, but it was probably 
somewhat later.

III, but after the death of Bahdwal Khan IV their influence declined 
and now they have not access to the Darbar. 



500 Khdti—Khaiih. 

Khati,* an occupational term used in the north of Sirsa and the Phulki^n 
States for the carpenter and blacksmith (Lohar) and generally in the 
eastern plains for the carpenter, except on the Jumna where the term 
used is Bdrhi. Thus in Hiss^r Kdthi includes the Hindu carpenter 
of the south-eastern Punjab and the Suth^e or carpenter of the 
Bdrgar, who is a distinct tribe from the former. The Suthar too 
affects a certain superiority over the Khati, as he has taken to 
agriculture to a considerable extent while the Khd.ti has not ; and he 
does not intermarry with him. Many Khdtis are by sect Bishnoi, 
but they do nob intermarry with other Bishnoi castes such as the 
Bishnoi Jats. See under Tarkhan. 

KHATiks.t — The Khatiks are only found in any numbers in the Jumna 
zone, in Sirsa, in Pati^la, and the other Phulkidu States. They are 
'par excellence tanners and dyers of goats' skins, and claim to be 
of Hindu status because they do not eat dead animals though they 
use flesh and liquor. Brahma, they say, assigned to them a goat's 
skin, the bark of trees and lac — so they graze cattle, dye the skins of 
goats and deer, and tan hides with bark and lac. Their priests are 
Gaur Brahmans who officiate in the phera rite at weddings and in the 
hiria at funerals, although the Khatiks are menials, and only Chuhras 
and Chamara will drink water at their bunds. In the Bawal nizdmat 
of Nabha the Bdgri|. group is found which claims Khatri descent, and 
has four gots, the Jatoria named from the place whence it migrated, 
and the Bairiwal, Aswdl and Kenchi which three latter are numeri- 
cally large. Khatiks only avoid one got in marriage and allow widow 
remarriage. Their women wear no nose-ring. The tribe worships 
Bhairon and Sidh- Masani, also known as Mdt4 Masaui. At Hdjipur in 
Alwar, where there is a shrine of the goddess Durga, they perform 
children's first tonsure and the bride and bridegroom are also taken to 
worship at the shrine. The gurus of the Hindu Khatiks are Nanak- 
panthi Sikhs, yet they observe none of the Sikh tenets. In the Phul 
and Amloh nizdmats of Nabha are found two classes of Muhammadan 
Khatiks — the Rd^jput and Ghori Pathan groups, each of which is as a 
rule endogamous. 

The Khatiks are sometimes confused with the Ghamrang, but the 
latter tans baffalo and ox hides with hme, and does not dye leather, so 
that he ranks below the Khatik who tans and dyes only sheep and 
goat skins, using salt and the juice of the maddr {Calotropis procera), 
but no lime. On the other hand, the Khatik is certainly below the 
Chamar because he will keep pigs and poultry, which a Chamar would 
not do ; and be will even act as a butcher, it is said, though this appears 
unlikely as he is of so low a status. He is however possibly a 

* Kbati is defined by Platts {Hindustani Dicty., p. 867) to be a caste of Hindos who 
are generally employed as cartwrights, a carpenter. Kdth is wood or timber in Hindi 
and in Multani tu(/u or lidth. The derivation of Khati is obscure. 

t The Khatik is a caste of Hindustan and the name is defined by Platts (Hiiidtistdni 
Dicty., p. 872) to mean a hunter, a low caste which keeps pigs and poultry, a tanner,

■pirr-keeper of the eastern Punjab is a Purbia iaimigraut, while the Muhannnadau Khatik 
of the west is a Chamar who has taken to tanuiug. But in Nabha at any rate the Hindu

pork-butcher. He is also said to keep sheep and goats and twist their 
hair into waist bands for sale. The Khatik appears to be by origin 
a scavenger who is rising in tlie social scale by taking to dyeing and 
tanning, but has not yet attained to the status of a worker in leather. 
He is closely akin to the Pa',si and may even be a sub-group of that

Dicty,, s. V. Satrap. 

Literature assigns various origins to the Khatri caste. According 
to the Vishnu Parana, Bharata, the king whose name so constantly 
crops up in various forms in the Punjab, had nine sons, whose mothers 
put them to death, fearful that he would disown them as they bore no 
resemblance to him. Thus left sonless, Bharata sacrificed to the 
Maruts and they gave him Bharadwaja, son of Brihaspati by Mamatd,. 
Bharadwdja had four grandsons, of whom two became Brahmans while 
two remained Khatris, though all continued to be of the Bhd,radwaja 
gotra. 

The Angiras-gotri Khatris are described as descended from Agni, 
Havishmat cr Havirbhuja, as he also called, though the Havishmats 
or Havismats are also said to be descendants of Angii-as and the 
great progenitors of the Kshatriya s. 

The Kausika-gotri Khatris are of Lunar descent, through Kusa, the 
king who was 11th in descent from Soma and 9tli from King Pururavas. 
But one of Kusa's four sons had a descendant Vishvamitra whose family 
became Brahmans. To this gotra belongs the Khanna got of the modern 
Khatris. 

The Kausilya or Kausalya-gotri Khatris are of Solar race, King 
Kausalya or Hiranyaniibha Kausilya their eponym, being 22nd iu de- 
scent from Raghu. 

To this gotra belong the Mihii'a Khatris, the Kapura got being by 
gotra Kautsika. 

Time was when Brahmans intermarried with Khatris on equal terms, 
but this has long sifice ceased to be allowed. The Sarsut or Saraswat 
Brahmans, who are the parokits of the Kliatris,* will, however, eat any 
food prepared by a Khatri, a privilege said to be denied to a Rajput. 
And the true Saraswat will accept gifts from Khatris alone, in accord- 
ance with the ancient rule that a Brahman shall only accept gifts from 
the warrior class. 

* For instance the Jetli Sarsut, wlio are descendants of Jetal, a son of Vasishta muni 
priest to Ram Chandra, are 'i>uruhits of the Mihira or Mahra Khatris to this day. 



502 The term Kshatriya. 

Rationally iuterpreted these historical legends say clearly enough 
that the Khatri caste is made up of at least three probably racial ele- 
ments, Solar, Lunar and the Agni-kula or Fire-race. Of those races 
some families became Brahmans and others remained Kshatriyas. 
Others, according to the Mahiibharata, became Vaisyas, Sudras or even 
barbers. 

The meaning of the word Kshatriya is usually said to be warrior, or at 
least the Kshatriya* is described as the warrior class. But Fick has an 
instructive passage on this point and says: ' Kshatriya corresponds to 
the Vedic rajanya and is applied to the successors of the conquering 
families under whose leadership the Aryan stocks had secured their 
new settlements in the Gangetic lands, and, also, to the overlords of 
tlie indigenous peoples who had been able to maintain their independence 
in the war against the foreign invaders. The Kshatriyas then were not 
by any means of one and the same race. They represented the political 
power and embodied the idea of a community which stood above the 
family, above the caste, the idea of the State. We have uo right to 
speak of a Kshatriya ' caste ' ill the modern sense of that term. The 
Kshatriyas formed a ruling class and were not necessarily warriors, any 
more than the army was necessarily recruited only from Kshatriyas. ' 

As the name of a ruling race, or as the title of several ruling fami- 
lies, the term Kshatriya is of great antiquity. This is not however a 
place for a discussion of the problems connected with the Kshatriyas' 
place in history. " The three great Kshatriya lines," writes Mr. 
Pargiter, " the Solar and Lunar and Yadava dynasties, profess to exhibit 
more than oO well-remembered generatioiis."t The following table of 
descent is compiled from his article : —

which reigned in Ahichchhatra, and the South Panchdla. Omitting the

dynasties which had no connection with tho Punjab, we learn that the 
descendants of Yay^ti's son Ann branched oui in tho north-west into 
the Punjab tribes of tlie Kekayas, Shivis, etc. Shivi, son of Ushinara 
of this line had four song who orij^inated the Vrishadarbhas, Suviras, 
Kekayas or Kaikayas and Madras of the Punjab. 

The earliest and greatest Vishvdmitra was the son of Gd-dhi or Gd,- 
thin, king of Kanyakubja, and his Kshatriya name was Vishvaratha. 
Gddhi's daughter Satyavali was married to the risM Richika Bhdrgava 
and had a son Jamadagni, whose youngest son was Rama. 

Kritavirya, king of the Haihayas, had the Bhdrgavas* as his priests 
and endowed them with preat wealth. During the reign of his son 
Arjuna, who reigned at Mandhata on the Narrnada river, the Haihayas 
endeavoured to recover this wealth from the Bhdrgavas and, failing to 
do so, killed or dispersed them. 'I'liis brought them into conOict with 
Rdma, as Arjuna or his sons had robbed Jamadagui, Uie Bhd-rgava, so 
Rilma killed Arjuna, and in revenge the latter's sons murdered Jama- 
dagni. Rdma swore vengeance on the Kshatriy as, destroyed all Arjuna's 
sons, save 6ve, and thousands of Haihayas ; and moreover he extended 
his hostility to all Kshatriyas and exterminated them, according to the 
legend, 21 times. But in spite of this ^extermination' the Haihayas 
and Td,lajanglias soon after overran the whole of North India, which 
was simultaneously invaded by foreign hoides from the north-west. 

The curious story which connects Rama and his brother Shatrughna 
•with the Yd/davas, explains some important territorial facts. Madhu, 
called king of the D6navas,t was a Yadava and his realm extended 
from Guzerat to the Madhu-vana or forest on the Junma. Fourth ia 
descent from him reigned Sattvata whose son Bhima was contemporary 
with Rd,ma. Shatrughna killed Lavana, J the local ruler, felled the forest 
and founded Mathura, but after Rd,ma^s death Bhima recovered the 
city and his son Andhaka reigned there, but Mathura continued to be 
also called iShurasena, after Shatrughna's son who had held charge of it. 
Kans, a descendant of Andhka, reigned there however in the Pdndavas' 
time. Samvarana, the Bhdrata, was driven out of his kingdom by the 
Panchdlas and sought refuge in a fortress on the Sindhu for many 
years, ui'til a Vasishtha became his priest and encouraged him to 
recover his realm. Samvarana's expulsion from it must have been 
effected by Sudds, who defeated the kings on the Parushni (Rdvi), 
after subduing the Lunar kingdom of the Bharatas. His conquests 
stirred up against him the tribes to the west, such as the Yddavas, 
of Mathura, the Shivas, or Shivis, descendants of Anu, the Druhyus, 
or Gd,ndhd,ras, apparently a tribe which gave its name to Gandhdra (the 
Peshd^war valley), the Matsyas§ (to the west of Mathura), the 
Turvasha, probably on the north-west of Sudas' kingdom. Samvarana's 
dispossession lasted over Sahadeva's reign into Somaka's, and the story 
o-oes that he sacrificed his first-born son Jantu in order to obtain others.

504 Kshatriya functions. 

This barbarous piece of magic apparently drove Vasishtha to espouse 
Samvarana's cause, the more so in that his own sons had been put to 
death by Sudas' descendants. After Samvai-ana came Kuru, who gave 
his name to the Kurukshetr. His descendants, the Kauravas, fought 
the great fii?ht with the Pd,ndavas and with that event nearly all the 
genealogical lists of the Kshatrijas end, as if an era of considerable 
pi'osperity and refinement had abruptly ceased. Whatever the 
historical facts may have been there is hardly a name in the semi- 
mythical legends of the modern Punjab which does not appear in the 
Kshatriya chronicles. 

Quite apart from the resemblance of the names Kshatriya and 
Khatri the position of the Kshatriya in ancient times finds very close 
parallels in his relations to the modern Hindu castes in the Punjab. 
The ancient Kshatriya literature was imbued with the historical 
spirit. The Kshatriyas played a very great part in the early days of 
Indian history and a consideration of the literature originated by 
them is essential to a right understanding of those times. We have 
the results of their literary aptitude in the Epics and Puranas, 
overlaid though they be with Brahminioal accretions. The general 
trend of the ancient Kshatriya teachinor was monotheistic and ethical. 
It was not anti-Brahminical but anti-Biahmanist, and opposed to the 
orthodox Brahmaism of the older Upanishads, which was mainly 
taught by the Brahmans of the Madhyadesa. The Sdnkhva-Yoga 
and Bhagavata systems are both in their origins connected with a 
number of Kshatriya names. 

It is hardly necessary to point how modern Sikhism reproduces 
in a most striking Avay all that is distinctive in the relations of the 
ancient Kshatriya to the masses of the Hindu peoples of Northern 
India. The position of the Be»li, the Sodhi and other quasi-sacred 
sections of the Khattris, as the teachers and leaders of the J^ts and 
other tribes, is essentially that which they occupied in the time of the 
Mahd,bharata, and it wonld be of great interest to investigate whether 
the modern Khatri teaching is based on any literary or traditional 
descent from the old Kshatriya literature. 

Though all the names preserved in the Epics and Purdnas belong to 
pre-history, many generations after the war of the Mahd,bhdrata elapsed 
before the Kshatriya 4ynasties ended. Thus the Solar line terminates 
with Rdjd, Sumitra, 30th in descent from Brihadhal, who was killed by 
Arjuu's son Abhimanyu ; and the Lunar ends with Kshemak, 25th in 
descent from Arjun's grandson. 

The well-known legend tells how Parasu Rama, the Brahman and the sixth incarnation 
of Vishnu exterminated the Kshatriyas in 21 attacks, and not content with slaughtering the 
men he destroyed even the infants in the womb. So the Kshatriya women fled to the 

* Dr. G A. Grierson holds that there was in ancient India a long struggle for supremacy 
between the Brahmans and the Kshatriyas; that the K urukshetra or Madhyadesa was the 
centre of Brahmaism, all the surrounding countries being unorthodox, their unorthodoxy 
being fostered by learned Kshatriyas. Some of these kshatriyas found an asylum in the 
tracts to the enst and south of the IMadhyadesa, among the Panchalas who permitted poly- 
andry like the modern J4ts ; and that the f',ns et origo of the Mahabharata war was the insult 
offered by Drupada, the Kshatriya king of the Panchalas, to a Brahraana who sought a refuge 
with the Kurus, so that in its essence the war of the Mahabharata was a cult war between 
the Brahmaist Kurus and the Kshatriya-guided Panchalas. J. R. A. S., 1908^ pp. 843.4., 



The Punjah Kshatriyas. 505 

Sarsut Brahraans of Kurukshetr on the Saraswati and when Parasu Rama demanded their 
surrender the Brahmans declared them their own daughters. Parasu Rama in his wrath 
bade them eat ]:acha hhojan (unlawful food) from their hands as a test of the relationship 
and only when they did so did he spare the women. So their children were called Khatris 
instead of Chhatris.* 

The clironology of i\\& Kshatriyas is still largely a matter of conjec- 
ture^ and it is not until the period of tlieir decadence sets in that actual 
history begins. " In tho Piiranic lists the earliest dynasty which can 
claim historical reality," writes Mr. Vincent Smith, "is that known as 
the Saisunaga, from the name of its founder ' Sisuud,ga ' — or Sheshndg." 
And the first of this dynasty of whom anything substantial is known 
is Bimbisara, or Srenika, the fifth of his line. He ruled circa B.C. 519. 
This dynasty was certainly of foreign origin and during its ascendancy 
much of the Western Punjab formed the Persian satrapies of India and 
Gandaria. Mahanandin, the last of the Saisundga dynasty, had a son 
by a Sudra woman and he usurped the throne, establishing the Nanda 
dynasty which wagged wars of extermination against the Kshatriyas. 
The last of the Nine Nandas was in turn deposed by Chandragupta 
Manrya (321 B. C), who found his opportunity in the troubles conse- 
quent on Alexander's death in 823 B. C. and became master of north- 
western India before he seized the throne of Magadha. 

But to retrace our footsteps still further back for a moment, it may 
be of interest to see whether the Kshatriyas were still existent in the 
Punjab at the time of the Macedonian invasion. 

It is difficult to accept the identification of the Xafchroi of Alexander's 
historians with the Kshatriya, though McCriadie appears to favour it. 
The Xatliroi lay between the Indus and the lower course of the Chenab 
(Akesines). Elsewhere McCrindle identifies the Xathroi with the 
Kshiitri,t a low caste quite distinct from the Kshatriya, [Ancient India, 
its Invasion hy Alexander, pp. 847 and 156). It is tempting to identify 
Poras with Paurava, but he is nowhere described as a Xathros or a 
satrai:)vs, as he would have been if he had been a Kshatriya. M. Sylvain 
Levi identifies Phegeus or Phegelas whose territory lay between the 
Ravi and the Beas,wit.h BhagalaJ — the name of a royal race of Kshatriyas 
which the Gana-patha classes under the rubric Biihu, etc., with the 
name even of Taxilas, Omphis, (Sanskr. Ambhi) : Ihid. p. 401. 

After the Christian era we find the rulers of Brdhmaur, now the 
Ohamba State, bearing the Kshatriya affix Varma for a long period, 
froin A. D. 620 to about the end of the 16tli century. § 

From the debris of the Kshatriya dynasties sprang the Rujpnt fami- 
lies, but the exact process of the transformation is obscure. Tradition 
has it that the rishis created the four Agnikul Kshatriyas, the Prahar, 
Sulankhi, Panwara and Chauhiln (names unknown to the earlier Ksha- 
triya history) to fight against the infidels. From these Agnikuls sprang 
the 36 Rajput Chhatris or Kajput houses of Kajputana. But these 
are Tod held, doubtless rightly, not pure Kshatriyas, but descend-

ants (at least in some cases) of converted Buddhists, Huns and Tak- 
shaks, affiliated to the purer Kshatriya families. It is quite certain 
that the Rd,jputs are a far later development than the Kshatriyas. 

The Khatri occupies a very different position among the people of 
the Punjab from that of the other mercantile castes. Superior to them 
in physique, in manliness, and in energy, he is not, like tliem, a mere 
shop-keeper, but a direct representative of the Kshatriya of Manu. 
The following extract from Sir George Campbell's Ethnology of India 
admirably describes the position of the Khatri : — 

'* Trade is their main oooupatioii ; but in fact they have broader and more distinguish- 
ing features. Besides monopolising the trade of the Punjab and the greater part of 
Afghanistan, and doing a good deal beyond those limits, they are in the Panjab the chief 
civil administrators, and have almost all literate work in their hands. So far as the Sikhs 
have a priesthood, they are, moreover, the priests or gnrus of the Sikhs. Both Nanak and 
Govind were, and the Sodis and Bed is of the present day are, Khatria. Thus then they 
are in fact in the Punjab, so far as a more energetic race will permit them, all that 
Mahratta Brahmins are in the Mahratta country, besides engrossing bhe trade which the 
Mahratta Brahmins have not. They are not usually military in their character, but are 
quite capable of using the sword when necessary. Diwan Sawan Mai, governor of Multan, 
and his notorious successor Mnlraj, and very many of Ranjit Singh's chief functionaries, 
were Khatris. Even under Muhammadau rulers in the weat, thfy have risen to high 
administrative posts. There is a record of a Khatri Diwan of Badakshan or Kunduz; and 
I believe, of a Khatri governor of Pesha'w^nr under the Afghans. The emperor Akbar's 
famous minister, Todur Mai, was a Khatri; and a relative of that man of undoubted 
energy, the great Commissariat contractor of Agra, Joti Parshad, lately informed me that 
he also is a Khatri, Altogether there can be no doubt that these Khatris are one of the 
most acute, energetic, and remarkable races in India, though in fact, except loca.lly in the 
Punjab, they are not much kno'vn to Europeans. The Khatria are staunch Hindus; and, 
it is somewhat singular that, while giving a religion and priests to the Sikhs, they them- 
selves are comparatively seldom Sikha. The Khatris are a very fine, fair, handsome race. 
And, as may be gathered from what I have already said, they are very generally educated. 

" There is a large subordinate cliss of Khatris, somewhat lower, but of equal mercantile 
energy, called Rors, or Roras. The proper Khatris of higher grade will often deny all 
connexion with them, or at least only admit that they have some sort of bastard kindred 
with Khatris ; bat I think there can be no doubt that they are ethnologically the same, 
and they are certainly mixed up with Khatris in their avocations. I shall treat the whole 
kindred as generically Khatris. 

" Speaking of the Khatris then thug broadly, they have, as I have said, the whole trade 
of the Punjnb and of most of Afghanistan. No village can get on without the Khatri who 
keeps the accounts, does the banking business, and buys and sells the grain. They seem, 
too, to get on with the people better than most traders and usurers of this kind. In 
Afghanistan, among a rough and alien people, the Khatris are as a rule confined to the 
position of humble dealers, shop-keepers, and money-lenders ; but in that capacity the 
Pathans spem to look at them as a kind of valuable animal ; and a Pathan will steal 
another man's Khatri, not c>nly for the sake of ransom, as is frequently done on the 
Peshawar and Hazara frontier, but also as he might steal a milch-cow, or as Jews might, 
I dare say, be carried off in the Middle Ages with a view to render them profitable. 

"I do not know the exact limits of Khatri occupation to the west, but certainly in all 
Eastern Afghanistan they seem to be just as much a part of the established community as 
they are in the Punjab. They find their way far into Central Asia, but the further they 
get the more depressed and humiliating is their position. In Tnrkistan, Vambery speaks 
of them with grent contempt, as yellow-faced Hindus of a cowardly and sneaking charac- 
ter. Under Turcoman rale they could hardly be otherwise. They are the only Hindus 
known in Central Asia. In the Punjab they are so numerous that they cannot all be rich 
and mercantile; and many of them hold land, cidtivate, take service, and follow various 
avocations. 

" The Kliatris are altogether excluded from Brahmin Kashmir. In the hills however 
the Kakkas, on the east bank of the J helum, are said to have been originally Khatris 
(they are a curiously handsome race), and in the pterior of the Kangra hills there is an 
interesting race of fine patriarchal-looking shepherds called Gaddisj most of whom are 
Khatris. Khatri traders are numerous in Delhi ; are found in Agra, Lucknow, and 
Patna; and are well known in the Bara Bazar of Calcutta, though there they are princi- 
pally connected with Punjab firms, 



The Punjab Khatris. 507 

" The Khatris do not seem, as a rule, to reach the western coast: iu the Bombay 
market I cannot find that they have any considerable place. In Sindh, however, I find 
iu Captain Burton's book an account of a race of pretended Kshatriyas who are really 
Banias of the Nfinak Shahi (Sikh) faith, and who trade, and have a large share of public 
oflSces. These are evidently Khatris. Ludhiana is a largn and thriving town of mercant- 
ile Khatris." 

Within the Punjab the distribution of tlie Khatri element is very 
well marked. It hardly appears east of LiKthiana, the eastern boundary 
of the Sikh religion, nor does it penetrate into the eastern hills. It is 
strongest in the central districts where Sikhism is most prevalent, and 
in the Rawalpindi division and Haz^ra, and occupie.s a fairly important 
position in the western Hill States. Although the Khatris are said 
to trace their origin to Multan, tliey are far less prominent in the 
southern districts of the Western Plains, and least of all on the actual 
frontier ; but this would be explained if the Aroras be considered a 
branch of the Khatris. 

As Sir George Campbell remarkei^, it is curious that, intimately con- 
nected as the Khatris always have been nnd still are with the Sikh 
religion, only 9 per cent, of them should belong to it. Nor is it easy to 
see why the proportion of Sikhs should double and treble in the Jhelum 
and Rawalpindi districts. But the social gradations of the Khatris, 
based as they appear to be upon an immemorial tradition of former 
greatness, hinder their acceptance of the stricter democratic doctrines 
of the Sikh faith. A Khatri, when a Sikh, is ordinarily a Sikh of 
Nd,nak, rather than a devotee of Guru Govind, and he thus avoids the 
necessity of completely abnegating his caste principles. The same 
pride of birth has militated against the Rajput's acceptance of Sikh 
teaching. The Khatris are probably numerous in Jhelum and Rd,wal- 
pindi because the Rajput element in the north-west Punjab has always 
been weak. Some are Musalman, chiefly in Multd-n and Jbang Avhere 
they are commonly known as Khojas ; these are said to belong chiefly 
to the Kapur section. The rest are Hindus. 

The Khatris are essentially a trading caste, like the Aroras and 
Blid.tias, comparatively few being engaged in as:riculture, but they 
stand higher than either of those castes, many of them being bankers, 
and they are a'so largely employed in the civil administration. The 
distribution of these castes is illustrated by the maps, J, II, and 
IV facing pp. 3C3 and 308 in chapter Report of the Punjab Census 
1901. 

The Aroras hold the south-west, as the B^nias do the south-east, of 
the Punjab, tract.s in which the Khatris are hardly to be found. On 
the other hand, the Blid^ia is found side by side with the Khatri In 
Sid,lkot, Giijrat and Shd,hpur. The connection between these three 
castes is obscure, and indeed it is doubtful whether the Bhatia has any 
ethnological connection with the Khntri or Arora. The two castes 
indeed appear to overlap, for in Jhang the Magu and Katial sections 
who deem themselves Khatris, but are regarded as Aroras by the 
Lahoria Khatris, used it is said to give wives to the admitted Khatris 
of the northern Chenawan coun'^ry — on the upper reaches cf the 
Chenab — taking their wives from the Dakhanada Aroras further dowa 
the Indus valley. And in Bahawalpnr Khatris generally take Arora

Organization. 
The Khatris are divided into threB main groups^ viz. : — 

I — Bdri, II — Bunjdhi, and III — Sarin. — The Baris generally may 
take wives froiu the Bunjahis, but do not give them daughters in re- 
turn. If a B^ri family gives a daughter in marriage to a Bunjaui it 
loses status and becomes itself Banjahi. The exact position of the 
Sarin is obscure. It is implied in more than one account sent to me 
that they are hypergamous, giving daughters to the Bunjahis. In 
Patiala they use(i to intermarry with that group, but infrequently, 
as such alliances were not approved. In Peshawar the Sariu claim 
that the Bunjahis used to give theiu daughters, which is hardly possi- 
ble, for it is admitted on all hands that they are below the Buujabis in 
status^ and in Delhi they cannot even smoke with the two higher 
groups. Practically it may be said that they now form an endogamous 
sub-caste; but there, is one important exception, as will be noted 
infra. Each of these three groups is further divided into sub-groups, 
as described below : — ■ 

Group 1 — Bdri.— This group comprises 12 exogamous sections, 
and its name is undoubtedly derived from hdrah, ' 12.' 

These sections appear to rank thus : —

gheb Gandhoke Bah. Wahi and Soni are given instead of Nos. 9 and

The Bari group is apparently a close corporation into which no ncvv 
iections could be admitted, though a family of any of its 12 sections 
may be degraded to a lower group. It contains four sub-.^roups based 
on the status of the famihes (not of the sections) in eack Thus the

are below the Dhaigliar in status because they can give a daughter in 
marriage to four {char) sections ; and so on."^ 

It follows from this that the families in each section are not all of the 
same status. For instance the Kapur section is mostly of Dhaighar 
status, but certain families having given daughters to the Sahgal 
section have falleu to Baraghar stathis, i. e., to the status of tho^e who 
will give daughters to all twelve sections. Other families again have 
even fallen to Bunjahi status, by giving daughters in that group. 

Growp II— Bimjdhi.i— This group comprises, theoretically, 52 i-ections, 
as the name baivanjahi, from hauanja ' 52,' would imply. The names 
and numbers of the sections are however variously stated, and it is 
clear that, all told, the number of sections in this group greatly exceeds 
62. The sub-groups are variously given, but the typical grouping 
would seem to be as follows : — 

Suh-group i. — Khokhran. — This group consisted of 8 sections origin- 
ally, and hence it is also 
known as Ath-zatia or 
Ath-ghar, and these 
sections are, in Rawal- 
pindi, divided into four 
thamas as grouped in 
the margin. Of these 
the first three form exo- 
gamous divisions, in- 
termarriage being for- 
bidden between the two 
sections in each thama, 
because they belong to 
the same Brahmanical 
gotra. To these eight sections the Chandiok have been affiliated in 
I'eshawar, and in Patiala the Kannan section is said to belong to this 
group. 

The Khokharan were originally an offshoot of the Bunjahis, and I 
have therefore classed them ni this group, but, though they are said in 
one locality to still take wives from the other Bunjahis, they are as a 
rule endogamous and thus really form a sub-caste.

* This explanation is advanced tentatively : for a further discussion of the meaning of 
these terms see the Appendix to this Chapter. 

^ A Jhang account says that the Bunjahi consist of 9 sections only, viz. : — 

1 Ketil (? Katial). I 3 Mehmlru. I 5 Wasan. I 7 Chine. 

2 Magun. I 4 Dand-dhuna, | G Bhambri. | 8 Dhil. 

(The 9th is not tnovvn, nor can Us parohit be found.) These i) sections are called phali. 
At marriages the boy's father bathes and then ^i,ives 5 rupees per 2'''!«.'i to the iiarohits of 
the 1' sections. This ceremony is also called phaU. 

X The Bari-Bunjahi must not bu confused with the Bari group above, The Biri-Bunjahi 
are a sub-group of the Bunjahi. 



610 ' The Sarin Khatris. 

8ub-group Hi. — Bard or elder Bunjdhi, with 40 sections, called col- 
lectively Dharmdn or Dharmain. 

Sub-group iv. — Chhota or younger Bunjdhi, with over 100 sections. 
This sub-group is also called Ansar, or Sair, or Bunjahi-khurd or-^ dm. 

Of the last three sub-groups the third used to give daughters to the 
second. The relations of the fourth, the Chhota Bunjahi, to the second 
and third are not explicitly stated, but they also appear to be hyper- 
gamous. 

The conjecture may be hazarded that the peculiar Khatri organiza- 
tion reflects in some way not at present traceable the old Kshatriya 
division into Lunar and Solar families or dynasties. The division into 
the Bara and Biitiidld groups is noticed in the Ain-i- Ahhari* : — 

" The Kshatriya (now called Khatris) form two races, the Surajbansi and Som- 
bansi. * * There are more than 500 tribes of these Kshatriyas, of whom 

52 (Bawanjai) are pre-eminently distinguished and 12 (Baraghar) are of considerable im- 
portance. * * Some of their descendants, abandoning the profession of 
arms, have taken to other occupations, and this class is known to the world by this name." 

The Sarin would thus appear to be of later origin than Akbar's 
time. 

Group III. — Sarin. — This group comprises a large number of sections, 
and the story goes that in 1216 A. D., the group was divided into 20 
grades, each consisting of 6 sections, though, as a matter of fact, 123 
sections are specified. At present there are two sub-groups :— 

Suh-group i. — Bara, or elder Sarin. 
Suh-group ii. — Chhota or junior Sarin. 

The first sub-group comprises, according to one account, 10 sections 
and according to another, J3,t but of these 13 the last two are unable 
to obtain wives from the other H sections, to which they give wives. 
The Chhota Sarin, comprising 108 sections, used to give daughters to 
the Bara sub-group, but the two sub-groups are now said not to inter- 
marry. Generally speaking, the Sarin sections are distinct from those 
of the Bunjahi and Bari groups, and it is unusual to find a section partly 
Bunjahi and partly Sarin. 

Territorial groups. — The territorial groups of the Khatris render it 
exceedingly difficult to give a clear account of their organization and 
for this reason any allusion to them was excluded in the preceding para- 
graph. They must, however, be described and as far as possible 
explained, for they are constantly mentioned in the received accounts 
of the caste and, what is more important, have a place in its organiza- 
tion. They are indeed cross-divisions of the groups already described. 

The most ancient territorial group appears to be the Uchhandi, or 
Khatris ' of the uplands,' which may be taken to mean ' of the north- 
west Punjab.' Other territorial groups are Multani, which was of 
high standing, Peshawaria, and Bharochi (of Bhera in Sliahpur). None 

* Blochmann's Trans., Ills p. 117. 

t It would almost seem that the Sarin attempted or are attempting to form a Bari 
sub-group, with Vi sections at the top in imitation of the Bari Bunjahi. 



Territorial groups. 6J 1 

of these seem to be endogamous. The Lalioria and Sirhiudia* in- 
termarry on equal terms, though the former possesses an exalted 
status, so that '' Dh^ighar (B^ri) Lalioria" denotes the fine fleur oi 
Khatri-ism. 

In the Sialkot sub-montane there are two endogamous groups, the 
Jhikli, ' of the plains,' and the Dugri, ' of the low hills,' and in both of 
these the B^ri and other social groups appear not to exist. 

In the south-east of the Punjab there are two groups, the Dilwdlat 
(of Delhi), and Agraw^la, to which may be added a third, the Purbia 
(in the United Provinces). In the Agrawala the B^ri group does not 
appear to exist but there are Dhaighar, Charghar, Chliezjiti and Kho- 
khar^n groups, and below them the Bunji:ihi and Sarin groups, as in 
the central districts of the Punjab. Of these the Sarin and Khokhar^n 
are strictly endogamous, but the others are hypergamous. The terri- 
torial groups here are distinctly hypergamous, for the Agrawdlas take 
wives from the Purbias and some Agrawala families take a pride in 
giving daughters to the Sirhindia and Lahoria groups; so too the 
Dilwalas used to give daughters to other groups, especially to the 
Agraw^las, though they are now said to be eudogamous. These terri^ 
torial groups however appear to be somewhat nebulous in character, 
for to the Khatris of the United Provinces all the Khatris of these 
Provinces are ' Punjabi,' and conversely to the Punjab Khatris those 
of the United Provinces are ' Purbia/ 



* Lahoria=' of Lahore,' and Sirhindia— 'of Sirhind,' i.e., of the country near Pafciala 
titc. The two groups have nearly the same sections and intermarry on equal terms but 
they have different ceremonies at marriages. They are said, in an account of the Khatris 
written by Rai Bahadur Piare Lai of Delhi, to be grouped thus : —

writer does not mention the B:-iris but that group is certainly found in Patiala and Lahore 
t Dilwila (Delhi- wala) comprises : — ' • ' 

1. Seth. I 3. Kapiir. I -5. Kakkar. 

2. Mehra. I 4. Tandan. | 6. Bohra. 
But the last saction cannot obtain wives from the first five. 

L. Piare Lil also notes that the Dilwala have ceased to smoke with the other divisions 
of the caste. 



Bl2 The sacred sections. 

The sacred sections of the Khatrts. — There are four sacred sections 
among the Khatris, whose position must be touched upon. These are 
the — 

Bedi,* of the Dharman-Bunjaki or Chhota-Sarin sub-group, 

Sodhi, of the Chhota Sarin sub-group. 

Tihun or Trihim j r ii, t> ■ o ' i, 
■pj^j^jj > of the Bara-Sarin sub-group. 

These four sections became sanctified by the births of the various 
Sikh Gurus to tliem. Thus the second Guru, Angad, was a Trihun, 
and, strictly speaking, his descendants are styled B4wa-Trihuns : the 
third Gnrii, Amr Das, was a BhalLi and his descendants are, similarly, 
Baw^-Bhallas : but in each case the isection, as a whole, appears to have 
acquired a sacred character by the birth of the Guru within it, and it 
is not merely his descendants who possess that character. Nevertheless 
it is to be noticed that this inherited sanctity has not altered the social 
status of these sections in the caste. Tha Sodhist remain Sarin, but 
they intermarry with the Bedis, whose status is generally said to be 
Bunjahi. Further the Bedi have actually in a few cases violated the 
rule of exogamy aiid permitted marriage within the got, it being ap- 
parently held a less evil to break that rule-than to give a daughter in 
marriage to any but a member of a sacred section. 

Rules of marriage. — Generally speaking, the Khatris avoid the usual 
four sections of gots, viz., those of the father, mother, father's mother 
and mother's mother : but when tlie lavv of hypergaray narrows the 
circle of alliances, this rule has to give way. Thus the Dhdighar 
families of the Kapur, Khanna, Malhofcra and Seth sections are not 
bound by this rule, and avoid only the father's got and the near rela- 
tions of the mother. Farther, the rule forbiddino* intermarriao-a be- 
tween the descendants of a common ancestor is not invariably observed, 
for the first three of these sections are descended from three brothers, 
yet their descendants are closely intermarried. The Khokharan again 
avoid only the gots of the father and mother, because they have so few 
sections to marry into. The B^iris appear to avoid both the parents' 
gots and the relations of their mothers within seven degrees, but no 
general rule can be laid down. 

A common Brahmanical gotra is also said to be, as a rule, a bar to 
intermarriage, but though ,the Khanna and Kapur sections are both 
of the Kaushal gotra, they intermarry. Thus we have the unexpected 
result that the higher groups are the least bound by the ordinary rules 
which prohibit marriage within certain circles of relationship. 

* The Nanakputra or 'children of Nanak' appear to have been Bedis. In later Sikh times 
they were employed as escorts to caravans whose safety was insured by their sacred descent. 
Nanakputra is however also said to be a synonym for Udasi. Prinsep gives the following 
aecount of the Bedis as traders in Sialkot : — ' Formerlj' a race of Bedis from Dera Baba 
Nanak were wont to bring large herds of cattle for sale at stated periods. The arrival of 
these hers or droves were looked forward to with much interest. The Bedis divided the 
Doabs out among themselves, and considered the villa.ijes their constituents, to whom long 
eredit was purposely allowed in order that the extra charge in the bill, in honour of the 
Guru, might be overlooked, but they have given up coming regularly, and so the people are 
driven to the Bar or to Amritsar fairs to purchase : ' Sialkot Sett. Rep., 1865, § 123. 

t The Sodhis of Anandpur are the descendants of Suraj Mai (not Surat Mai, as printed 
in lot of the Punjab Gunsus Report, 1892;, son of Guru Hargobind and are called the 
hare mel ke S)dhi, as opposed to the chhote mei ke Sodhi or Mina Sodhis. 



Khatri marriage. 513 

The ages of betrothal and marriage. — The age of the betrothal ii> the 
case of the Khatris depends on the status of the group. For example 
in Rawalpindi, where the Khatris are proportionately most numerous, 
the age of betrothal varies. It is stated to be from 4 — 8 for girls 
among the Khokhard,n and Bdris, and 8 — 10 among the BunjAhis. 
Marriage follows at 8 — 12 among the former and at 10 — 12 among the 
latter. There is no mukldwa and married life commences at 13 — 15 in 
all the groups. In Gurgaon the Khatris, as a body, are said nob to 
practise infant marriage. 

The traditional origin of the groups. — The origin of the division into 
the four groups called Bd;ri, Bunjiihi, Sarin, and Khokhrd,n, is said to 
be that AM-ud-din Khilji attempted to impose widow-marriage upon 
the Khatris. The western Khatris resolved to resist the innovation, 
and sent a deputation of 52 [hdwan] of their members to represent 
their case at court ; but the eastern Khatris were afraid to sign the 
memorial. They were therefore called followers of Shara Ayin or the 
Muhammadan customs — hence Sarin— while the memorialists were 
called Bdwanjai from the number of the deputation or of the clans 
respectively represented by the members of the deputation ; hence 
Bunjdhi. The Khokhran section is said to consist of the descendants 
of certain Khatris who joined the Khokhars in rebellion, and with whom 
the other Khatri families were afraid to intermarry ; and the Bari 
section, of the lineage of Mehr Chand, Kahn Chand, and Kapur Chand, 
three Khatris who went to Delhi in attendance upon one of Akbar's 
Rd,jput wives, and who, thus separated from the rest of the caste, 
married only within each other's families. There are however other 
accounts, which vary in details, and of these the most circumstantial is 
as follows :— When A]d.-ud-din Khilji attempted to impose the custom 
of widow remarriage on the Khatris, those of the caste who lived at 
Delhi and Sirhind said they would abide by the decision of the Khatris 
of Lahore, who in turn referred the matter to the Khatris of Multan. 
It was thereupon determined to resist the Imperial edict, but the 
Khatris of the Bd^ri Doab, of Ark and of Sirhind were afraid to aMliore 
to this resolve, and in consequence they formed the Saiin group. On 
the other hand the 377 sections, called Uchandi, deputed 56 of their 
number to urge their cause at Delhi, and thus the remaining 321 sec- 
tions became known as the Ansdr or supporters. Of the 56 sections 
deputed to Delhi, 52 became the H unjahi- Kaldn or Khns (or senior 
Bunjdhi), and four became Dhd^ighar. This latter sub-group was form- 
ed of the three eponymous sections, Khanna, Kapur and Mehra, 
whose ancestors, at the instigation of their mother, had headed the re- 
sistance to the imperial will. To these the Seth-Kakar were affiliated. 

This explanation of the origin of tho Dbd-ighar is hardly tenabje 
because these sections are by no means exclusively Dh^ighar. The 
legend does not attempt to explain the origin of the Bari group, or of 
the Chdrghar and other sub-groups. As to the term Sarin, the deriva- 
tion from shard' 'ain (because they adopted the shard' or Muham- 
madan Law), is often given, but the word is most probably a corruption 
of sreni, a line, or a guild of traders. Sreni is, Sir H. Risley notes, a 
common term for sub-caste in Bengal. It also recalls the word Srenika 
the other name or title of Bimbisara : see p. 505 supra. 



514 Khatri Kulinism. 

The results of the Khatri social system. — The general principle under 
lyin^ the Khatri organization appears to be perfectly clear, and is that 
the higher (and therefore in the nature of things the narrower) the 
circle within which a daughter may be given in marriage, the more 
exalted is the social position of the family in its own group. This prin- 
ciple finds full scope in the Bari group, within which the social status 
of a family may constantly change, while the section, as a whole, has 
no fixed status. In the two lower groups the sections appear to be 
more definitely allotted, as it were, to the various groups. This how- 
ever is a very obscure point and I need not pursue it further here. It 
is sufl&cient to note that hypergamy leads to its usual results, though 
owing to the general complexity of the Khatri organization and' to its 
endless local variations it is not possible to do more than state those 
results generally. 

In the first place there is competition, in the lower groups, for sons- 
in-law, so that marriage expenses are as the author of the Tawdrikh-i' 
Qaum Khatridn says, ruinous among the Sarin, very heavy among the 
Bunjdhis, heavy among the B^raghars, and very slight among the 
Dh^ighars. 

But this was not the only result. In 1852 Sir Herbert Edwarde?, 
then Deputy Commissioner of Jullundur, described how the Lahoris"^ 
used to make away with the girl-wives they obtained from the Bunjahis 
in order that they might obtain fresh brides and fresh dowries. The 
Biiris, as a whole, are to this day in the same position, and however 
.poor or distressed a Bari may be, he is sure of getting a wife with a 
handsome dower from a respectable Bunjahi family : (Patid-la). If a 
Bunjahi wife died, when married to a Bdri, it was callously said :— 
' ptirdna chula, ghijadid,' or ' if the hearth be cold, the ghi is fresh/ 
meaning that the dead wife could be easily replaced. 

As might well be expected strenuous efforts have from time to tittl^ 
been made by the lower to shake off the social tyranny of the higher 
crroups and these have met with some measure of success. The man- 
oeuvres of the various groups concerned are too complicated lor de- 
scription here, but it may be said that the results have been, in Gujrdt, 
to sever all connection between the Bdris and the Bari-Bunjahis, so that 
the latter are now api^uvntly endogamous, while in Patiala and Jul- 
lundur the object seems to be to make the Bdris reciprocate by giving 
wives to the Bunjd.his, and this object is said to have been attained. 
Thus, generally speaking, the tendency is to revolt against the inequit- 
able rule of hypergamy and transform the hypergamous groups into 
endoa"amous sub-castes. The close resemblances in this system to the 
institution known as Kulinism in Bengal need not be pointed out. 

The Khatri got ?^ames.— -Folk-etymology would derive Sarin from 
suriii, ' warrior,' but the derivation already given is more probable. 

It is also said that Khukran (Khokharan) is derived from Karakhan 
descendants of Krukhak, * one of the sons of Manu,' who settled and 
reigned in the North. West Punjab. 

* Meaning, obviously, the Bari-Lahoria, especially the Dhaighar. 



The Khatri sections. 515 

The got names proper are popularly derived from various titles and 
so on^ and are cited as proofs of the ancient military character 
of the caste. Thus Bhalla is derived from hhall, a spear. Bhasiu from 
hhas, brilliancy, and ten, master, i.e., the sun. Bohra from huha, 
a column in military array, and it is said that in the United 
Provinces a 6 it/ia is still drawn and worshipped on the Dasehra day. 
Dliawan, or Dhavan, is said to mean a messenger on the field of 
battle. Kakkar is said to be originally Karkar, ' strong ' or ' powerful '; 
and Kapur to mean the moon, ' Karpur.' Khanna is even derived from 
khan, a mine and said to mean sapper. But another account says it 
means that ' half ' the family became Brahman. Kochar is said to come 
from havach, ' armour,' Mahendruis naturally derived from Mahendra, 
'lord of the earth' or ' chief.^ Mehra is also derived from Mihir, 
the sun. The i^Jilii got declares that its ancestors were once bankers and 
are styled Sh^hji, Sahni, Seni are both said to be corruptions of the 
Sanskr. ' Sainani/ the head of an army or general. Seth, freshta, means 
rich and also a raja. Tandan is also said to be an abbreviation of 
martancl and to mean the sun, but it is also said to mean warrior. A 
Tcahit describes the relations of some of the gots thus : — 

Bade Baderd, Puri, pardn, — Kochar, Nandd hhu pariudn, 

Sohni, Mehtd, Edndd, Saigal, — Bhalld, Eholar, Dugal, Upal, 
Tinsau BiVnjdhi, Zdt Bunjahe'—Nand-ghan^ Bdnddn hardn hhde ; 

Sihh-Bhunjdhi, Mol, Dharmdn, — Ndtd Kare haro paricdn. 

" The Badi) Buujahis are the highest, the Pun's are the like, the Kochars and Nandis are 
Rajas, the Sohni, etc. (the 12 tribes) and the 300 Bunjahi tribes and the Nandghan are such 
that there is no Impediment to contracting marriages with them. " 

The Khatris have not, as a caste, any distinctive caste customs, but 
many of their sections have special usages on various occasions. 

In ArabAla the Khatris cslebrate a wife's first pregnancy by the 
'custom ' called rii. Her parents send her sweets, clothes and cash. 
Sati is specially worshipped on this occasion, with other deities. 

The Puris of the Bunjdhi group cook a mess of harhi, two and a 
half mats^ full, on this occasion, and also worship a patri or small 
board like a slate. The karhi, which is made of gram flour, is distri- 
buted among the brotherhood. 

In this section again on the birth of a son shira,f weighing about 
IJ mans kacha or some 40 lbs., is made and distributed among the 
brotherhood. The family barber also make a goat out of it. Taking 
a reed he splits it up into two or four pieces, bleating all the while 
like a goat. For making this idol the barber gets 7 Mansuri pice as 
his fee, and a rupee is also given to the family parohit. 

The popular idea as to the origin of the devkaj is that once a 
Khatraui with a child in her arms met the Brahman Pars E^m and, 
in her terror, fled, leaving the child behind her. A wild cat was about 
to devour it when some kites appeared and spread their wings over 
it. Now Rajd Kans, Krishna's maternal uncle, had been told by his 
astrologers that his sister's eighth son would kill him, so when Krishna 
was born he was replaced by a girhchild whom Rdjd Kans killed. 
She was dashed upon a washerman's board, but fell in the Himalayas 

* Large earthen vessels. 

t A kind of pudding, made of flour, sugar and a little ghi. 



516 Special got customs, 

where she is worshipped as Bhajan Bashni Devi,* and it is apparently 
in commemoration of that event that the mother of a first-born son 
among the Chopra, Kapur, Kakkar, Khanne and Malhotra Khatris 
leaves her husband^s house, after the child^s birth, and takes refuge 
in a relative's house, but not in her parents' home. Thence she is 
brought back by her husband as if she were a bride, and a symbolical 
remarriage takes place, but without the usual Vedic mantras being 
read, 

The Abrola section has a tradition that a snake was once born to 
one of its members. One night it fell into a pot and next night died 
from the blows of the churning-stick. So Abrolas never churn or 
make butter and never kill a serpent. 

The Anand give no alms on a Sankrd,nt, the first of a solar month. 
Their women tabu ghi for the hair. The Nand appear to be the same 
as the Anand. 

The Bahl will not remain in Delhi at night. They may visit it in 
the day time but must leave it before dark. 

The Bejal Set.hs, a section of the Dilwdli (of Delhi) Khatris observe 
the following usasre at a tonsure. The rite is always performed at the 
door of the house, and when the family barber prepares to shear the 
child's hair, two persons disguised as Mughals, one having a bow 
«nd arrow in his hand, and th-^ other a shoe, stand close to him. They 
r.-'>iM,iii in this posture until the shearing of the child is over. The 
child then enters the house, and the females of the family, when they 
see him with his hair shorn, bpo'in to beat their breasts and cry hai ! 
hai ! merd hioi munda, Sethon jaya hin munda : " Woe ! woe ! who 
shaved my son, who shaved the son of a Seth ?" They regard, or 
pretend to regard, that day as an unlucky one, and observe a kind of 
pretended mourning for the next 24 hours. The daily food is not cooked 
on that day, and even the lamps of the house are lighted, not by the 
members of the family, but by a neighbour. Curious and laughable as 
this ceremony may appear to be, it has not sprung up without a cause. 
It has its origin in the following story : — 

Once upon a time the son of a poor Seth had on account of the poverty of his parents 
passed the prescribed a,s:e of tonsure, and having been not properly looked after, was 
suffering from lice which had gro^vn in abundance over his head. He Avas one day seen on 
the road, weeping and crying bitterly from the pain they occasioned him, by two Mughals, 
who felt such compassion for him that, having by chance met a barber, they ordered him to 
cut off the child's hair then End there. The barber knowing that the object of their com- 
passion was a Khntri's son who could not be shorn without the formal ceremony, refused to 
comply with thoir demand. The Mughals seeing that he was obstinate in his refusal 
resolved to use force : one of them beat him with his shoes and the other pointing his arrow 
threatened hira with instant death if he failed to shave the child on the spot The terrified 
barber had no alternative left but to. cut the child's hair without further loss of time. 
When this had been done, the Mughals let the barber go and told the child to go his way 
home. The child accordingly returned to his house with his hair thus shorn. The females of 
the family were shocked at the child's appearance, and thought this unceremonious shearing 
of his hair very unlucky. They all began to beat their breasts and burst into lamentation. 
It was a day of regular mourning for the whole family.f

during a thunderstorm the maternal uncle and nephew will not sit or stand or sleep in the 
same room.

Khatris, Beri — Bhanddri. 617 

The Beri are an offshoot of the Chopra and ascribe their name to the 
fact that their ancestor was born under a beri tree. 

Among the Bhadwdr the ceremony of putting on the sacred thread for 
the first time is thus observed: — When the boy is of an age to don 
the janeo bis father, with his brotherhood and a band of musicians, 
goes on one day to tbe sweeper's house to invite a black bitch to the 
feast at the ceremony ; next day, the family priest (parohit) brings 
the black bitch together with the sweeper to his master's house. 'J'he 
parohit performs a certain ceremony of worship to the bitch. Then 
all the different dishes cooked for the ceremony are put in a large 
brass dish, and placed before the bitch, and the members of the family 
fold their hands before her and so continue until she eats somethino- 
from the dish. They will even wait sitting till the evening, if she doel 
not touch the food. After the bitch has eaten, the remains and a red 
cloth are given to the sweeper. After that Brahmans are feasted, 
and then the members of the family may eat. The origin of this rite 
is said to be that the Bhadwd-rs once lived towards Delhi and when the 
Muhammadan rulers tried to convert them to that faith they fled from 
that tract but many were murdered. One of their women who was far 
advanced in pregnancy gave birth to a male child and abandoned it, 
she herself escaping. The child was however carried away by a blnck 
bitch and suckled by her, so when he grew up he directed his descend- 
ants to adore the black bitch fur ever. 

Bhalla, Bahl, Udnda, Sidl, and Sahharwal Khatris. — The bhaddan 
ceremony is performed by Sidls, Bahls and Bhallas, at the age of five 
in the K^ngra hills, by Hondas at Ram Tirth near Amritsar and by 
Sabbarwd,ls at their houses after 13 days of the birth of a child. 

Among the Bhanddris at the birth of a child the mother is made to 
sleep on the ground. Seven thorns of a ktkar ov jandi tree are buried 
in the earth under her pillow. Bread or anything made of corn is 
avoided for the first three days, only milk being given her for food. 
On the fourth day churrna (a mixture of flour, ghi and sugar) is 
prepared and given her to eat and what she cannot eat is buried uhder 
her bed. On the 13fch day she puts on a barber's shoes, leaves her 
room and resumes to her household duties. No cause is assigned for 
the burying of the thorns. At the bhadan munan ceremony a jandi 
tree is cut and a kite feasted. The mother affects displeasure and 
goes to a neighbour's house, but is brought back by her husband who 
gives her some ornament or cash. 

The boy becomes a Sanyasi, or recJuse, and begs alms of his brother- 
hood. Out of the alms, which generally comprise flour, chiirma is 
made and offered by the boy to his Brahman gtirii, and then distributed 
amongst all the brotherhood. 

Among the Bhandd,ris the jaweo is generally performed at 8 or 9 
years of age. On the evening before, the family parohit invites a kite 
to the feast riext morning. Before the rite begins bread, khir, etc., 
are sent to the kite, then Brahmans are feasted, and lastly the brother- 
hood. Then the boy is shaved, the family imrohit shaving first one 
lock of hair and receiving Rs. 5-4 as his fee, the remainder being shaved 
by the barber. The janeo is put on after the boy has bathed and he

then cuts a branch of a ^'aw^t tree. After him his motber, whom her 
husband kicks, goes away displeased [riishar), to her parents who, 
if not residents of the same place, visit 'it on this occasion. On his 
return from cuttino: the jandi, finding his mother orone, the hoy, 
together with his father and the brotherhood go to appease and fetch 
her back. Her Imsband (the boy's father) pacifies her and bring.^ her 
back home. Sometimes she is given an ornament or some other thing 
to conciliate her. 

This custom also prevails among the Mokol and other Bunjdhi 
Khatris 

The Bhandaris, like the Hdndas, affect Shaikh Faiid who once met 
a company of them in a wilderness. They entertained him and in 
return he said : tiimhdrd hhanddrd hhard rahe, ' May your store-house 
remain full. ' Thenceforth they were called Bhandari. They have 
three sub-sections, the Ber-pdlni : so called because an orphan was 
brought up by his sister {ber-hahin) , the P^itni, from Pakpattan, and 
the Bhoria, so called because its founder was brought up in an 
underground room, [hhora-tah-hhdna). Weddings are celebrated by 
a visit to Bal^la, in Gurdaspur, as that town is regarded as their 
orig-inal settlement. 

The Bhagre do not worship a chil but the ok, for, they say, this plant 
saved the life of Bd-bd, Mumali, one of their progenitors, by feeding him 
with its juice, when as a new born baby, he was thrown away by his 
mother, who was fleeing for her life. A J^t maid-servant known as 
Bharwain Mdt^, who had accompanied the mother in her flight, rescued 
the child some 20 days after its abandonment, and she is commemorated 
at weddings when 2| J^t females (2 adults and a girl) are fed. The 
Bl.aore perform the hhaddan in the Kdngra Hills, and ancestor worship 
at Burj Lattan in Jagraon tahsil, Ludhiiina, on 1 5th Katak. They came 
orio-inally from Sirsa. The name Bhagar means corn of very inferior 
quality, and was given them by a Bh^t, because he got corn of that 
quality from one of their ancestors, who was distributing grain durinpf 
a famine, the truth being that the Bhdt only came when the good grain 
was all gone and nothing but bhagar remained. 

The Bhalla in Hoshidrpur always have a sweeper present at a wed- 
diucr because a sweeper protected their female ancestor during Pars 
Rdm's persecution. 

The Bhuchar got is said to have been originally Talw^r. One of 
that got left a son without any one to protect it, but a buffalo and a 
kite took care of it. His mother, who had abandoned him owing 
to her poverty, found him again and called him ' Bhuchar,' as he was 
well-fed and developed. This got feeds kites at weddings and it has 
also preserved the buffalo's horns, one being kept by the Bhuchars of 
Delhi and the other by those of Nawashahr in Jullundur. 

The Chadda hold the a^ sacred, because they say their forefathers 
once fought with Babar near Emindb^d and all fell, save one who hid 
under an ah bush. He refounded the section and it still performs the 
munnan at Emiu^bdd and worships the ak. 



Khatris, Cham — Dhand. 5!^ 

The Cham, a got of Bunj^hi status, were really Tannan Kapurs, but 
one of their ancestors accepted a cham (skin) from a Cham^r iu ' pay- 
ment of monies due to him, whence the name. Followers of Guru 
Kdm Rai, the Cham, have satis at Tungaheri in Ludhiana tahsil aiul at 
Kiratpur in Ambdla. They perform the bhaddan like a wedding in 
most respects, but they do not worship the chil or ak One peculiarity 
in connection with the rite is thaf, all the food for it is cooked on a fire 
produced by rubbing two pieces of pldh wood together. The fire must 
also be kindled by members of the family only and uatil it is made food 
or drink is avoided. A parohit may join in the ceremony, but no one 
else can take part in it. The boy too becomes a Sany^si, but is brouo-ht 
back home by his sisters. ^ 

The Chhotra got is an offshoot oE the Dhirs, and worships a serpent 
and a Muhammadan mirdsi because once a serpent fed Bd,b^ Malla 
their ancestor, with its tail, and a mirdsi taking him from the reptile 
nursed him, when he had been abandoned as a child by his mother 
who was fleeing For her life. Chhotra is derived from chhutnd to leave, 
and the section has a sati at Amargarh, in Patiala, where there is an 
image of a serpent also. 

The Chhura Khatris still commemorate Bhai Lalu, whose shrine is 
situate at Dalla in Kapurthala, by an annual fair. By repeatino- his 
name or legend intermittent fever is cured. His grandson, Salamat 
Uai, was importuned by Maharaia Ranjit Singh to pray for his recovery 
from a mortal sickness. This the Baba refused to do, but he crave threo 
yt'rirs of his own life to prolong; that of his master, and in gratitude 
Ranjit Singh spent a crore of rupees on the golden temples at Benares, 
Amritsar, Hardwar and Jawalamukhi. 

The Chopra are also called Chopra Rajava, Jat;,?) and Qdnuncro 
Chopra. They claim descent from one Chaupat Rai. Once, they say, 
they lived at Benares, but incurring the wrat^h of Chandragupta went 
to the Dsccan, where Chaupat Rai, their ancestor, was slain in battle 
by Sultan Mahmud. The Chopra are uamsd after him, bu: are really 
Surajbansi. 

The Chopra and Kakkar perform a son's hhaddan ceremonv in his 
5th year. Oa this occasion the boy's father goes away, and the mother 
too goes rushe (being displeased) to the house of a relation. Then 
thn boy's father, with some of his relatives, follows her there. They first 
kick her slightly and then appease her M,nd bring her back home after 
tying her garment to her husband's chddar or dupatfa. 

The Chopras give from Re. J to Rs. 31 (at most) in cash as the 
bride's dowry at her marriage. At a girl's marriage her mother also 
asks alms for her of the women of the got; and at a son's wedditio- he is 
given a plough. The Chopras do not use khand but gur only at 
weddings. 

The Dhand got performs the jan(}i rite about 2 years after the birth 
of a son. Three top-knots are left on the child's head and until the 
hhaddan is observed no razor may be applied to it, nor may the boy 
wear a shirt. The hhaddan is celebrated with much eclat, many rites 
similar to those observed at weddings being performed. 



520 Khatris, Dhir — Jhanji. 

l^he Dhir, or ' brave/ section lias a tradition that it once migrated 
from Ajudhia and settled at Kandahar. Expelled thence by the Arab 
invasions it came to the Punjab. The Dhir of Kapurthala are descend- 
ed from Bdb^ Mahya, who was the guru of Guru Amar Dd,s, and is still 
reverenced at Dhir weddings. 

The Dhir, in Ludhidna, feast a woman of the Sindhu Jat tribe on the 
birth of a son, because iu a fight with dacoits, a Dhir fought on even 
after he had lost his head. A Snidhu girl who saw his valour was 
rebuked for standing there to watch the fight and tauntingly asked if it 
was her husband's head that she must look at it. She retorted that it 
was indeed her husband's, and thereupon she became sati. So Dhir 
Khatris commemorate her to this day. 

The Duggal at the maunan don a tragi (a waist band to which a strip 
of cloth is fastened and carried between the legs) oimunj. The strip 
of cloth must be red and the ^agrri too must be of that colour. The boy 
must also wear wooden sandals and carry ^fakir's wallet {hagli). He 
cries Alakh (the mendicant's cry) and his kinswomen give him alms. 
He then runs away, pretending to be displeased, but his sister or 
brother's wife or father goes after him to conciliaie him and gives him 
something. The rite is performed outside the village. A goat is killed 
and a drop of its V,lood applied to the bov's forehead. The flesh is 
cooked and eaten on the spot and what remains is buried there. Till 
the maunan is performed at the age of 5, 7, or 9, the boy's head must 
not be shaved with a razor, but his hair may be cut with scissors. 

The Gundis are a section of the Khatris found in Gujrd,fc and said to 
Ipe the only community of the caste found in that District. They say 
that the emperor Balilol brought them from Sidlkot and established 
them at Bahlolpui' in Gujrat. They are agriculturists and think that to 
relapse into trade would be derogatory. 

The H^nda perform the maunan at Pdkpattan, alleging that Shaikh 
Farid-ud-din Shakarganj is their patron. North of Lahore the Hd,nda 
resort to a tank near Gujrat town to perform the maunan, carrying 
the youngsters about to undergo it in procession with drums and music. 
A brick from Shakh Farid's shrine has been thrown into the tank there 
and so made it sacred. The Handas will not eat animals slaughtered 
hy jhatkd (strikinij; off the head at a blow) after the Hindu fashion, but 
cut their throats like the Musalmans. A H^nda bridegroom has a 
piece of red silk, weighing Ig; told (half ounce), tied to the strings of his 
chapkan (coat), and when he reaches the bride's house he opens it and 
puts it before his mouth with the right hand like a handkerchief. 

Among the Jaidke at the hhaddan the boy becomes a Sanydsi and 
is brought home by his sisters. 

The Jerath or Jaret also venerate the kite [ckil) because it, saved the 
life of their progenitor. 

The Jhanji section has a peculiar observance called (hengna (lit. a 
tiresome child). Tlie sweeper of the bride's parents makes a male 
figure of wood, with clothes, and dances it before the bridegroom's 
party, who give him a rupee. Halwd is thrown to the kites when the 
bride reaches her husband's house, and after the wedding the party 
goes to worship the gods. 



KJiatrisy Jiwar — Khannd-, 521 

The Jiwar are Sikhs and Murg^i* Khatris by origin. One of the 
Murgd-is called Bdbd, Dari (Dari Chak in Ainritsar is ctilled after him), 
was a Sikh of Guru Ndnak. He had a son named Md,nak Chand, who 
came to Gondwd,! where his father-in-laws were and being a Sikh of the 
Gurus, went to the third Guru, Amar Dds, who lived at Goudwdl. 
The Guru bade him break the bed of the Mauli Sd,hib. A Idoli or 
tank had been dug at Gondw^l, but owing to the hard clay, the water 
level could not be reached, and so Manak Cliand was ordered to break 
through the level clay while others were busy in the excavation. 
Tiirough his exertions the water was reached but he himself was drown- 
ed and for full three days no trace was found of his body. Oil the 
third day his mother-in-law went to complain to the third Guru, and 
he came to the spot and called ' Mdnak Chand,' whereupon his body 
swam out of the water. The Guru touched it with liis feet and Mdnak 
Chand came to life again. So the Guru bade that his descendants 
should be called Jiwar (from jina which means living) and none are 
now called Murgd,i. 

The Kaura, a got of Bunj^hi status, are really, Kapurs. The name 
means * bitter ' and is thus explained: 'A woman far advanced in 
pregnancy became sati and her child was bom near an ak plant. It 
was found on the third day after its birth sucking the tail of a serpent, 
while a kite shadowed it with its wings. As the ak is a bitter plant 
and the kite {cMl) is considered poisonous the boy was called Kaura. 
And when a twig is cut from s, jandi tree, a rite performed at weddings, 
a chil is feasted and food placed near a serpent's hole and also near an 
ak, round which a thread too is wound when a child is teething, its 
head is shaved clean only four top-knots being left. A confection 
{halwd) cooked on a fire that is produced from stones, is then distri- 
buted to the brotherhood, a he-goat made of halwd having been previ- 
ously slaughtered. The Kaura are followers of Guru Rflra Dd,9, at 
whose shrine the hhaddan is performed and all the top-knots are then 
shaved clean off. 

The Khanna Khatris take their sons for the ceremony of maunan, or 
first head-shaving, to Dip^lpur, talisil Chunian, in Lahore, owing to a 
belief founded on the following legend : — A Brahman, named Laha, was 
childless and went into the hdr, or wilds of Lahore, to practiee austeri- 
ties, which he performed with such success as to draw upon him the 
favour of Chandika (Durga), the patron goddess of the clan, who 
granted him a son ; but as he vvas too old to iDeget one, she gave him 
one ready grown up called Jasr^j,t on condition that no abusive epithet 
was to be applied to him. Like all spoilt children he was wayward and 
fretful, and his adoptive mother, forgetting the warning, one day said 
to him : Tu 7iiggar jd, '' sink into the earth,'' because he would not 
heed her c?il from the door to come into the house. He immediately 
sank into the earth, and the old woman was only just able to save him 

* Murgai doubtless means ' teal.' 

t A variant from Kapurthala makes the goddess Jvihanglaj (? Hinglaj), and says the 
boy's name was a Liihi Jasrai. Once he was sent to the lazar fcr turmeric but dawdled 
over the errand. When his step-mother scolded him he sank into the earth and the 
Brahman in vsin invoked the goddess, who declared that what had teen could not be 
undone, but promisi d that the sh line of Bilba Lalu JpFrsi shculd be ■v^o^?hipptd by the 
Kbannas throughout all ages. 



582 Khatns, Kapur — Mehndru, 

by his top-knot. And su Klianaa boys to this day never wear a 
top-knot. 

The Kapflr, Malhotra, and Seth Khatris may perform the maunan 
ceremony anywhere; provided there is no river or well containinsf water 
from Dipdlpur. 

At a son's hhaddan among the Khosla"^ (Sarin) the parohit goes on 
the previous evening to invite an eagle to the feast. Next morning 
before the shaving is begun, four loaves, a small quantity of confection- 
ery {sira halwd) and two pice are put on the house for the eagle. When 
these things have been taken away by an eagle the ceremony may be 
performed. The eagle is feasted in the same manner at weddings 
soon after the bride comes to her father-in-law's house for the first 
time. 

The Kochhar claim to be an offshoot of the Seth and pay their founder 
was left an orphan, his father having been slain in battle. He was 
brought up by his sister and th.eir name is derived from hochhar, 'lap.' 
The Kochhart have an interesting custom connected with a bride's first 
pregnancy. Six months after her pregnancy she deliberately feigns 
displeasure with the members of the family and goes to some other 
house. The bridegroom on hearing of her departure goes in search of 
her after having his head, moustaches and beard clean shaved. 
When he 6nds out where she is, he collects a few of his brotherhood 
and goes to the place where she is staying. After many entreaties 
he promises to give her an ornament, and then takes her back to his 
own house. 

The Koli or Kohli got whose original home was at Jamsher, a village 
in Jullundur, worship the kite at tlie hhaddan rite. They eschew the 
use of dry cotton plants as fuel because a snake once got mixed 
up with them and was burnt to ashes. 

The Likhi got performs the hhaddan in the Kangra Hills and ancestor 
worship at a sati in Dhaipai, Ludhidna tahsil. They cut a jandi 
tree and worship a chil in the usual way. 

Among the Mehndru — a section of the B^rhi — and the Ghands — a 
section of the Bunjdhi — the head of the boy who is to don the janeo 
is shaved quite clean with a razor, and he is then disguised as a 
faqir with a munj rope {tragi) round his loins, wooden shoes (kharnn- 
wdn on his feet, a wooden phdori in his hand, a deerskin under his arm, 
a laneo made of mnnj rope, one jholi or wallet in his right hand and 
another under his left arm, and goes round begging alms of his assembled 
kinsmen and friends. Whatever he gets in hia&rat jholi he gives to his 
owrw, who gives him the jaweo and whispers the prescribed mantra in 
his ear. This rite is called the guru mantar dend or sanskdr dena. 
The contents of the second jholi he gives to his parohit. Worship 
on this occasion is not restricted to any particular deity. 



* Folk- etymology, of course, derives the name of this section from Tchosnd, to rob. Cf. the 
Khosa Jits and Baloch. „. , , 

t A Kochhar husband shaves his head and face clean — as Hindus do on a father'g 
death— when his wife conceives for the first time.— (Si^lkot.) 



The Malhotra Khatris. 5^3 

The Melmdru perform the jan</io?i rite, when a child has reached 
the age of 3, 4 or 5, at a pond called Suni^rdnwala, The kinsmen go 
there in the morning, the father's priest carrying on his head a 
brass tray full of khir. The priest walks round the pond until a chil has 
taken away some of the khir, and if no chil appears for two or even 
three days none of the family will eat or drink. When it has taken some 
of the khir the father is congratulated. A he-goat is also taken to the 
tank and, if no chil appear, it is slaughtered at sunset. When the 
chil takes away some of its flesh the father is congratulated. Blood 
is then taken from the goat's ear and a tika made on the boy'i 
forehead with it. The goat^s head and feet are sent by a barber ti* the 
kinsmen and the flesh and khir that remain are distributed to the 
brotherhood. Once, it is said, the got was all but extinct, all the 
males having died of a plague. But a pregnant woman fled from 
Bhera or Khushd,b (the family is still called Bheru or Khushdbi) to her 
father's house, the family parohit accompanying? her. On the way 
she gave birth to a son, and the parohit coming to know of the event 
after they had gone some distance returned and found the boy still alive 
and shadowed by a chil with its feathers. The parohit restored him to 
his mother assuring her that his family would attain greatness. This is 
how chil worship arose in this family. 

The Malhotra got observes the deokaj in the 5th year after the 
birth of the first child, and no Malhotra can marry his eldest son or 
daughter until it has been solemnized. 

Both at a true wedding and at a deokaj the chil or kite is worshipped 
because, it is said, one of those birds once burnt itself alive in the 
chitd or pyre in which a Malhotra widow 'was being burnt with her 
husband. So the got regards the kite as itself a sati and is worshipped 
as such. 

At a weddino- when the marriage party reaches the bride's house a 
goat is demanded from her parents and its ear cut with a knife, a 
drop of the blood being dabbed on the bridegroom's forehead. 

The Sirhiudia Malhotras take boys to Dandrata in Pa^iala for the 
mundan rite, as their guru lived there, and after the boy^s head has 
been shaved his representative gives the child a jhunjhund with a 
knot at each end for the first time. No Malhotra will give his son 
such a toy till thi5 has been done, though he may give him cue with 
a single knot. There too the guru's quilt {gudri) is worshipped and 
jhandulds or bachelor Brahmans are fed. 

A Malhotra wife in the seventh month of her first pregnancy sits in 
t!)e dehli or portico of the house and there removes her nosering and 
laung which she never puts on again. She also gives up dyeing her 
hands and feet with henna, saying thrice — 

Nak nath Idhi, sar matti pdi, asi Idhi Idhi. 
Main Idhun, m,eri hahu Idhe, meri sat kali Idhe. 

" I take off my nosering, throw earth on my head. As I have takoii 
it off so may my son's bride take her's oJBP, and seven generation* of 
my children take it off". 



624 Khairis, Mengi-^Najjart 

The Mengi also do not kill the snake. It was, they say, born to 
one of their ancestors and at the shaving {maunan) rite they worship 
a picture of it. At this ceremony they slice oif of a goat^s ear and 
apply smoke to its nose to make it sneeze. They consider that no good 
luck will come unless the goat sneezes. 

Tlie J\lerwaha claim Central Asian origin, and say they came from 
Merv (Marusthal). They belong to the Sarin group, and say they 
entered the south-west Punjab through the Boldn Pass. Their 
earliest traceable settlement is, however, at Govindwal or Gondwdl, 
in Amritsar, which they say was made into a large place by one Baba 
Govind Rai, a devotee. This man was granted lands in jcigir for giving 
food to a Musalman king, who came to him liungry during a hunting 
expedition. Afterwards one Guru Bhala, wiih wham the MerAvdhas 
had quarrelled, cursed them foi- refusing to allow his followers to drink 
from the same well. Thereupon large numbers of them settled else- 
where. 

The Merwaha perform their maunan ceremony at the shrine of Bdba 
Thaman, at Ramria, 16 miles west of Jhang, and at Kangra. 

The Mithu are goldsmiths, 'iliey have a sati at Talwandi Nimi, in 
Ja^raon tahsil, in Ludiiiana. One of the family, on his way from hia 
facher-in-law's house, with his wife, was killed by a tiger. She became 
sati with him and so the place is visited, every year in Bhddon, and 
seven times mud is taken out ol a pond near by in the neighbourhood 
of Talwandi Nimi. 

Among the Mokol Bunjahi when the janeo rite is performed for . the 
first time (generally between 8 and lU years of age) , is a goat slaughtered 
{haWil karud) by a Qazi, and the paroJiit of the family applies {tika 
lagdnd) a drop of its blood to the forehead of the boy who is to don 
the janeo."* The goat's flesh is then eaten by the brotherhood; but 
they must eat it indoors and no one is allowed to take it outside. Before 
the ceremony is performed the boy is shaved with scissors, and not 
with a razor. At a wedding when the party starts towards the bride's 
villa •'•e, the bridegroom is required to cut a branch of a jand tree 
in his own village, females of the brotherhood accompanying him; and 
he must not return to his own house but go straight to his father-in- 
law's village with the wedding party. 

Among the Najjar wari tuhndi^ prohibited. Waris are made of pulse 
[mungi or mash). Tho pulse is steeped in water for a whole night. 
Then it is ground fine on a stone with a stone or stick, water being 
sprinkled on it when it begins to dry. It is called pilhi (from pisna to 
grind). Spices are then mixed with it, and small cakes made of it by 
hand and spread out on a charfdiy while they are wet, and allowed to 
dry in the sun ; when dried they are kept and cooked as vegetables 
from time to time. This process is called ivari iuhna. 

The Najjar trace their origin to Uch in Bahawalpur. 
The Nandat worship the ah which must not be touched by the women 
of the section, or mentioned by them : they worship it once a year. 



* Mokol Khatn's call in the Mullah at the janeo ddlnd, as Mullahs in old times taught 
their childreu— (Sialkot). 
f The name Nanda or Nenda is derived from nindv, husband's sister. 



Khatri^, Nanda — Saonchi, 625 

Amongst the Pasi at a maunan and a marriage the eagle is worshipped 
in this wise. On the day before the date fixed for the munan or the 
weddings the family priest invites an eagle to a feast on the following- 
morning. Next day, the boy or the girl's father, together with the parvhit, 
goes out taking with him four loaves and a confection [kardh 
parshdd) thereon and puts it before the eagle. Standing barefooted 
with folded hands before her, they beg her to eat the meal {bhojan). 
They must stand in the same position until the eagle takes away part 
of it. ^ 

They then come back and perform the marriage or maunan ceremony 
and feast Brahmans. 

The Puris are sub-divided into three sub-sections, the Sidh Gharmals 
of the Bist Dodb, the Malik Waziri of Lahore and Gujranwala and 
the Kasuri of Lahore, Dharmkot and the Malwa. Bd,ba Sidh Gharmal 
was a saint who originally came from the Mdlwa. At a wedding in 
this got the bride's mother feigns auger and seeks refuge in a 
kinsman^s house, until her husband soothes her displeasure and she is 
brought back amid the songs of the girls of the kindred. In some 
Puri families a mother never drinks milk after the birth of a child. 
Others cut off a goat's ear with a sword at a birth, stain the child's 
forehead with its blood, and then kill and eat the goat at a feast of all 
the brotherhood. 

The Rih^n, a got of Bunjdhi status, perform hhaddan at Nangal, in 
tahsil Nakodar in Jullundur, after cutting a jaudi twig, which is 
worshipped on the Janamashtmi day. A he-goat, whose ear has been 
previously pierced near the jandi is taken home and beheaded by the 
eldest male of the family with an iron weapon. The flesh is distributed 
to the brotherhood and the bones and blood buried in the house-yard. 
On Sundays Brahmaus are not allowed to see or use milk and curds in 
a Rihan's house. The following tale is told of the origin of this cus- 
tota : — During the Muhammadan period all the women of the section, 
and the wife of their parohit determined to save their honour hy throw- 
ing themnelves into a well, but the par ohitni' 8 heart failed her, so |he 
other women called her a Chandd,lni and thus milk and curds, the best 
ol earthly things, have been prohibited to their Brahmans on Sundays 
ever since. The tardgi rite, which consists in putting a thread round 
the loins, is observed at a high mound, said to be the ruins of a village, 
near Ghdlib Kaldn, in Jagraon tahsil, in Ludhiana. The !^n•il■e Khatris 
of Del hi also visit this mound and offer a cloth, etc., there after a wed- 
ding, as it was their original home and was called Kerariwala. 

The vSaonchi section of the Bunjahis has a curious rite on the Sth 
audi of Asauj. The arms of every male, even a new-born boy, are both 
incised with razors until blood oozes from the cuts. Kunga, a red 
powder, is then sprinkled on them by way of worship, ajid the blood is 
dubbed on the forehead. An idol shaped like a headless man is also 
made and a knife placed near its right hand. It is then worshipped.

influences and so grow thin are bathed and cured completely. Corn 
is vowed on recovery. 

The Soi perform the bhaddan in the Kdngra Hills, aud that of cutting 
the yari(/i tiee at their own villages. They worship their ancestors at 
Jangpur in Ludbidna tabsil at the Diwdli. 

The Tuli got is so named because its founder was being carried away 
by a torrent when he caught hold of a tula, a small toy made of grass 
or reeds and shaped like a boat, in which lamps are put. By its aid he 
was savdS and so was called Tuli. 

Uppal is said to mean ' stone/ and this got performs the bhaddan rite 
whenever its gums from Anandpur, in Hoshi^rpur, visit them. Each 
guru gets IJ rupees and gives in return a small pagri. A few days 
after a cbild^s birth, its mother takes it to a sati's place outside the 
village and then to the tomb of Baw^ Lai. whom Muhammadans call 
Shdh Kamal. Offerings of bagar (pounded rice) are made at both 
places. The chihi^s head is shaved at the first place and a shirt and 
some ornaments put on at the second. 

The Wadhera make offerings of luchis at the shrine of Bdba Tomba, 
when a boy at the age of 1^ years dons a .shirt for the first time, and 
regard it as a good omen if kites take the offerings : when a boy first 
dons shoes, at the age of 6, the ear of a he-goat is cut and water 
sprinkled on the anin al ; if the goat shivers it is auspicious. In either 
case the spirits of deceased ancestors are supposed to be propitiated. 
At 11 a boy's head is shaved and he declares that he must forsake his 
home and study m the forests, but his sisters bring him back, and, in 
the case of the eldebt sou, the mother leaves her home, going to a re- 
lative's house, and there she remams until her husband comes with a 
wedding procession and marries her again. 

KHATfAK (Khatak). — A tribe of Pathdns which claims descent from Luq- 
mdn alias KhataW, one of the sops of Kodai. The Kiataks, as related 
in the article on Pathaus, claim themselves to be Pathans of the Kar- 
Idrni branch. By his Urmar wife Karl^r7iai had two sons Kodai and 
' Kakai. The former had six or seven sons, including Luqinan, and a 
daughter who m;uried a Sayyid Muhamuiad, and had by him two 
sons, Honai'^ and Wardag whom Karlanii adopted. 

The story goe? that Luqman^ while out hunting with his brothers, 
met four Afghan damsels of another tribe. Luqman chose the best- 
dressed — but she was the worst-favoured, being plain, dark and 
stout. His brothirs scoffed at him, saying Luqman -pah khatai Idr, 
'Luqman is in the mud/ whence he was nick-named Khatak. His bride, 
however, bore him two sons Tormanf and Boldq. Torman had two sons 
Tarai and Tarakai, but as the former was the abler, his descendants and 
those of Tarakai too are styled Taris. Hence the Khataks are divided 
into main branches, Tari and Bolaq— aud to the latter belongs the 
Bang! Kbel, descendants of Bangai, son of Sdghari, son of Bolaq. 



* Honis, descendants of Honai, were to be found round Nllib dwelling among the 
Khataks tvpo centuries ago. The Kaka Khel are much venerated by the Khataks as 
descended from the Sayyid Muhammad, and are probably Honis. The shrine of the Kaka 
Sahib belongs to this family, of which Shaikh Rahim-Yar was a member.

Thanks to B^bar's Memoirs and Khushlial Khdn Kliatak's history 
of the ti'ibe the annals of the Khataks are singularly complete. 
Many years after Bd,bar had acquired K^bul, the Khataks either taking 
advantage of tlie coufusion which prevailed in the conBnes of the 
Delhi kingdom, or driven from their original seats in the 8hinwal range 
(in Waziristdn), separated from thpir kinsmen the Shitak Karlarnis 
and moved north-west, towards the Lowa-G har range, Karbogha, Tirait, 
into Chauntra, to Ildchi (Ld,chi) and the Shakardarra towards the Indus. 
At this time Kohat (Lower Bangash) was in the possession of the Orakzai 
Pathans with whom the Khataks were at feud, and the latter in alliance 
with the tribes of Upper Bangash defeated the Orakzais in two fights 
at Tapi and Muhammadzai near Koh^t town, compelling them to fall 
back towards Tir^h, while the Khataks themselves pushed on towards 
Nilab, Patid,la and Sunid,la on tiie Indus. Driving the Awdns before 
them the Khataks pushed their inroads as far as Sakesar, Bliera 
andKhushdb, occupied Makhad and for a considerable period held 
Kalabagh. In Akbar's reign Malik Akor or Akorai became a vassal 
of the emperor and in 1587 he founded Akora, on the south bank 
of the Kabul, and his son Yahyti. seized upon the territory of the 
Mnndar Pathdns which lay nearest to that river. Tliis tract became 
known as Tari-BoMq from the two sections of the Khataks which held 
it. They failed, however, to subjugate the whole Mandar tribe and 
were only al)le to establish a footing on the northern bank of the K^bul 
opposite Akora. 

In 1630 the nliis or tribal levy of the Khataks joined in the 
combined attack by the Path^n tribes round Peshdwar on that fortress, 
although their Arhdb Shahbdz Khd,n was with the Mughals at Peshdwar 
at the time."^ The Mughal authority was, however, soon re-established, 
and in 1659 Khuslihdl Khd^n, who had now succeeded his father 
Shahbdz in the chieftainship,t was employed by them in an expedition 
against the Afridis and Orakzais of Tirah, whence he returned in 1660. 
After Aurangzeb was firmly established on the Delhi throne Khushhd,l, 
however, fell into disgrace and was imprisoned at Rantabhur, but he 
wa'< released after more than two 5^eai's' captivity in 1666, and was 
with Muhammad Amin Khdn, siihahddr of Kdbul, at the great disaster 
which befell the Mughals in the Khaibar in 1672. Disgusted with 
the u age nero us treatment, he received at the hands of the Mughals, 
Kliushhdl did not accord his loyal support to the Mughal cause and his 
opinion of Aurangzeb is set forth in some spirited verses.f The fief of 
Tari BoMq held by the Khataks, appears to have been now granted by 
the Mughals to Sher Muhammad Bangash and this led to a bitter feud 
with the tribes of Bangash, in the course of which Khushh^Pa son 
Ashraf defeated the Kohatis. A second defeat at the Turkai Pass 
followed, § but in 1673 Sher Muhammad Bangash returned from his long 
exile in Hindustan and won over the Sini branch of the Khataks. 
Khushhal Kiid,n thouj^h supported by the Afridis was also hampered 

* Khushhal in his history tries to make out that the Khataks did not join this rebellion 
against the Mughals. 
f He succeede(? his father in 164] . 
J Raverty's Poetry of Afghans, p. 18. 

§ Raveity dates the events, which culminated in the second defeat of the Kohatis at 
the Turkai Pass, back to 1652-54, which appears too early. 



Rhattah history. 529 

by tlie disaffection of the Mushaka, a clan of the Bol^q Khataks, and 
his Afridi allies having attacked Koh^it prematurely were repulsed. 
Kliushhd,l sought refuge in Tird,h and thence wandered into the Yusafzni 
country, but as he lamented in verse, he failed to rouse them against 
the Mughal power, and his son, now nominally chief of the Khataks, 
was sent in charge of a Mughal force against his father's allies— the 
Afridis. Another Mughal defeat was the result, and Khushl)^! was 
enabled to make another attempt on Koh^t, but deserted by the Sinis 
and Miishaks as before he was defeated and wounded in 1675. Two 
years later Ashraf Kh^n was granted Tari-Bolaq as sardar of the tribe, 
and further misunderstanding arose between father and sou. The 
latter waged war on the Malik Miri Bangash and took the fort of 
Poda from theShd/di Khel in 1680. Subsequently the Mughal fan jddrs 
fell out with the Maliks Miri and Ashraf Khd,n, when called upon 
for aid against them, compelled them to surrender Kohdt but protected 
them from Mughal vengeance, and thus enabled his brother Bahidra 
to underminn his influence with the suhahddr of Kabul who treacherous- 
ly seized him when on a visit to Peshdwar and deported him to 
Hiudustdn. 

In 1684 Afzal Khdn, son of Ashraf Khdn and now acting chief of 
the Khataks, was in charge of the road from Khairdbdd to Naushahra, 
but the exactions of the Mughal oflScials, or their legitimate demands 
for revenue, drove him into the Khwarram. He liad also to contend 
with Bahrdm, his uncle, whose authority was acceptable to many of 
the Khataks, but on Khushhdrs death in 1688 Afzal made his peace 
with tlie Mughal authorities and Bahrd,m having lost their favour, he 
again obtained charge of the Naushahra read in 1692. But Afzal failed 
to completely establish his authority till his father's death in 1694 
made him chief of the Khataks, although Bahrdm was still active. 
In 1701 Amir Klid,n, suhahddr ol Kdbul, died and Shd-h Alam moved 
from Multan to secure the vacant province. On his return in 1702-03 
via Bannu and Lakki he marched into the Isa Khel country and 
attempted to reach Peshd,\var by Kd;ld,bd,gh, but was reduced to great 
straits by the Bangi Khel and other 8dghari Khataks until Afzal 
Khan rescued him and escorted him to Lakki. Bahrd,m was sub- 
sequently seized and sent to Kdbul, but he escaped and Afzal Khdn 
was employed to suppress him and another rebel, Ismail Khdn Bangash, 
Afrer Aurangzeb's death Shdh Alam offered Afzal service in Hindu- 
stan but he declined it, as the emperor was unable to leave any 
suhahddr over the Kdbul province, and remained in charge of the 
road from Attock to Peshawar. He also won over Ismail Khdn, while 
Bahrdm sided with Qd,bil Khan, Ismail's rival for the Bangash chief- 
ship. Eventually the latter was acknowled£;ed by all the ulus of 
Bangash and this secured Afzal's position, Saif Khdn his son becom- 
ing /arz/dar of Lachi, which had been the centre of Bahrdm's power. 
Qfibil, however, soon broke out again and the next faujddr of Lachi, 
Nijdbat Khd,n, had to be sent against him. Qabil secured the Mughals' 
aid, but Afzal astutely played off AlUhddd, who held an imperial sanad 
?is faujddr of Bangash, against the suhahddr of Kabul (Ibrahim Khd.n 
a son of AH .Mardd,n Khdn), and the Mughal forces with Qdbil were 
withdrawn in 1708 or 1709. Bahrdm's death followed in 1712 but 
the feuds among the Bangash continued and Afzal's son Said Khdn 



030 Khaitah weddings, 

now faujddr of Ld^chi,* sent ajirga to arbitrate between t"bem, but its 
members were murdered. In revenge lie attacked tbe Bangash and 
defeated them. 

In 1718 Sarbuland Khd,n was appointed suhahddr and sustained a 
defeat by the Afghans in the Khaibar and Afzal took advantage of his 
reverse to refuse to pay peshJcash for Tari-BoMq :ind the Mughals with 
their Bangash vassals had to resort to force to collect it. The suhah' 
ddr also transferred the fief to a brother of Afzal, who retired to 
Chauntra, and subsequently declined an offer of the fief made him by 
thefaujdar of Bangash. In 1723-24 Sarafr^z, a descendant of Shaikh 
Bahddur, Khushbd-l's spiritual guide, raised disturbances in L^chi and the 
( Khwarram, which AsadulMh, Afzal's son and faujddr of Ld,chi, was 
y'^ unable to suppress. Afzal himself had to seek an asylum among the 

j/t Y^sufzais, but in 1 725 he was able with their aid to defeat the fanatical 

mullahs, tdlxhs and darwesh who lost 600 killed, although he had only 
3,000 men and the rebels with their Afridi and other allies number- 
ed 7,000 or 8,000. Here the Khattak chronicles end. 

The chief seats of the Khatak power were Akora, Shdhbdzgarh, 
IC^i'abi'igli an 1 Makhad. The Khat;iks vary in physique and dress. 
Those m ar Upper Mirdnzai resemble tlieir Banjj'ash neighbours, but 
the Barak Khataks are tall, heavily built and stolid with shaggy hair 
cut down to the level of the ear and thick beards a hand-breadth in 
length. Their dress is generally of white cotton, rarely washed, 
and the turban is twisted into a kind of rope. In the fields they 
wear a long shirt, reaching to the ankles, of cotton or wool and 
tied with a bit of rope. Simple but sturdy and independent they are 
very clannish. The Sdgharis of Sliakardarra are tall and spare, accus- 
tomed to a hard active life and so smarter and livelier. In still greater 
contrast to the Baraks are the Khataks of Akora, men of medium height, 
who do not clip the beard, though they shave the head. Thej' are well 
able to hold their own against their Afridi neighbours. Khatak women 
dress in a blue shift with loose trousers, like the Bangash, and generally 
possess few or no ornaments. 

Khatak wedding customs. 

A young fellow who wants to get married sends a dalldl (who may 
be any onej to the parents of the girl to sound them as to the price 
that he will have to pay for her. The dalldl will return with a mes- 
sao-e that the would-be bridegroom must pay Ks. 300 (e, g.) in cash to 
the father as the bride-price : that he must, in addition, find Rs. 40 in 
cash, ten mans of wheat, a couple of sheep, Rs. 60 worth of ornaments, 
one raaund of ghi at the time of the wedding ; and that the hagq mahr 
will be Rs. 200. If the young man can raise the cash down for the 
betrothal, his dihn with the dalldl, and his father or another relation go 
to the house of the girFs fi.ther, who will not, however, appear himself 
but will work through his dum and his muhhtdr. The money will be 
counted out on to the chitdi to the girl's dum who will give it to the 
girl's mother. The two dalldls will then go throuyfh what these 



* Sadr Kh4n had been /aw/ddr of Ldchi, on the part of Bahram. The date of Said 
Khan's appointment it not known. 



The Kohifc Khattak custonia arc. a 
little different. The bridal party arrives 
at the girl's village in the evening, and is 
opposed with clods. A rope is stretched 
across the road at the height of a man, and 
this must be broken down either by a man 
on a pony or by tying a stone in a pagri 
and tbirewith palling it down. There 
is no seven-coloured string game, and the 
boy himself drips wa(er from a sword 
thrice^ into a gJiara. The nikah take place' 
■early in the morning at the girVs house. 



Khattak'jweddings. 63 1 






Bannuchis call the sharai nikdh, i. e., {ho'ijab-qdbul, on behalf of their 
clients. Menhdi is applied to the hands of all present with the intima- 
tion that so-and-so's daughter is betrothed to so-and-so. 

Neither betrothals nor marriages take place between the two Ids. 
Betrofhals take place in Ramzan but few marriages. This is ou ac- 
count of the fast more than anything else. 

When the girl reaches puberty; if she has not already reached it, and 
the bridegroom can raise the value of the ornaments, etc., and the grain 
and ghi which are sent to the girl's people for the wedding banquet, 
he sends his ^urn to ask if the other side is ready. On the date fixed 
at about 8 or 9 p. m. he, with the males and females of his. village and 
from among his relations, starts to the house of the girl. The men of 
the girl's village turn out to oppose them, by throwing clods, for some 
time, but at last desist. Among the Wazirs, especially in former times, 
swords were brandished and injury occasionally caused. However the 
boy's party enters the village, and the boy and the men go to the 
chauk, while the women go to the girl's house and sing love songs, 
coming out after a while and singing to the boy to join them. He 
then goes with a party of his men into the girl's courtyard and stands 
in the middle while 8 or 9 men lift him in the air three times, he rais- 
ing his hands to show how tall he is. The girl's dmn intertwines seven 
strings of different colours, each the height of the boy, and as the boy 
is lifted up the diim jumps in the air swinging the cord so as to raise it 
above the boy's head if he can in order to show that the girl's family is 
superior. Then the boy is made to stand on a 7'ezdi against the wall, 
while five or six men of his party stand on each end of the rezdi. The 
women of his party gather together at one end of the rezdi and the 
women of the girl's party at the other. Then the women of each party 
sing love songs and al)use each other for several hours, while the boy 
who keeps quiet, stands with his mouth covered with the end of his 
turban. Just before dawn a female relative of the girl places patdsas in 
the middle of the rezdi and these ajre distributed. Then a younger 
sister or some other young relation of the girl comes out of the house in 
which the bride is, and her sheet and the hoy's patkd are tied together 
by the bride's dum. She holds the knot firm. The women of the boy's 
party then leave the courtyard and go to the nearest water in which 
one of the husband's family dips the blade of a sword letting the ua'er 
drip into a ghara. This is repeated thrice and then the ghara is fii.ed 
up in the ordinary manner. Then they return to the house and the 
water is sprinkled in the room where the girl is. The mother of the 
girl then brings curds and forces the boy to take two mouthfuls after 
which the boy gives the bride's sister a rupee to untie the knot. 

The mother of the girl then presents a bed, pillow and sheet, and 
puts on her the ornaments that have been bought after they have be en 
weighed in the presonce of all by a goldsmith. The girl is then put on 
a pony with the boy's dum and the boy's party sets out none of the 
girl's family going with thena. On this day the village is feasted by 
the boy and the girl remains for the night with his women folk. The 
wedding by the nnilldh takes place the next night and then the pair 
are left alone. The next morning, however, the girl's 4um takes her 
back to her parents with whom she remains a week or so aftel' which

she sends lier dim to say she wants to be fetched. She is taken to the 
boy's home by dum. 1'he dum is throughout an important person and 
is fed on all occasions. 
Khattae, KathaEj Kahtar, a tribe of the Attock district. The Khattars 
claim kinship with the Awd-ns, and to be, Hke them and the western 
Khokhars, descended from one of the sons of Qutb Sbdh Qureshi, 
of Ghazni. But the Awans do not alwa} s admit the relationship, 
and the Khattars' are said often to claim Edjput origin. Mr. E. B. 
Steedman, however, accepted their Aw^n origin, and says that an 
Awd-n admits it, but looks upon the Khattars as an inferior section 
of the tribe to whom he will not give his daughters in marriage. 
Sir Lepel Griffin, who relates the history of the principal Khattar 
families at pp. 561 — 9 of his Panjcib Chiefs, thought that they 
were originally inhabitants of Khorasan who came to India with 
the early Muhammadan invaders. But Colonel Cracroit noted that the 
Khattars of Hdwalpindi still retain marriage customs which point to an 
Indian origin ; and they themselves have a tradition of having been 
driven out of their territory on the Indus near Attock into Afghdnistdn, 
and returning thence with the armies of Muhammad of Ghoi'i.* Sir 
Alexander Cunningham, on the other hand, would identify them with 
a branch of the Kator, Cidaritse, or Little Yuchi, from whom the Gujars 
also are descended. [Archssological Survey Reports, II, p. 80). They 
now hold the tract, known as the Khattar from their name, which ex- 
tends on both sides of the Kdla Chitta Pahd,r from the Indus to the 
boundary of the Rawalpindi tahsil, and from Usmd,n Katar on the north 
to the Khairi-Murat hills on the south, and which they are said to 
have taken from Gujars and Awd,ns. Raverty says that their seats of 
authority were Bhatiut or Bhatot and Nilab on the Indus. They still 
hold the latter place which used to be called Takht-i-NiUb or 'the Throne 
of the Blue Water' — the Indus. The Khattars sided with the Mughals 
against the Khataks, bub although their chief Ghairat had been ap- 
pointed /awjcZar of Attock, they met with more than one reverse at the 
hands of Khushhal Kh^n and Afzal Kh^n, the Khatak chiefs in 1673 
and 1718. Colonel Cracrott wrote :" The Khattars enjoy an unenvi- 
able notoriety in regard to crime. Their tract has always been one 
in which heavy crime has flourished ; they are bad agriculturists, ex- 
travagant iti their habits, keep hawks and horses, and are often back- 
ward in paying their revenue. They do not allow their daughters to 
inherit excepting in cases of intermarriage Avith members of the 
family, and even then only for some special reason." On this Mr. 
Steedman noted : " Since then they have become more civilised and less 
addicted to deeds of violence. Socially the Khattars hold an inter- 
mediate place, ranking below Gakkhars, Awans, Ghebas, Jodras, and 
other high class Rdjputs." 

Mr. T. P. Ellis wrote an interesting account of the tribe which merits 
reproduction here both for itself and because it illustrates the ex- 



* Ace ording to the Rawalpindi Gazetteer of 1883-84 the Khattars claim descent from 
Chohan, youngest son of Qutb Shah, who established himself on the Indus where for many 
years the tribe maintained its position. It was at least driven out by a Hindu tribe under 
Raj Deo, in 1175, but its chief, Khattar Khan, returning with Muhammad of Ghor, recaptured 
Nilab and, taking its name from him, the tribe overran the open country between thfl Indug 
and the Rawalpindi, dispossessing the Awans and Gujars. 



Ehattar septs, 533 

traordinary divergencies of tradition as to the origin of tiibes of no 
great antiquity. 

The Khattars are generally credited with a Hindu origin, from 
Khatris * but they are themselves divided in belief as to their descent. 
Some admit the Hindu origin, while those who deny it claim an Arab 
descent, alleging they are closely connected with the Awd,ns. They claim 
3 founders, Hd-shim, AbduUa and Mustafa, and say that in the time of 
Harun-ur-Rashid they came to Baghdad, and that in his jihod thev 
reached Hindustd,n -yia Baluchistdn m which latter country there are 
said to be 9,000 Khattar SaMna (houses or graves). They allege 
that they joined later in the raids of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi who 
settled them in Bagh Nildb whence they spread over the rocky barren 
country of the Kd,ld Chitta range in Attock, Pindigheb and Fattehjano- 
tahsils. ^ 

In order to meet to the generally arcepted belief that they were rrigin- 
ally Hindus, even those who claim a Mussalman origin admit that 
while at Bd,gh Nild,b they became Hindus and were reconverted. 

The Khattars are sometimes divided into two main branches, thouo-h 
theyt themselves rarely speak of them. These are how the K^la 
Khattars and the Chitta Khattars. To the former belongs the Dhrek 
family, to the latter the Wdh faraily, though they are closely connected 
by intermarriage. It is possible that in this division lies the true expla- 
nation of the conflicting stories as to origin, the former who are darkish 
in colour being converted Hindus, and the latter of true Mussalman 
descent overpowering and absorbing their predecessors. 

The origin of the name Khattar is ascribed by those who claim an 
Arab descent to a mythical Khattar Khan, the Tvord Khattar being 
synonymous with the word zahr. 

Sub-divisions. 
Khattar Khd,ni3 supposed to have had seven descendants, who like the 
Gakkhars and many others founded as many septs with the patronymic 
'dl. These were Firozal, Sirhd,!, Isdl, Garhdl, Balwdl, Mittidl and 
Kharidl.J The Khattars generally intermarry, indeed Cracroft attri- 
buted the degeneracy of the Dhrek family to ciofee intermarriage carried 
on for several generations. The Wah Jamily has also taken to it of 
recent times, Awdns both take from and give wives to Khattars, but 
Pathans, Gakkhars and Sayyids will not give them brides. Very 
strict yardah is maintained. Khattar wedding rites used to closely re- 
semble those of Hindus, Brahcnans even being present, but they are 
now solemnised according to strict Mahammadan rules. Till recently 
Khattars were not allowed to eat the hare. The Khattars have a tribal 
shrine that of Shah Abdul Wahab at Barot where both Khattars and 
Ghnkkai-s used to send the bodies of their dead for interment. A stone 
near Bagh Nilab was formerly regarded as the shrine of Nuri Shdb 



* But the t is soft in Khalri and hard in Khattar. The identification with Kator is 
equally untenable, as Mr. W. Irvine has shown in J . R. A. S., 1911, p. 218. 

t It is possible that these names are territoiial and derived from the Kal4 Chitta Range. 

J Other septs are the Jandal and Ranial, the former giving its name to the tract south 
of the Kala Chitta.

entirely. The only notable superstition is that if rain fails the women 
of the village collect togethsr and fill gharas with water just outside 
the village. The village Khan is sent for and he takes hold of the 
plough^ and thereupon the women throw the gharas of water over him.

KsEEA, a Jd,t (agricultural) tribe found in Kabirwdla tahsil, Multd,n district, 
whither they migrated from the Lakki ]ungle in 
the 13th century. It is also found in Ludhiana and 
Amritsar. It wives the marginal pedigree and thus 
claims Solar Rajput origin. Its home was Mathra- 
na^ari on the Jumna, whence they migrated to 
Takhar-wind in the Malwa. An attempt to settle 
in Khadur was foiled by the Kan^, but eventually 
the latter tribe was defeated and the Khera settled 
in their present villages in Amritsar. Khera was 
the son of a Sidhu Jdt's daughter and treated his 
relations-in-law harshly — whence the name Khera 
fr. kharwa, ' bitter.'

Khetran a tribe settled in the Loralai District of Balochistan at the back of 
the Laghari, Khosa, and Lund country. Their original settlement was 
at Vahoa in the country of the Kasrdni of Dera Ismail Kh^-i, where 
many of them still live and hold land between the Kasrd^ni Baloch 
(with whom they have long been at feud) and the river. But the 
emperor Akbar drove out the main body of the tribe, and they took re- 
fuge in the Barkhan valley which is still held by the Ndhar sept of the 
Khetrans as inferior proprietors, the Lagh^iris being its superior own- 
ers. They are ci^rtainly not pure Baloch, and are held by many to be 
Pathans, descended from Mi^na, brother of Tarin, the ancestor of tho 
Abdalij and they do in some cases intermarry with Pathans. Bat 
they confessedly i esemble the Baloch in features, habits, and general 
appearance, the names of their septs end in the Baloch patronymic 
termination dni and they are now for all practical purposes a Baloch

tribe. It is probable that they are in reality a remnant of the original 
Jdt population ; they speak a dialecb of their own called Khetr^ni 
which is an Indi&.n dialect closely allied with Sindlii, and in fact 
probably a form of the Jatki speech of the lower Indus. I'hey are 
the least warlike of all the Baloch tribes, capit il culfivators, and in 
consequence very well-to-do. Their lands are generally divided into 
lar^re blocks held by numerous sharers, eacli proprietor holding 
shares in many such blocks scattered about, in different viliaores. The 
tribe, as it now stands, is composed of four clans, of which the 
Ganjura represents the original Khetr^n nucleus, while to them aro 
affiliated the Dhariwal"^ or Ohacha vvho say that they are Dodai BalocH, 
the Hasani, once an important Baloch tribe which was crushed Vjy 
N^sir Khan, ilie great Kh^n of Kelat, and took refuge with the 
Khetrdn of whom they are now almost independent, and the Nflhap 
or Babar, who are by origin Lodi Pathans. Th» name, as Dames 
observes, is undoubtedly derived from kheti' ' field.' 

Khewa, a boatman. 

Khichar, a sept of Jd^s in Jind ; see under Jaria. 

Khichi, Khichchi, a Muhammadan tribe of Jat status, found as a compact 
tribe almost exclusively round Mailsi in Multan and in the northern part 
of Gugera tahsil, Montgomery district.f It claims Chauh^n origin and 
descent from one Khichi Kh^n, a ruler in Ajmer. Driven out of 
Delhi by the Muhammadans his descendants Sisan and Vadar mig- 
rated to Multdn. The Khichis fought with the Joiya;^, then para- 
mount in those parts, and aiso say that they were sent against the 
rebellious Baloch of Kh^i by the Mnghals, in Multdn; In Montgomery 
the Khichis say they were converted to I^liim by Bah^wal Haqq, 
wandered up the Il^vi,t abandoned agriculture for cattle-breeding and 
joined the Kharrals in robbery, but under the rule of Kamr Singh 
Nakkdi resumed cultivation and are now industrious peasants.

Khidezai, a section of the Razzar Mandaur Pat;hd.ns, in Peshd,war. 

Khilchi, a J^t clan (agricultural) found in Sh^hpur : see Khilji. 

* Dhariwal is the name of an important Jat tribe, _ Mr. Bray says that in Balochistan 
three clans are recognised, viz., — Ispani, Palliat, Dhirewal or more correctly Dhara. The 
term Ganj-dra is occasionally applied to the first two clans, or even to the whole tuman 
(tribe). The Hasani and Chacha are merely septs affiliated to the Dhara, while the Nahar 
(? hyaenas) are a sept of the Ispani. Folk etymology derives Dhirewal from dhtrwdl, a 
shepherd, and dhara is said to mean ' heap.' 

t They are thus found along the lower and middle Sutlej, and on the Ravi from Multan 
to Lahore, but there are also a few of them on the Chenab, ani the'-e are considerable 
numbers of them in the Delhi district where they appear to be recognised as a sept of the 
Chauhan. In Shahpur they are also found and in _ that District they are classed as Jat 
(agricultural), but in Montgomery they are classed as Rajputs. In the Chenab Colony most 
of them returned themselves as Rajputs, but some as Jats. In the Sandal Bar they were 
dependents of the Kharrals, although superior to them in status taking wives from them, 
but refusing to give them brides. They were, however, not counted as 'belonging to the 
' great Ravi ' tribes, and it is possible that the Khichi of the Bar and in Shahpur are really 
Khilchi or Khilji, not the Chauhan Khichi of Multan.

Khilji, a Mughal clan (agricultural) found in Amritsar. It appears to be 
quite distinct from the Khichi, and is probably the representative of 
tlie Khalj. 

Khira, a tribe of Jjlts found in the Pasrur and Daska tahsils of Sidlkot. 
Khira was a son of Sanpdl. Like the Ghummans they are Bajwa 
Rajputs by descent. 

Khiwa, a clan with some pretensions to Rd^jput origin, and locally ranking 
somewhat above the J^ts, found in Jhelum. Like the Bharat and 
Kallas it gives bride to the Jalap. The Khiwa are also found in 
Shdhpur as an agricultural clan. 

KuiZR Khel, (1) a clan of the Soni or Suni Sarwarni Path^ns, according 
to Raverty. Settled in the Khiiibar in Bdbar's time, they weie attack- 
ed by him and driven into the mountains in 1519. They hail molested 
him on his march over the psiss, and in 1507 had opposed his advance 
through it with the Shama Kliel, Kharlakhi and Khogiani. This clan 
appears to be extinct, absorbed or now divided into septs, the name 
being forgotten or disused : (2) a minor fraction of the Mintar Khel, 
Muhammad Khel, Hassan Khel, Mohmit Khel, Utmanzai Darwesh 
Khel of the Wazirs.* See under Khidr Khel. 

Khizrzai a section of the Natozai, Dumar, Sanzar Kakar Path^ns. 

Kho a term applied to the inhabitants of Turikho and Muikho, or Upper 
and Lower Kho, in Chitrd,!. The Kho appear to be a mixed race and 
comprise families descended from Radakhshis, Shighnis, VVaUhis and 
Gilo-itis. Nevertheless they appear to give their name to Khow^r 
or Chitrd,li, the language of the great mass of the people in the country 
drained by the Clntr^l river and its affluents, as far down as Mirkhanni, 
as well aa in the Ghi^ar valley above Pingal. It includes many loan 
words from Persian, Pashtu and Urdu. 

Khod, a Muhammadan clan (agricultural) found in Montgomery. 

Khogiani Khugiani, a tribe of the Karldr.i Pathans which at one time 
occupied the whole of Khost, but is now found in Kurram. The name 
has fallen into disuse except in Peshawar, where a few Pathdns of this 
name are found. Both the Jaji and the Turi of Kunam claim to 
be descendants of Khugidni, S(m of Kakai, but their Pathttn origin is 
open to doubt. 

Khoja fern. -i. — The word Khoja is really nothing more than our old friend 
the Khwdja of the Arabian Nights, and means simply a man of wealth 
and respectability. In the Punjab it is used in three different senses; 
for a eunuchjt for a scavenger converted to Islam, and for a Muham- 
madan trader.J It is only in the last sense that the Khojas can be 

* A Dictionary of the Pathdn Tribes, 1899, p. 109. 

t Khoja also means bald. For the eunuchs see under Hijrl For Khwaja as a title see 
uuder Khwaja. As a title Khoja appears to be used only by or of Khojas by caste. 

t The Khojas of Bombay are well known for their wealth and commercial enterprise, but 
they do not appear to have any connection, as a caste, with those of the Punjab. Dissent 
from orthodox Muhammadanism is however everywhere well marked among the Khojas, who 
are thus described in Burton's History of Sindh, pp. 2'J8-li'49. 

" The Khwaj-eh (or as the word is generally pronounced Khwajo and Khojo) is a small 
tribe of strangers settled in Sindh, principally at Karachi, where there may be about three 
hundred families.

called a ' casto/ but there does nol; appear to be any true caste of 
KhojaSj any Hindu trader converted to Iskim being known by that 
name. Thus the Khojas of Shahpur are almost entirely Khatris, and 
a Khatri now becoming a Musalman in that District would be called a 
Khoja. The Khojas of Jhaiig, on the other hand, are said to be con- 
verted Aroras ; while some at least of the Lahore Khojas claim Bhd,tia 
origin, and one section of the Ambdla Khojas are K^yaths. But in the 
north-west I^unjab and the northern districts of the North-Wesj 
Frontier Province, the term Paracha is preferred by Hindu traders con- 
verted to Islam, so that where the Pard,chas are a recognised and 
wealthy caste, khoja is used for miscellaneous Muhammadan traders, 
chieflj' hawkers and pedlars, or at least petty traders ; while in the 
eastern districts and in the Derajat, where the Khojas are commercially 
important^ paracha is used for the Muhammadan pedlar. 

These Muhammadan traders, whether called Khoja or Paracha, are 
found all along the northern portion of the two Provinces under the 
hills from Amritsar to Peshd,war, and have spread southwards into the 
central and eastern districts of the Western Plains, but have not entered 
the Derajat or Muzaffargarh in any numbers. Their eastern boundary 
is the Sutlej valley, their western the Jhelum-Chenab, and they are 
found throughout the whole of the Salt Range. Probably it is hardly 
correct to say of them that they have " spread" or " entered/' for they 
apparently include many distinct classes who will have sprung from 
different centres of conversion. They appear to be most numerous in 
Lahore. An interesting account of a trade development by the Khojas 
of Gujrdt and Sialkot is given in Punjab Government Home Proceed- 
ings No. 10 of March 1879. It appears that these men buy cotton 
piece-goods in Delhi and hawk them about the villages of their own 
Districts, selling on credit till harvest time, and the business has now 
assumed very large proportions. The Khojas of the Jhang district 
were thus described by Mr. Monckton : " They do not cultivate with 
their own hands, bat own a great many wells and carry on trade to a 
considerable extent. They are supposed to have been converted 
from Hinduism. They do not practise cattle-stealing, but are a liti- 
gious race, and addicted to fraud and forgery in the prosecution of 
their claims." 

In spite of their conversion to IsUm, the Khojas retain many traces 
of the Khatri caste organization. Thus at Bhera in Shdhpur they hava 



the following sub-divisions : — 



1. Sahgal. 

2. Wohra or Bohra. 

3. Sethi. 



4. Kapur. j 7. Gorawala. 

5. Duggal. 8. Magua. 

6. Rawar or Ror. | 9. Mehndru. 



" Their own account of their origin is that they emigrated from Persia. Probably they 
fled the country when the Ismailiyeh heresy (to which they still cleave) was so severely 
threatened by Ilolaku Khan. They differ from the Ismailites in one essential point, viz., 
whereas that race believes in only seven Imams, the Khwajehs continue the line down to 
the present day. They are therefore heterodox Shiahs, as they reject Abubakr, Umar, 
and Usman, Muhammed Bakir and Imam Jafar-i-Sadik. In Sindh they have no mosques, 
but worship in a kano or house prepared for that purpose. For marriages and funerals 
they go to the Sunni Kazi's, but their Mukhi or head priest at Karachi settles all their 
religious and civil disputes. Under the Mukhi, who is changed periodically, are several 
officers called Waris, and under these again are others termed Khamriya."

— all Khatri sections. A tenth, Matoli, does not appear to be a Khatri 
section, but it ranks with, the first six, and from these seven the last 
three cannot obtain wives, tiioug-h they give brides to them. The 
Khojas of Bhera* claim to be strictly monogamous, so much so that, as a 
rule, a Khoja caunot obtaiu a secoud wife in the caste, even though 
his first have died and he is thus driven to take his second wife from 
some other Muhammadan tribe. The Khojas of Leiah have the Khatri 
section-names of Kapur, Ptiri, Tandan and Gambhir, but as these are 
no longer exogamous and as wives may be taken from other castes, the 
old rules of hypergamy and endogamy are no longer in force. 

Ihe Khojas of Jhang have at least four clans, Magun, Wohra, 
Wadawana and Passija. The last named is undoubtedly of Arora 
oiigin. At Chiniot in Jhang the Khojas are mainly Khatris, recruited 
by some Arora sections, thus : —

The original Khatri classification into Biiri and Bunjahi groups is said 
to be still presei'ved. Formerly the Khatri sections used not to inter- 
marry witli the Aroras, but this restriction is said to be no longer ab- 
solute, though such marriages are not usual. The Khojas in Chiniot 
reverence Fir Gilani, the descendaut of Imam Hassan, and his descend- 
ants live in Kotia, Gujranwala district. The Khojas have a cemetery 
of their own at Chiniot, called the Hcifiz Diwan. 

The Wohra are possibly the same as the Boraf of Centra) India. In 
Central India they have a remarkable colony at Ujjain, which is divided 
into lour mahdls under elected Mullahs. Malcolm J says they belong 
to the Hassani sect and are a progressive community. The Khojas of 
Makhad (a place on the Indus) are more usually called Parachas. They 
have houses of a peculiar structure — in fact, the Khojas' enterprise 
seems to be as marked as their high standard of comfort, and in this 
they are somewhat different to the Khatris.

had two grades, one superior and genuine, the other comprising ]3 in- 
ferior septs who were ivazirs of the Sammas. To these latter belonged 
the Khohdnra. 

* The Khojas of Bhera have a legend that they were expelled from Chak Sano, a 
ruined village in Bhera tahsil, some two or three centuries ago. They have an extensive 
trade with Kabul and beyond, and inhabit a remarkably well-built mchallu in Bhera, tvhere

The Khokhars, 639; 

Khokhae, -UR.— (1) a tribe, found among Jc4tg, Rdjputs, Ardins* an(3 Cliuhrds 
{see infra). As a tribe of varying Rcljput and . Tat status the Khokliars 
are most numerous along the valleys oi the Jhelum and Clienab, and 
especially in the Jhang and Shdhpur districts. They are also found, 
though in smaller numbers, on the lower Indus and the Sutlej, espe- 
cially in Lahore, and also all along the foot of the hills from the Jhelum 
to the Sutlej. Pind Dddan Khdn m the Jhelum is said to have been 
refounded by a Hada Rajput from Garh Chitor, named Fateh Chand, 
who en conversion to Islam was re-named Dadan Khdn.t He was Rdja 
of those parts in the time of Jahanglr, but the Khokh,.rs had held the 
tract at an earlier period for they are mentioned as its occupiers in the 
Ain-i-Ahhari. They also once ruled an extensive tract in Jhang 'lyino* 
east of the Jhelum. The Khokhars of Gujrafc and Sidlkot have a tradi- 
tion that they were originally settled at Garh Karana, which they can- 
not identify, J but were ejected by Timur and they went to Jammu, 
whence they spread silong the hills, and the concentration oi the 
Khokhars of the plains on the Jhelum and ChendH, and their wide 
diffusion in the sub-montane tract are explained by the history of 
Timur's invasion. In Akbar's time they were shown ns the principal 
tribe of the Dasuya ^)a7'^a«a (in Hoshidrpur) and they now give their 
name to the Khokharain, a tract which contains some 40 Kliokhar 
villages, all but three of which are in Kapurthala State on the bordeis 
of Dasuya tahsil,§ In Kapurthala the Khokhars have four eponymous 
septs, Sajriii, Kdlti, Ber and Jaich. In Shahpur the Khokhars are said 
to be split up into nunierous septs, amono^ which are the Nissowana. 
The Bhatti and Kudhan are septs found in Montgomery. 

The origins of the Khokhnrs are as obscure as those of any Punjab 
tribe. 'J'radition appears invariably to cminect them with the Awdns, 
making Khokhar one of Qutb Rhdli's sons and the Khokhar Qutb Shaliis 
his descendants, who would thus be akin to the Juoans also. But this 
pedigree probably merely records the fact that the Awansand Khokhars 
owe their conversion to Isldm to the saint Qutb Shah or his disciples, or 
that they both accepted his teach ings.|| However this may be the 
Khokhars in Sidlkot inter many with otlier tribes, which the A wdns will 
not do, and thus in a sense rank below them. In Gujidt, where they 
hold a compact block of villagres about Mung on the Jhelum and own 
some of the richest lands in the District, tlie leading Khokhars are called 
Rdjd, as being of Rajput status or descent ' from Bharat and Jas'^at.' 
Yet they claim kinship with the Awans and inteimarry witli them and 
the Bhattis, giving wives to the Chibbs, but not getting bi'ides in re- 
. turn.^ Moreover the Khokhar themselves vary in status. In the east

X Kirana Hill in Jhang cannot well be meant. 

§ There are two Khokhar chhatt or leading villages in the Kholdiarain, Tahli in 
Hoshiarpur and Begowal in Kapurthala. 

II That the Khokhars were originally Hindus appears hardly open to question. The 
Khokhars in Jhelum say they used to keep up certain Hindu customs, and had puroltita. who 
were Datts, until recent times, but that this is no longer the case. Thoj'- do not know 
whether they are connected with other Khokhars of the Punjab 

1j At births, weddings, etc., they observe Ji'it usages, but have no ralhdclnlri like them 
and no dur like the Gujars. Before the wedding procession starts presents are given 
to 7 Jcamlns. — a N.ai, Mirasi, Tarkhsin, Lobar, Kiinihar, Dhoba and RaCi) or Hindu. And 
when the procession reaches the bride's house her father brings as many presents in a

S40 RhoJchar traditions. 

of the Punjab they marry, on more or less equal terms, with other Bdj- 
puts and so rank as a Rajput tribe. But in Jullundur they are said to 
intermarry in their own tribe or with Shaikhs, Aw^ns and the like, 
rather than with their Eajput neighbours. About Pind Dadan Khd,n 
the Rajput Khokhars are sail to be entirely distinct from the Jd,t 
Khokhars, though elsewhere in Jhelum the tribe has for the most part 
become merged with the ' J^t ' cultivators. Those of Ed,jput status, 
however, marry into some of the best Janjua families. In Bahawalpur 
the Khokhars are found in some numbers and many of them return their 
main tribe as Bhatti. They intermarry among themselves, but some- 
times give brides to Joiyas. One well-known sept is called Missan, so 
called because they once gave a mirdsi a loaf made of missi (gram 
flour) and in revenge he satirised them. 

In an article entitled A History of the Gakkhars, contributed to the 
Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1871, by Mr. J. G. Delmerick, 
the Khokhars of the Muhammadan historians were taken to be the 
Gakkhars. Tiie late Major Raverty, however, expressed a strong opin- 
ion that the writer of the article had confused the Gakkhars with the 
Khokhars, a totally distinct tribe, and a full examination of all the evi- 
dence at present readily accessible, has convinced the present writer of 
the correctness of Major Raverty 's position. The Khokhars were set- 
tled in the Punjab centuries before the Gakkhars, and were early spread 
all over the central Districts of the Province before the Gakkhars ac- 
quired their seats in the Salt Range, to which they are and always have 
been confined. If this thesis be correct, it follows that Farishta's de- 
scription of the customs of polyandry and female infanticide, as practised 
by the tribe, apply not to the Gakkhars at all, but to the essentially 
Punjab tribe, the Khokhars. 

The traditional history of the Khokhars* 

Beor^sahs^,t who succeeded Jamshid, King of Persia, was called 
Daliak or the ' Ten Calamities.' On his shoulders were two snake-like 
tumours, -whence he was nick-named Maran or Aydah^ by the Persians, 
and called Dabak (or Zuhd,k)t Mard,a, while his descendants were de- 
signated Tak§-bansi, Nag-bansi or Takshak. About 1500 B. C. Kama, 
the iroDsmith, aided Faridun, a descendant of Jamshid, to subdue 
Dahak, who was cast into the well of Koli Damavind, and Faridun be- 
came King of Persia. One of Dahak's descendants, named Bustam 
Raja, surnamed Kokrd, was governor of the Punjab and had his capital 
at Kokrand., on a hill in the Chinhath Do^b, but it is now called Koh 
Kird^n^.j] At the same time Mihr^b, also a descendant of Zuhdk, held 
Kabul as a feudatory of Faridun.

X Zuhak is merely the Arabicised form of Dahak. Zuhaka was another name for Zahal, 
the aacient fortified city, identified by Raverty with the Maidan-i-Rustam Koh, visited by 
Babar. It was Rustam's appanage and lies on the sources of the Tochi and the Zurmat 
rivers.

Khohhar traditions. 541 

After acquiring the Persian throne, Fariclun marched against Dahdk's 
descendants. Bust^m fled and sought refuge in the Hill of Ghor, west 
of Kandahdr, where liis people ruled for generations, being called'Ghori 
or Ghoria and all being pagans. 

Some years later Bustd,m was murdered and some powerful R^jil took 
possession of the Sindh-S%ar Dodb, where Alexander found Takshail 
(Taxiles), founder of Takshala (Taxila), now Dlieri Shdhdn in the Attock 
district. But before the Macedonian invasion Kaid R^j, Kino- of 
Miirw^r, overran the Punjab in the reign of Darius Hystaspes, toon 
after Bust^m's murder. His capital was Bherd. on the Jhelum district 
and he also founded a fort at Jammu, which he entrusted to Virk* 
Khokhar, one of his kinsmen. Virk, with his own tribesmen, conquered 
the northern hills, and then, in league with the hillmen of Kohdt and 
the Sulaimd,n Hills, drove Kaid Rdj out of the Punjab. The Khokhars, 
under such chiefs as Jot, Salb^han, 1^,1, Bal, Sirkap, Sirsuk, Vikrara, 
Hodi, Sandd,, Askap, Kliokhar (sic), Badal and Kob, thenceforward held 
the Punjab. 

A long period after this, Bahr^m, R^ja of Ghor, left Shordb, which 
lay 100 miles from Qandahd.r,t and, regaining the Kokrand, terrifory, 
his hereditary province, he founded Shordb to the east of the Kokriimi, 
Hill. Another Rajd, of Ghor, named Zamin Dd,war, founded yet another 
city 3 Jios to the east of Shor^b and called it Dd,war, and this was laid 
waste by the Tartars, but the mound still exists. To the west of it lies 
the new town of Dawar, which is still in possession of the tribe. Shorab 
was destroyed by Sultdn Mahmud, and its rains stand at the foot of the 
present Shorabwdli Pahari Hill. 

Gori^, the Kokrana Rd,ja of Shar^b, was succeeded by his two sons 
Bd-dalJ and Bharth§ and 11 others who were sons of handmaids. Bd,dal 
succeeded to the upland tracts of Chiniot and Kokrd,nd,,|| while Bharth 
took those east of the Chend,b. The latter, who dwelt in Bharth, a 
city named after himself, which lay 6 kos west of Nankdn^ village, 
came, stone in hand, to aid his brother Bd,dal Khan in battle ; but learn- 
ing that he had already fallen, he placed the stone on the ground and 
marched to avenge his loss. He was, however, worsted in the conflict, 
and Bharth, his city, destroyed. But the stone still lies on the hill. 
South of Chiniot B^dal founded Mdri Tappd, on a hill still so called. 

* This is to account for the existence of the Virk, a powerful Jat tribe, still numerous in 
Gujranwala. It also seems to connect them with the Khokhars. 

t Eight or ten miles west of Qandahar lies the village of Khokharan. The kaliis of the 
bards record a Raja named Kokra of Garh Kokrand, now called Kadyana. 

J Badal would appear to be a Hindu name ; cf, Rai Badal of Chittor : but lower down we 
find him called Badal Khan, the latter a Muhammadan title. It is curious to find Hindu 
and Muhammadan names mixed up in this history without apparent sense of incongruity. 
Thus below we have Ratn Pil, undoubtedly a Hindu, descended from Sanda, whose three 
brothers all bore Muhammadan names, even if Sanda was himself a Hindu. Among the 
Meos of Gurgaon the position at the present time is precisely the same and the present head 
of the Muhammadan Kharrals in the Lyallpur district is called Jagdeo. 

§ The name Bharth frequently occurs in Punjab legends as the name of the ancestor of a 
tribe, or even as a sept name. 

II It is unsafe to identify places like Kokran4 with the Khokhars. Near Rohtak are the 
mounds called Khokra Kot, under which lie ancient cities, but the word Khokra has no 
connection with the Khokhar tribe. (See Rohtak gazetteer, 1883-4, p. 16.)

In the middle of the Chenab he commenced a stone fort and a masonry 
bridge wliich he never completed, but a wall of the fort, called the 
Badalgarh, still remains. With Dara, his beloved kinsman, Rdja Badal 
Khd^n {f.ic) was assassinated on his way to Maii Tappa, some 3 Jcos from 
Ohiniot, and here his tomb, called Badal Dd-rd, still stands to the west 
of the village of Amirpur. 

Bharth's territory had extended as far as Gujr^t, and he left 8 sons 
of whom 4 left issue. These were Sdndd,, Hassan, Husain and Mahmud. 
Sandd, built a city, Sandar, between the Ravi and the Dek streams, the 
ruins of which are still called Siindar-kd,-tibba in the (Pindi) Bhattid,n 
tract. He ruled so justly that his dominion is still called the Sdudar or 
Sd,ndal Bdr.* He left 4 sons, Manddr, Ratn Ptll, Bald,, and Jdl. From 
Hatn Pdl sprang the Rilii4n,t a sepb which has two branches, the Nisso- 
wandSjJ and the Bhikhas,§ found m Shdhpar and Jhang. Kdlowdl waa 
head-quarters of this sept. Sultan Mandtir's descendants are now found 
in Bannu, where they trace their origin to Kais Abdur-Rashid, and are 
thus called Mandar (sic) Afghdns. Mandd,r himself prospered, kept in 
with the ruler of Kdbul and conquered the Kohistan-i-Namak and the 
Koh-i-Nandana. Of his twelve sons, three were legitimate, and of 
those three Rai Singin remained in the Koliistan-i-Namak and married 
his daughter to Sultdn Jalal-ud-Din Khwdrizmi, who made his son 
general of his own forces, with the title of Qutlugh-Khani. The secon i 
son Ichhar founded Ichhrd, near Lahore, and the third was Md,chhi 
Khan, who became Rdja of Chiniot, which was named from Chandan, 
his sister, who built a palace on the hill as a hunting lodge for her 
lather. Mari Tappa was not then populated, but Andheri was flourish- 
ing, and north of it lay the dhaidar,\\ or abode of Rdni Chandan, which 
was called Chandniot, now Chiniot. When Andheri was deserted, 
Machhi Khan^ shifted his residence to the eastern bank of the river. 
Rai Singin had four sons ; Sarpal, Hast,*'^ Vir and Dadan. Some of 
Sarpdl's sons went to Afghanistan and now trace their descent to Shdh 

* But a local legend, recorded by Mr. E. D. Maclagan, says this Bar is so named after 
one Sandal, a Cluihra, who used to commit great depredations. Another Chuhr^ used to 
live in the Gua rock, i. e., the rock wilh the ' cavern,' and eat men. The people sometimes 
called the Bar, Tattar, i.e., ' the Desert.'

Husain Ghori. Chuchak or Achu was sixth and Malik Shaikh seventh 
in descent from Sarpal, and the latter founded Shaiklui, a fort, and 
Dhankar, a villag-e in the hill of Bhavvtin,-^ north of Mancrlan, he and his 
father holding the hill-country and the tracts west of Gujrdt. Malik 
Shaikha was appointed governor of Lahore by the king of Delhi, and 
Nusrat, his younger brother, opposed Timur's invasion, with only 2,000 
men, on the Beas. 

Malik Jasrat, sou of Shaikha, is a historical personage. In 1442 A.D. 
he was murdered by his queen, a daughter of Bhim Deo, Kajil of 
Jammu, because her father had been put to death by the Malik. His 
descendants are found m Mari and Shakarpur in (iJujrat, at Malikwal 
in Shahpur, at Jasrat near Chiniot, and in Dhankar near Khangah 
Dogran. 

The Tartars spared the territories of Sarpal's descendants. After 
1200 A. D.t they had burnt all the Khokhar settlements on the Beas 
and Sutlej. Raja Vir Kh^n fled towards Multan, but returned and 
founded Kangra, kos from Chiniot, east of the Chenab, but soun moved 
towards the Beas with Kalu, his kinsman, who founded Ktiluwahan, now 
Kahnuwan,:}: in Gurdiispur, on the right bank of the river. For himself 
Vir chose a tract 32 kos south of Kahnuwan, and there he founded 
Vairowal in Tarn Taran, naming it after his son Vairo. Bharo, another 
tribesman, founded Bh^rowal in the same tahsil. Kulchandar, another 
Khokhar, founded Mirowdl, Marddna, Auliapur, etc., in Sitllkot. Raja 
Vir Khan also founded a new Kangra midway between Kahnuwan and 
Vairowal. His territory was 40 Icos in length, and the town extended 
5 miles along the bank of the Beds. At its north and south gates stood 
two forts or vidris,§ now occupied by Bhatti Rd,jputs|| and Panuan Jats. 
On the ruins of this town now stands the small village of Kaugra,^ lu'st 
opposite to Tahli or Khokharain on the west bank of the i3eas in 
Hoshiarpur. In the village is the tomb of Ladaha Khiin, Khokhar 
called the Pb' Ghdzi, at which offerings are still made. This ghdzi's 
head is said to be buried at Mandi Bohr, a village in Kapurthala 3 
miles south of Tahli, to which place it was carried by the stream when 
he was killed. Ladahd Khdn left seven sons, (i) Jago, whose descend- 
ants founded Dinamdl, Akalgadha and Kotli Sara Khan in Amritsar 
close to Bharowdl and Vairowal ; (ii) Rup Hai, whose sons founded 
Dand in Baya tahsil, Sialkot; (iii) Bego, who founded Begowal and J 6 
villages, now in Kapurthala; (iv) Dasihan, the author's ancestor, who 
founded Khokharain*"^ as his residence and 12 other villages: Jhan 
who founded Bale Chak, naming it after his son Balo, with 9 more 
villages. As these three brothers owned in all 40 villages the tract was 
called the Chalia Khokhariin. Bhogra migrated to Muradtibad.

544 KhoJchar history. 

The KhoJchars in the Muhammadan Historians of India.* 
In 399 A.H. (1009 A.D.) the Gakkhars, by whom in all probability 
are meant the Khokhars, then infidels, joiaed the Hindus who had 
collected under the leadership of Anandpdl to resist the sixth invasion 
of India by Mahmud. Their number is said to have amounted to 30,000 
men, who, with heads and feet bare, and armed with spears and other 
weapons, penetrated the Muhammadan lines on two sides, and in a few 
minutes cut down three or four hundred Muhammadans.t 

The earliest distinct mention of the Kokars occurs in the Tdj-uU 
Ma'dsir, a history written in A. H. 602 (1205 A.D.),t which describes 
the revolt of the tribe or confederacy under the chiefs Bakan andSarki, 
which occurred upon a false report of the death of the Sultan Muhammad 
of Ghor having been put about by Aibak Bdk, who seized Multan.§ 
The Kokars raised the country between the Sodra (Chend,b) and the 
Jhelum and defeated the Muhammadan governor of Saugsvan, who held 
a fief within the borders of Maltan, but they were defeated by Qutb-ud- 
Din Aibak, and one of the sons of Kokar Rai escaped to a fort in the 
hill of J ad, which was captured on the following da}*^ by the Sultdn.|j 

The next mention of the Khokhars occurs in the 'fahaqdt-i-Ndsri, 
written about 658 A. H. (1259 A. D.).l It relates that Muiz-ud-Din 
in 581 A. H. (1185 A. D.) ravaged the territory of Lahore, and on his 
return homeward restored Sialkot, in which fortress he left a garrison, 
but as soon as his back was turned, Malik Khusrau, the last of the 
Ghaznivides, assembled the forces of Hindustan and a levy of the 
Khokhar tribes and laid siege to Sialkot. This account is confirmed and 
amplified by A History of the Rdjds of Jammun, which says: — "The 
tribe of Khokhar, who dwelt round about Mangldn at the foot of the 
hills and were subject to the Jammu dynasty, having received encour- 
agement from the Lahore ruler (Malik Khusrau), and sure of his sup- 
port, refused any longer to pay tax and tribute to Jammu and throw oif 
its yoke." In return the Khokhars then assisted Malik Khusrau in his 
attempt on Sialkot, whose garrison was befriended by the Jammu forces.^* 

The next notice of the Khokhars in the Tabaqdt-i-Ndsiri ia an im- 
portant one, and confirms the account of the Tdj-ul-Ma'dsir, It de- 
scribes the confusion which arose in the Sultd,n's dominions on account 
of the rumour of his death, and states that the Khokhars (and other 
tribes of the hills of Lahore and Jud) broke out in rebellion in 602 H, 
and were defeated with great slaughter. tt In this rebellion the 
Khokhars appear to have been in alliance with the Rd,i Sal, the ruler 
of the Salt Range, or Koh-i-Jud, but it is not certain that Rdi Sdl 
himself was a Khokhar.

Khohhar history. 54g 

In 620 H. (1223 A. D.) the Sultan Jalal-ud-Din, driven from Gliazni 
by the Chingiz Khan, who pursued him to the Indus, «ou^ht a refuo-e 
m the Punjab. He occupied Balala and Nikala"^^ near Lahore, an'd 
being too weak to advance on Delhi, sent a part of his urmy acrainst 
the hillJud. This force defeated the Jihokhar chif^f, and the Sultan 
obtamed his daughter in marriage, whereupon the KhokharRait joined 
him with a considerable body of his tribe. 

The Khokhars had a long standing fend with Kub^cha, governor of 
Sindh fwhich then included the whole valley of the Indus below the 
Salt Range), and the Sultan's troops, under the guidance of the son of 
the Khokhar chief, by a forced march, fell suddenly upon Kubdcha's 
camp near Uch and totally defeated him. 

The Khokhars, however, do not appear to have been confined to the 
country between the Jhekim and the Chend,b, but to have also held a 
considerable tract east of theBe^s (and the good horses to be obtained 
in their talwandis or settlements are often mentioned), for in Q38 A. H. 
(1240 A. D.) we find them enlisted in the forces of the Sultdna (Queen) 
Hc4ziyyat and her consort Malik Ikhtiydr-ud-Din, Alt.unia, but they 
abandoned her after her defeat at Kaithal.J 

After the sack of Lahore by the Mughals in 1241-42 A. D., '' the 
Khokhars and other Hindu Gabra " seized it.§ And in 1246-47 A. D. 
the future Sultan Ghiyas-nd-Din Balban was sent, against the Khokhars 
into the Jud Hills and Jhelum.]] The Khokhars were apparently 
subjects of Jaspdl. Sihrd,.^ 

About this time Sher Khan reduced the Jats, Khokhars, Bhattis 
Minis (Mind,s), and Mand^hars under his sway,*"^* apparently in or liear 
his fief of Sun^m. 

Tn 647 A. H. (1250 A. D.) the upper part of the Punjab appears to 
have been in the hands of the Mughals and Khokhars,tt but nothino- 
more appears to be lieard of tbem until the reign of Muhamnifid Tug-hlaq 
Sh,4h, when they again began to be troublesome, and in 1342-43 A. D. 
they revolted under their chief, Chandar. The governor of the Punjab 
Malik Tdtdr Khdn, had to march against them, and though he was able 
to subdue them for a time, they caused great disorders under the last 
Tughlaq kings of Delhi. J J 

We now come to tlip Tdrihh'i-Muhdrak Shnhi, an imperfect manu- 
pcript, the history in which has had to be completed from the Tah'tqat- 
i-Akbari, which copieil from it. According to this history, the Khokhar

546 Khohhar history. 

Humd.yun, afterwards Sikandar Shdh I, was to have been sent against 
him'^ but his father, Muhammad Shah III, dying suddenly, he was too 
occupied in securing the throne to set out on the expedition. Sikandar 
Shah, however, only reigned some six weeks, and on his death Sultan 
Mahmiid Shah II, succeeded him, but it was not for some months that 
Strang Khan could be nominated by him to the fief of Dib^lpur and 
entrusted with the war against Shaikha. Sd,rang Khd,n took possession 
of Dibalpur in June, and in September he advanced on Lahore with 
the forces of Mult/m, and accompanied by the Bhatti and Main (Mind,) 
chiefs,t crossed the Sutlej at Tihara and the Beds at Dubdli. On hear- 
ing of Strang Khan's advance, Shaikha Khokhar invaded the territory 
of Dibd,lpur and laid siege to Ajudhan, bub bearing that Sarang Kbd,a 
had passed Hindupat and was investing Lahore, he returned hastily to 
that city and encountered Sarang Klidn at Samuthalla, 12 kos from it. 
There he was defeated by Sarang Khan and fled to the hills of Jud, 
while the victor took possession of Lahore. Four years later occurred 
the grim interlude of Tiraur's invasion. Shaikhd, says the historian, out 
of enmity to Sdrang Khd,n, early joined Timur and acted as his guide, 
in return for which he received mercy and honour,^ but before Timur 
left India he made Shaikhd prisoner, and with him all his wives and 
children. 

According to the histories of Timur, however, the Khokhary played 
a much more important part in the resistance offered to the invading 
armies of Timur than the Tdrikh-i-Muhdrah-Shdhi is inclined to adm'it. 
In October 1398 A. D., Tfmur halted at Jdl on the Beds, opposite 
Shdhpur. Here he learnt that Nusrat of the tribe of Khokhar was 
established in a fortress on the banks of a lake. He attacked Nusrat, 
and completely routed him, taking immense booty in cattle and burning 
Nusrat's residence. Nusrat himself was slain. Some of his followers 
escaped across the Beds, which Timur crossed, marching from Shah 
Nawdz to Janjan, a few days later. § We next read of Malik Shaikhd or 
Shaikh Kukar, ' commander of the infidels,* who was defeated and slain 
by Timur in the valley of Kupila or IIardwdr,[| The Zafarndma, how- 
ever, differs from this account. It mentions Ald-ud-Din as a deputy of 
Shaikh Kukari, who was sent as an envoy to Kupila,^ and describes 
the advance of a Malik Shaikha as being misreported as the advance of 
Shaikh Kukari, one of Timur's faithful adherents, a mistake which 
enabled Malik Shaikha to attack Timur unawares, though he was 
promptly repulsed and killed. Then we hear of Timiir's arrival at 
Jammu on his homeward march. In its neighbourhood he captured 
seven strongholds, belonging to the infidels, whose people had formerly 
paid the jizy a or poll-tax to the Sultan of Hindustdn, but had for a long 
time past cast off their allegiance. One of these forts belonged to Malik 
Shaikh Kukar, but, according to the Zafarndma, the owner of this

Khokhar history. 54^ 

stronghold was Sliaikii, a relation o£ Malik Shaikh Kukar* (or Shaikha 
Kukari), which possibly makes the matter clear : — Nusrat the Khokhar 
had been killed on the Be^s after which his brother, Shaikha, submitted 
to Timur, aiid was employed by him during liis advance on Delhi.f 
The Malik Shaikha killed at Kupila was nor. a Khokhar at all, but in 
Timur's Autohiography he has become confused with Malik Shaikha the 
Khokhar. Lastly, Malik Shaikha had a relative, probably a Khokhar, 
who held a little fort near Jammu.J 

After his am'est by Timur, Shaikhs disappears from history; but in 
823 A. H, (1420 A. D,), or some 22 years later, Jasrath (the son of) 
Shaikhs, makes his entrance en the scene. In that year the kino- of 
Kashmir marched into Sindh, and was attacked by Jasrath, who de- 
feated him, took him prisoner, and captured all his materiel. Elated 
by this success, Jasrath, an independent rustic, began to have visions 
about Delhi. Hearing that Khizr Khan (whom Timur had left ia 
charge of Mult^n as his feudatory, and who had become Sultan of 
Delhi in all but name) was dead, he crossed the Beas and Sutlej, defeat- 
ed the Mina leaders, and ravaged the country from Ludhiana to A.rubar 
(Rupar).§ Thence he proceeded to J^landhar, and encamped on the 
Bed.s, while Zirak Khan, the amir of S^mana, retired into the fort. 
After some negotiations it was agreed that the fort was to be evacuated 
and given up to Tughd,n, the Turk-bacha (Jasrath^s ally, who had taken 
refuge in his territories), while Jasrath waB to pay tribute'and return 
home. But as soon as Jasrath got Zirak Kh^o into his camp, he de- 
tained him as a prisoner and carried him, securely guarded, to 
Ludhiana, whence he marched to Sirhind. That fortress, however, 
defied all his attempts, and the Sultan Mubarak Shah, advancing, com- 
pelled him to raise the siege and retreat on Ludhiana, whence, having 
released Zirak Khan, he crossed the Sutlej. The Sultan's forces then 
advanced as far as Ludhiana, but were unable to cross the Sutlej, as 
Jasrath had secured all the boats. When the rains ceased, the Sultan 
withdrew to Kabulpur,|| and Jasrath made a similar movement, where- 
upon the Sultd,n sent a force to effect a crossing at Rupar. Jasr^ith 
marched on a line parallel to this force, but it effected a crossing, and 
the SuMn then passed the river without opposition. Jasrath's followers 
then abandoned the opposition he had chosen without striking a blow, 
and their leader fled hastily to Ludhiana, whence he crossed the Beds, 

* According to the Malfuzdt-i-Timuri, Malik Shaikha Khokhar was the brother of Nusrat 
Khokhar, formerly governor of Lahore on the part of Sultan Mahmiid of Delhi. After 
Nusrat's defeat Shaikha Khokhar had submitted to Ti'mur, and had accompanied hira on 
his inarch to the Jumna, his influence being sufficient for him to obtain protection for his 
subjects from pillage by Timur's army. Shaikhi, however, obtained Ti'mur's leave to 
return to Lahore, where he soon incurred the suspicion of being lukewarm in Timiir's cause 
and Timur sent orders to arrest Shaikha and levy a ransom from Lahore— £. H. I., Ill, 
p. 473. This account is confirmed by the Zafamdma, which calls Nusrat Kiikari brother 
of Shaikh^ Kukari— 16.. p. 485. Raverty states that some authorities say that Shaikha died 
a natural death, while others allege that he was put to death, Jasrath being imprisoned in 
Samarqand. Some years later Jasrath was released acd returned home. There he put to 
death Shahi, his brother, and, seizing Jalandhar and Kalanaur, began to aspire to the 
sovereignty of Hind. — Notes, p. 8G8.

the Ravi, and finally, after the Sultan liad crossed tbe latter river near 
Bhowa,* tlie Jatihava (Clienab). Jasrath now took refuge in his 
strongest place, Tekhart in the hiUs but Rai BhimJ of Jammu guided 
the Sult5,n's forces to the stronghold, and it was captured and destroyed. 
Jasrath's power was, however, undiminished, for as soon as the Sultan 
had returned to Delhi after restoring Lahore, he recrossed Chenab and 
Ravi with a large force of horse and foot, and attacked Lahore and was 
only driven oft after nearly five weeks' fighting round the fort. He 
then retreated on Kalanaur to attack that stronghold^ into which Rai 
Bhim had thrown himself in order to relieve Lahore. After protracted 
fighting round Kald-naur, Jasrath patched up a truce with Rai BhIm 
and then went towards the Ravi where he collected all the people of 
the territory of the Khokhars, who were in alliance with him, but on 
the advance of an imperial army fi"om Lahore, supported by one which 
advanced on the ford of Buhi, he again fled to Tekhar. The united 
forces of the Sultan now marched along the river Rd,vi and crossed it 
between Kalananr and Bhoh* afterwards effecting a junction with 
Rd,i Bhim on the confines of Jammii. These forces defeated some 
Khokhars who had separated from Jasrath on the Chenab. 

Li the following year (826 A. H. or 1423 A. D.) Jasrath defeated 
Rai Bhim and captured most of his horses and materiel. The Rai him- 
self was killed, and Jasrath now united himself to a small army of 
Mughals and invaded the territories of Dibalpur and Lahore, but on the 
advance of the imperial leader he retired across the Chendb. 

After this the Khokhars appear to have remained inactive for four 
or five years, but in 831 A. H. (1428 A. D.) Jasrath laid siege to 
Kaliinaur, aiid on advancing from Lahore to relieve the place, his old 
opponent, Sikandar Tuhfa, was defeated and had to retreat on Lahore. 
Jasrath then besieged J^landhar, but he was unable to reduce it, and so 
he retreated to Kalanaur, carrying off the people of the neighbourhood 
as captives. Reinforcements were seut to Sikandar, but before they 
arrived, he had asraia advanced to KaMnaur and united his forces with 
those of Rili Ghd,lib of that town. These leaders then marched after 
Jasrath and completely defeated hitu nt Kdngra on the Bels, recovering 
the spoils which he had gained at Jalandhar. Jasrath again took refuge 
iu Tekhar. 

In 835 A. H. (1431-2 A.D.), however, Jasrath descended from Telhar 
(Tekhar) and marched on Jalandhar, Sikandar drew out of Lahore to 
intercept him, but incautiously allowed his small force to be attacked 
by Jasrath's superior numbers and was defeated and taken prisoner, 
some of his followers escaping to Jalandhar. Jasrath in triumph 
marched on Lahore and laid siege to ib, but it was vigorously defended

defeated him prior to U23 A. D. About this time the Gakkhars, under Malik Kad, wrested 
their conquests from Zain-ul-Abidin.

its relief, he abandoned the siege, but kept Sikandar in captivity .* ;t • 

In 835 A. H. (1432 A. D.) Malik Allahdjid was appointed feudatory 
of Lahoi-e, but he waa promptly attacked on his arrival at Jdlandliar 
by Jasrath, defeated and compelled to seek a refujje in the hills of 
Kothi.t 

In 840 A. H. (1436 A. D.) the Sultan Muhammad Shdh sent an 
expedition against Shaikhs, {do) Khokhar, which ravaged his 
territories.^ 

In 845 A. H. (1441 A. D.) the Sultdn conferred Dibdlpur and Lahore 
on Bahlol Kh^n and sent him against Jasrath, but Jasrath made peace 
with him and flattered him vrith hopes of the throne of Delhi. § After 
this the Ivhokhar power declined, owing to causes of which we know 
nothing. 

In the time of Akbar the Khokhars held 5 out of 52 maluills in the 
Lahore sarhdr in the Bari Do^b, and 7 out of 21 pai-ganas in tho 
Chinhath Doab, with one mahdll each in the Bist-Jalandhar and 
Rachna Doabs. In the Dibdlpur sarhdr of Multan they held 3 out of 
30 mahdlls in the Bist-Jalandhar Dodb, and one in the Berun-i-Punjnad, 
west of the Indus. Raverty puts their population then at more 
than 200,000 souls. || 

It must be confessed that the above notes leave the question of the 
origin of the Khokhars precisely where it stood. In an account of the 
Katil Kdjputs from Gurd^spur it; is said that some of the (earliest) 
converts to Islam became known as Khokhars, but further on it says : 
" One of our ancestors settled in the fort of Mangla Devi in the Jainmu 
State and then took possession of Kharipur. Hence his descendants 
became known as Khokhars/-' after being converted to Islam in the 
time of Mahnnid of Ghazni. And further on it says that Kiitils 
do not intermarry with Khokhars, because the latter are of their blood 
and are descendants of Kdtils by Muhammadan wives.

ancestress the Khokhar Chuhrds do not eat the heart of any animal.

f 50 Khosa — Khoire. 

Khosa, {]) a very important Balocli tribe forming two distinct tumans^- 
one near Jacobiibddin Upper Sindh, the other with its head-quarters at 
Batil near Dera Ghazi Khan. Said to be mainly Hot by descent, they 
occupy the country between the Laghari and tlie Kasraui, their terri- 
tory being divided into a northern and a southern portion by the terri- 
tory of the Lunds, and stretching from the foot of the hills nearly across 
to the river. They are said to have settled originally in Kech ; but 
with the exception of a certain number in Bahawalpur they are, so 
far as the Punjab ia concerned, only found in Dera Ghazi. They hold, 
however, extensive lands in Sindh, which were granted them by 
Humayun iu return for military service. They are one of the most 
powerful tribes on the border, and very independent of their chief, 
and are '' admitted to be among the bravest of the Baloch." They are 
true Rinds and are divided in Dera Ghazi into 13 clans, of which the 
Balelani and Isiaiji are the most important, the latter being an 
affiliated offshoot of the Khetrans. The others are the Jangel, Jindani, 
Ji^ni, Jarwdr, Hamalani, Tombiwala, Mihrwani, Haiti, Jajela,* Lashari 
and Umarani. The Khosa is the most industrious of the organised 
tribes ; and at the same time the one which nest to the Gurchani bears 
the worst character for lawlessness. In 1859 Major Pollock wrote : 
" It is rare to find a Khosa who has not been in prison for cattle- 
stealing, or deserved to be ; and a Khosa who has not committed a 
murder or debauched his neighbour's wife or destroyed his neighbour's 
landmark is a decidedly creditable specimen." And even now the 
description is not very much exaggerated. 

There is also a Khosa aah-tuman of the Kiads of Shorau, and a 
Khosa clan of the Lunds of Tibbi. 

(2) u tribe of J ats, said to be of Tur Rajput origin and to have 
been expelled from Delhi by the Chauhans. The people so plundered 
were called Khosas.t They used to wear the jane o, but after contract- 
ing unions with Jats they gave it up, except at Rattiar in Moga 
tahsil in Ferozepur, where the Khosas still wear it, avoiding social inter- 
course with other Khosas. The Khosas hold the title in reverence 
because in the flight from Delhi an eagle saved a new-born child — 
in the usual way. At weddings bread is still thrown to kites. The 
boy's name was Bhai Randhir and Khosa Randhir in Moga is named 
after him. His pond in this village is the scene of a mela held there 
in Mdgh and all Khosas have their wishes fulfilled or fulfil their 
vows there. Another special custom at Khosa weddings is that when 
the bride reaches the bridegroom's house the Dum conceals the takJcula 
of a spinning wheel iu the village dung-heaps, and the pair are made 
to search for it by the common till they find it.

Khumea (KhemraI. — A caste of Hindustan, and found only in the eastern 
parla of the Punjab. His trade is dealing in and chipping the stones 
of the hand-mills used in each family to grind flour ; work which is 
believed to be generally done by Tarkhdns in the Punjab proper. 
Every year these men may be seen travelling up the Grand Trunk 
Road, driving buffaloes which drag behind them millstones loosely 
cemented together for convenience of carriage. The millstones are 
brought from the neighbourhood of Agra, and the men deal in a 
small way in buffaloes. They also sing at fairs, and in Karnal work as 
weavers. They are almost all Musalraan.

552 Kirdr — KoMstdni. 

KiRAR, fern, -i, a word almost synonjmoug with coward, and even more 
contemptuous than is the name Banyd in the east of the Province. 
The term appears to be applied to all the western or Punjabi traders 
as distinct from the Biiny^s of Hindustan, and is so used even in 
the K^iigra hills. But the Arora is the person to whom the term is 
most commonly applied, and Khatris repudiate the name altogether 
as derogatory. The Kirar appears as a terrible coward in the proverbs 
of the countryside : " The tliieves were four and we eightj'-four; the 
thieves came on and we ran away. Damn the thieves ! well done us ! " 
And again : " To meet a Eathi armed with a hoe makes a company of 
nine Kird-rs feel alone. " Yet the peasant has a wholesome dread of 
the Kirar when in iiis proper place. " Vex not the ^At in his jungle, 
or the Kirar at his shop, or the boatman at his ferry ; for if you do, 
they will break your head." Again : " Trust not a crow, a dog, or a 
Kirar, even asleep." So again : " You can't make a friend of a 
Kirdr any more than a satti of a prostitute." 

KiRAUNK, Karaunk, Keaunk, Kirawak, a man whose duty it is to call 
people together for hegdr or forced labour; also called Satv.-dq or 
' bearer of burdens.' LyaU speaks of the Kirank as one of the nich or 
inferior castes of Hindus in Kdngra, but it is doubtful whether it is 
not rather an occupational term, applied to any Koli or Dagi who 
adopts this calling. In the Simla Hills the term Karawak is generally 
applied to a Koli, but in the Koti fief of Keen thai there are two 
villao-es wlipre Karawaks live and form a distinct caste, ranking higher 
than t!ie Kolis. These were originally Kanets. Once a cow died in a 
cow-shed and there being no D^gi or Koli pre?ent, a Kanet dragged 
its carcass out of the house. The Kanets outcasted him and his 
descendants are called Kardwaks. The Kunets do not intermarry or 
dine with them. They can enter a Kanet's house but must not go into 
the kitchen. They correspond to the Batwd,ls, Balahar, etc., of the low 
hills and the plains.

KoHJA.—In the Jullundur tahsil, the first J^ts to become Musalmatis would 
seem to have been the Kaujas or Kohjas v/ho hold five villao-es ; one 
of which is called Kauja, where the Kingra cho enters the^ District. 
They say their ancestor was a giant who accompanied Sultdn Mahmud 
of Ghazni in one of his invasions and settled down here as he liked the 
country. His name was Ali Muhammad or Manju, and he was nick- 
named Koh-Cha, or 'little mountain/ on account of his size. The 
change from Koh-cha to Kauja or Kohja is simple. Six of their 
septs (the Sim, Sadhu, Arak, Sin, Dhanoe, and Khunkhun) claim to 
be of Arab descent, and so were originally Muhammadans. The ethers 
were converted at various times since the reign of Akbar. The above 
mentioned six septs at least intermarry on equal termp. The Kohjas 
avoid the use of beef and till lately observed Hindu rites, as well as 
the Muhammadan nikdh, at weddings. They sank to Jdt status by 
marrying Jat women.

tonsure of their children at Durgd,'s shrine in the Dahmi ildqa of 
Alwar. C/. Kuk. 

KoKARAH, a Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Multan. Cf. Kukdra. 

KoKRAYA, a tribe of Jdts. 

Kola, an inhabitant of KuUu, and, according to Sir Denzil Ibbetson, a 
distinct word from Koli, vide p. 218 swpra. The form Kold is 
probably correct, just as Ldhuld, is used outside Ldhul in Kullu for an 
inhabitant of Ldhul. 

Koli. — The term Koli is used in three distinct senses. First, as a territorial 
term it denotes a resident of Kullu, and Lyall speaks of the Rdjaa of 
Kullu as Koli Rajd,s.t He adds that the name Koli is applied, out 
of Kullu, to any Kullu man, but Kola would appear to be the mora 
correct form. Ho observes that they were not of pure Rajput blood, 
a fact indicated by their use of the title Singh iustead of Sen or 
Pdl, the usual Rajput aflBx, and that they were probably Kanets by 
origin, popular tradition making them for some time petty Tbdkurs or 
barons of the upper Kullu valley. J Second, it denotes the Ko]i§ of the 
Hills, who is practically the same as the Dagi, or in Chamba as the 
SiPPi. Third, it is used of the Cliam^rs in the south-east Punjab who 
have taken to weaving. The Koli of the plains belong in all probability

§ Koli is often given as a K^jput sept or family. 



6.')<4 KoU growps, 

to the great Kori or Koli tribe of the Chamars, the head-quarters 
of which is in Ondh. These men are commonly classed with Chamdrs 
in the districts in which they are found, but are distinguished from 
the indigenous Chamdrs by the fact of their weaving only, and doing 
no leather work. Indeed they are commonly known as Chamdr- Julahds. 
Mr. Benton wrote : "The Cham^r-Juld.bd,s have no share in the village 
skins, and do no menial service ; but they would be very glad to be 
entered among the village Chamars, who have anticipated them 
and driven them to weaving as an occupation." I very much doubt 
whether this is generally true. As a rule the substitution of weaving 
for leather work is made voluntarily, and denotes a distinct rise in 
the social scale. Tho Karndl Kolis do not obtain the services of 
Brdhmans. 

It is, however, very possible that the Kolis of the hills are identical 
with those of the plains, or that both are really so named because 
they follow the same callings. Thus in the Simla Hills, the term 
Koli is supposed to be derived from Kuhn, ' degraded from a family,' 
i. e., of Sudra status ; and the Dagi caste is said to be an ofishoot of the 
Kohs, which got its name from dragging away dead cattle {dangar or 
4aga), so that a Koli who took to removing the carcases of cattle was 
called a Ddgi Koli. Neither Kolis nor Dd,gis may wear a gold ornament"^ 
or a sihrd (chaplet) at a wedding in those Hills, but in the Siwdliks and 
lower Himalayas Kolis may wear both, though Chamnrs may not. 
Again Dagis and Chamars may intermarry, as a Dagi who makes 
shoes becomes a Cham^r. Otherwise he remains a Dd.gi. Yet the 
Kolis rank above the Chamdrs or Ddgis and in the lovyer Himalayas 
a Kanet will drink water from a Koli's brass vessel, but not from 
any earthen vessel of his. These appear to be the Sucha or * pure ' 
Kolis of the following note : — 

Once upon a time, when the Simla Hills were occupied by Kanets, cattle disease carried 
off nearly all the cattle of the villagers. As no shoe-makers (Chamars ") were available to 
remove the countless dead kine, and as the villagers could take no food till the carcases 
were removed from their houses, they took counsel to get out of the difficulty they were in, 
and some Kanet families undertook to remove them, but these families were avoided by the 
other Kanets, as they were polluted by touching the dead kine, and were termed Kolis. 
Thus the Kolis are degraded Kanets. But they retain their gols, so that the Koli gots are the 
same as those of the Kanets, and some Kolis of the Shandilya and Kashyap gots are found in 
these hills. Kolis do not touch beef. But they gladly eat the flesh of a male buffalo offered 
to a goddess in sacrifice. They also freely eat the flesh of a black bear. There are no 
Sacha Kolis in the Simla Hills, f but only Sucha Kolis. The Pah4ri word suchd means pure 
or purified, from the Sanskr. Shuchi, pure, purified or clean. They are like the Jhinwars 
of the plains, and water may be taken from their hands. The Koli deity is called Khathe- 
Bhar. 



* This prohibition would appear to be due to some old sumptuary law of the Rajis. 
Bimilarly, at funerals Kolis may use the iholki (drumj and saiidi (pipe), but no others : 
Kanets may use any musical instruments except the narsingha— and even that may be used 
by permission. In the higher ranges it is customarj' to beat a drum at funerals, but in the 
lower the dafm, sanhh and jhallar are used. 

t On the other hand a very careful observer (Mr. W. Coldstream), wrote :— 
♦' In the lower hills (at least I have seen them in Bilaspur State) there are Sachd KoKs, 
from whose hands Rajputs and Mians can eat and drink. The fact is that the necessity of 
havinf' menials ceremonially pure has created these Sacha Kolis, for Jhinwars and Brah- 
mans^are not everywhere to be got to supply food and drink, especially in the lower hills. 
The colonies of Sachd Kolis I saw were near forts, and they served the garrison (as water- 
carriers, etc.)" 



The Kolis of the hills. 555 

In the Simla Hills another story about the origin of the Kolis is that 
a Kanet father had two sons by two wives and divided his property 
between them, it being agreed on that who should bo the first to 
plough in the morning should get the first share. The younger brother 
was the first to wake and went forth to plough. The elder waking 
and finding him gone attempted to plough the courtyard, but finding it 
too narrow in a passion killed the bullock with an axe. For this he 
was turned out of his caste. He had two sons, one of whom lived a 
respectable life, while the other was guilty of ekinning and eating 
dead oxen. From the first son descended the Kolia, who generally do 
no menial work, the Kanets will drink but not intermarry with them. 
From the second son are descended the Dagolis who skin and eat 
dead cattle. They are further sub-divided into Dagoli and Thdkur of 
whom the former will not eat with the latter because they eat and 
drink with Muhammadans. And between the Kolis and Dagolis come 
the Dums who are considered helow the Kolis and ahove the Dagolis, 
and though they do not bury or eat cattle the Kanets will not drink 
with them. They are endogamous. 

In Kumh^rsain the Kolis appear to be divided into three classes, 
of which two may wear gold and intermarry,^" while the third is 
not allowed to do so and forms a separate sub-caste, called Bashirru, 
Karriru and (or) Shilu, which is very numerous in Kullu. The 
Bashirru are closely allied with the Jihotra group, but the people of 
Kumh^rsain will not eat anything cooked by them, though the Kolis of 
Sirmur do not appear to object to doing so. 

But another account divides the Kolis of the Simla Hills into two 
classes : [i) those who do no menial work, and with whom Kanets 
will drink (but not marry), and {ii) the Dagolis who skin dead kine and 
eat beef. And the latter again have a sub-group called Raherf who 
will eat and drink with Muhammadans and so are out-casted even by 
the Dagolis. The Dums rank between the Kolis and the Dagolis. 

In Kullu the Dagi is commonly styled Koli, or, in Sar^j, Betu.J 
But those Kolis who have taken to any particular trade are called 
by the trade name, e.gr., hdrdrii, basket maker ; harhye, carpenter ; 
daugri, iron-smelter ; pumhe, wool cleaner ; and these names stick 
to families long after they have abandoned the trade, as have been the 
case with certain families now named Smith and Carpenter in 
England. § So also Chamdrs and Lohd,rs, though they have been 
classed separately, or probably only Dagis (Kolis) who took to those 

* Only those whose hereditary occupation is tailoring are allowed to wear gold — not even 
those who have recently adopted it. 

t The Raher in these hills are like the sweepers or Bhangis of the plains. 

X [Bethu or haitjm, z low-caste (Dagi) attendant on a Kanet (or upper class family : 
Diack's Kulu Dialect of Hindi, p. 51.]. On the other hand the majority of the low castes 
in Kullu were in 1891 returned as Dagis in Kullu proper (the Kullu tahsil) and as Kolis in 
Saraj, and the terms appear to be synonymous though the latter is preferred as implying 
no reproach. Besides the derivation from ddg, cattle, Dagi is also said to be derived from 
dagrid to fell. Neither ddg nor dagnd is given by Diack, op. cit. 

_ § In Kullu the higher castes are styled Mitarka (derived from Ihitar-Jcd, ' of the inner 
circle '), while the lower are called Barka, ' of the outer circle '. The latter include the 
Thiwi or carpenter, Darehi, ferryman, Koli or Dagi and Barehi or axeman, Lohar and 
Barra (or Bilra), an ironsmelter or worker in nirgdl, and Chamar in the order given : Kullu 
Gazetter, 1897, p. 61. 



658 The Kolis as clients, 

trades j but at tho present day other Digis will not eat with the 
Lobars, and in some parts they will not eat or intermarry with the 
Chamdrs. Most Ddgis will eat the flesh of bears, leopards, or 
langiir monkeys. All except the Lohd,rs eat the flesh of cattle who 
have died a natural death. They stand in a subordinate position to 
the Kanets, though they do not hold their lands of them. Certain 
families of D^gis, Chaoa^rs, and Lohdrs are said to be the koriddrs, 
i.e., 'the courtyard people' of certain Kanet families.* V^'hen a Kanet 
dies, his heirs call the horiddr D%is through their jatai or headmen : 
they bring in fuel for the funeral pile and funeral feast, wood for 
torches, play the pipes and drums in the funeral procession, and do 
other services, in return for which they get food and the Mria or 
funeral perquisites. The dead bodies of cattle are another perquisite 
of the D%is, but they share them with the Cham^rs : the latter take 
the skin, and all divide the flesh. The Dd.gis carry palanquins when 
used at marriages. The Lohdrs and Chamars also do work in iron 
and leather for tlie Kanets, and are paid by certain grain allowances. 
The dress of the Ddgis does not diffc?r materially from that of the 
Kanets, except in being generally coarser in material and scantier 
in shape. Their mode of life is also much the same. 

Sir James Lyall has the following instructive passage on the 
- evolution of the Koli, but he frankly acknowledges that popular 
ethnology, which almost invariably describes a low as formed from 
a higher caste by degradation, is not on his side : — 

" From the natural evolution of caste distinctions in this direction, I would reason that 
once all the lower castes in Kullu ate the flesh of cattle, but as Hindu ideas got a firmer 
footing, the better off refrained and applied to themselves the name of Koh'.f Popular tra- 
dition seems, however, to go in the opposite direction, for according to it the Kolis came 
from Hindustan and gradually fell to their present low position. The real KoH, or as he ia 
called in Kullu the Sachcha Koll, is found in Kotlehr, Lambagraon, etc., of Kingra proper. 
There the caste is also very low, but tradition ascribes to it a much higher position than it 
now holds. The Kolis of Ki,ngra will not have intercourse with the Kolis of Kullu on equal 
terms ; the latter admit their inferiority and ascribe it to their being defiled by touching 
flesh. But it is the same with Brahmans of the plains and of the hills ; they will not inter- 
marry. 

" I am not aware what position the Kolis of Kangra hold to the Chanils of Kingra, but I 
believe they are considered inferior to them, and that they will not eat together nor 'inter- 
marry. Th« Chanals of Kangra will not, I understand, touch dead cattle, and will not mil 
on equal terms with those that do. There are some Chandls in Outer Saraj who are con- 
sidered inferior to the Kolfs there." 



* The Kullu Gazetter of 1897 gives a somewhat different version. It describes the Kolii 
or Dagis as notoriously lazy, ignorant and thriftless. In dress and customs they do not 
differ materially from Kanets, except that they are generally poorer and have no caste 
scruples. i;ach/a?»n7j/ is attached to a family of Kanets for whom they perform th« cus- 
tomary menial services on the occasion of a birth, a marriage or a death, receiving in return 
the leavings of the ceremonial feasts, and alto certain allowances at harvest time : this re- 
lationship is known as that of l-asain (the Kanet) and dhani,~hdru or TchoUddr (the Dagi) 
Diack adds that the Dagi family has the sole right of performing ceremonial functions, e. <?.' 
at a funeral, such as can only be undertaken by persons of low caste : op. ci/., p. 51. He 
translates cZ/iani as 'master'. For the term haiain we may perhaps compare Itasdn in 
Ludhiana. 

t But supplementary to and contradictory of this view is the account given in the 
Mandi State Gatetteer, p. 30. Accordmg to that authority the Kolis claim Kanet origin 
and say that the offspring of a Kanet by a low-caste woman is called a Koli. They 
perform menial services for Kanet landholders at festivities and are also cultivators 
but are all notoriously lazy. The Chan41s form a branch of the Kolis, but are inferior 
to them in rank and live by extracting oil and carrying loads on ponies. ' The Chanil gota 
are Lakkar, Chauhan, Takrial, SJyahi, Mhotlu, Dborung and Kathwari. No Koli got$ are 
mentioned.

Koli'^Krishni, 557 

Thus the Koli is found as far west as Cliamb^,, throughoufc the Hindu 
States of the North-east Punjab, in Kdngra and the Siwaliks, He 
is also found in Sirmur to the eastward, and in that State he occupies 
a low position, below the Lohdr, Bidi and Bd,jgi, but above the 
Chanel and Dumrd,. He must not let his shadow fall upon any person 
of high caste, and cis-Giri Kanets and Bh^ts will not even drink 
water touched by him. Yet these two castes and even Rajputs will 
drink freely water brought by him in a metal vessel and can prepare their 
food in his house if it has been fresh plastered with cow- dung. The 
term Koli is almost synonymous with ' serf,' and at weddings Kolis 
go on foot or on ponies, but not use palanquins or a kettledrum 
(naqdra).* Ritual marriage is indeed not solemnised among some of 
them, the jhajra form being often used or merely the simple rite 
of putting a nose-ring into the bride's nose.t

disused their old costume and intermarried freely with the neighbour-

kishni who worship none but Krishn, and are remarkable for the 
combination they present of the extreme Sliaiva and Vaishnava prac- 
tices. They are said to have been founded by Muni Ditatre* to be 
connected closely with the Sanidsis, or even to be a sect of the Bd,m- 
margis, to be recruited from both sexes and to worship nude before the 
image of their god. On the other hand, they are devoted to the holy 
places of the Vaishnavas, to Gobardhan, Mathra, the Godd,vari, and all 
that has to do with the history of Krishn : they read the Bh^gavat 
Gita ; they are scrupulous observers of the sanctity of animal life ; they 
are even reported to have been originally a Jain community, and to 
have only gradually adopted the ordinary Hindu customs relating to 
marriage and the like. In Lahore they are known as Bai ; and their 
priests wear salmon-coloured clothes and white scull-caps, with flaps 
over the ears. They reverence more especially the Narbada and the 
deity Chang Dev, whose shrine is on or near that river ; they worship 
his statue, which resembles that of Krishn and which is made of black 
wood or stone, and on the head of which they keep a small stone 
brought from the Narbada hills. At the time of prayer males and 
females alike are said to divest themselves of their clothes and to wor- 
ship thus the image which only the initiated know to be that of Chang 
Dev and not of Krishn. They keep a handkerchief in their temple 
which is called sesh, and with which every one who enters the temple, 
wipes his or her hands. They are given to the practice of charms 
and will neither reside nor eat anything near a Hindu temple.

KuCHBAND, lit. 'brush-binder.' The term is not a generic name, but 
an occupational one. The Kuchbands settled in Hissd.r say that their 
place of origin is Chitor in Rdjputdna, and that, during some catastro- 
phe, vaguely stated to have occurred some two or three centuries ago, 
some tribes migrated north and assumed this designation and calling. 
The Kuchband gots are — Chauhdn, Punwdr, Gablot, Kdchwa, Band,ns, 
Sulankhi or Solkhi, Surhia, Sassaud, Badgujar, and Morwar. They 
learnt brush-making from Changar, and their women also acquired 
the art of baking toys of clay. In Hoshiarpur the Kuchbands are 
regarded as Kanjars by others, but say themselves that they are 
Ghards; and in that District their ^o^s are Sud, Batwdr, Bes, -jakarh^ra, 
Sankal, Baguhar and Sonrd. No longer nomads they are now more 
or less settled, especially in the suburbs of Delhi, and in the canton- 
ments of Ambala and Mathra. At Ambtlla they intermarry with Sdnsis

story of a contest between this Muni and Guru Gorakh Nath, which would place the former 
at a date much later than Shankar Acharaj and either this Ditatra or another of the same 
name is looked on as the founder of the Jaikishni sect.

and Kanjars from the Pliulkidn States, whence they came. They earn a 
living as shikaris, makers of hhas-hhas screens and even as domestic ser- 
vants in cantonments. Their women also make and sell hinnds (cushions 
for carrying loads on the head) and chinkds (nets for hanging up food, etc 
m) and even as prostitutes. But as a tribe they are no Jougei* crimioal' 
Calling themselves Hindus, their observances are all like those in 
vogue among Hindus. Sweeper women are employed as mid wives 
at a fee of snnas 4 for a boy and 2^ for a girl. The birth of a boy 
is celebrated by the distributiou of sugar. 

No Kuchband may marry within his own clan, and, as the Punw^r 
and Surankhi stand highest in the social scale, it is considered an 
honour to intermarry with them. Marriage is contracted in this 
way: At betrothal, the parents of the bridegroom present five 
rupees to the bride's family ; this is the whole ceremony.-^ At the 
wedding, a pole is fixed upright in the ground and a burning coal 
placed at its foot. A brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, of either the 
bride or bridegroom binds the right-hand thumb of the one to the thumb 
of the left hand of the other, and the couple circle round the pole seven 
times and afterwards blow seven times on to the coals. Then the bride- 
groom takes the bride into his thatch or tent, and unties the knot in- 
forming her at the time that it is his tent and her future shelter. 
The bride returns to her parents. 

The niuhldwa, or home-coming, is performed in this wise. When 
the paJckhis are struck and the tribe starts on a tour, the bridegroom 
accompanied by a panck of two men as witnesses, goes to the bride's 
residence and there presents Ks. 20 to her parents. He is then 
allowed to pass one night under his father-in-law's roof and next day 
takes his bride home, the bridegroom's two witnesses exhorting the pair 
on their duty towards each other. A second, or kareiva, marriage ia 
very rarely resorted to. The bridegroom never mentions the name 
of his mother-in-law. 

When a death occurs, the corpse is carried on a bier of bamboos 
shaped like a ladder, to the Hindu burning place. They do not 
collect any of the ashes {phiil) after the body is burnt. Three days 
later the deceased's near relations and those who carried the bier go 
to the burning place and convey with them a small quantity of milk. 
The ashes are collected in one place and the milk sprinkled on them. 
On the 12th day the corpse bearers are fed with rice and sugar and 
the remnant is distributed. 

Although these Kuchbands style themselves Hindus they will eat 
food cooked by almost any caste. Cow's flesh alone is abjured by them. 
Of wild animals they catch and snare jackal, lizards (sdnda), iguanas' 
foxes, porcupines, pig, hares, deer, and consume the flesh of all of them! 



♦ In Hoshiarpur two emissaries of the boy's father go to the bride's house and are 
given liquor. In return they distribute two rupees worth of sweetmeats and so confirm 
the betrothal. A marriage letter is sent as among Hindus, to Hx the date for the 
shampooing of the pair with ivhufnd. The 2}herds at the wedding are made bj the boy's 
sister or sister's daughter or by the girls. But the couple blow on to the fire. When 
the wedding procession has withdrawn to its halting place, the boy's sister takes him in 
her arms and gets a rupee. The shawls of the pair are then unknotted, the boy salutes 
hie father-in-law and gets a rupee, which is spent on liquor. 



560 Kudhmi'^Kuka. 

Like other aboriginal tribes, the Kuchbauds extract curative oil from 
sdnda lizard and do blood-letting with leeches or by the cupping process. 

The Kuchband in Hiss^r worship Rdm Deo and Lalta Masani. The 
temple of the former is said to lie in the desert 20 miles west of 
Bikdner. A fair takes place there twice a year in Bhadon and Md,gh, 
and on these occasions the Kucliband visit the shrine and make an 
offering of one rupee each. They have no respect for other places 
of pilgrimage, such as Hardwar, Jawdlaji, etc. They also worship 
the cow. In the event of any one falhng sick, it is customary to 
invoke Rdm, thus — " Rdm, we will offer one seer of grain to your 
mother cow." Should the patient recover, a cow is led. If small-pox 
breaks out the tribe visits the shrine of Lalta Masdni inGurgdon. A 
promise is then made to bring up two virgins to her service ; food is 
given to two old and to two young women in her name, and a cocoanut 
is offered on the shrine. 

The Kuchband in Hoshidrpur say they are descended from Khizr 
Pdl of AUdhbds in the Aligarh District of the United Provinces. 
There is also a Mahardni's shrine at Allahbds, and at her shrine a 
pig is sacrificed. The animaFs forehead is daubed with vermilion and 
an earring put in its ear. It is then killed by sticking a large needle 
into its ribs, the head used to make a palao, while the rest of the 
flesh is cooked separately and thrown into the fire with five loaves and 
some liquor as an offering to Maharani. 

Kuchbands have a dialect or at least an argot of their own and 
nicknames for many tribes. The Jdt is called a Pant, the Mahdjan or 
money-lender a Kapnia, the Chamdr a Namoa, the Gujar a Jhomar 
and the Musalman a Dela.

Uddsis belonged one Bdlak Singh, an Arora by caste, of Hazro in 
Attock, who about 1846 inaugurated among the Sikhs a movement 
which was directed against the participation of Brahmans in weddings, 
and, generally^ against their influence over the community. He 
formed adherents in the Sikh garrison of the fort, and they became 
known as Sagrdsi or Habids."^ On Bdlak Singh's death in 1863 his 
nephew Kahn Singh succeeded him, retaining in the locality a certain 
number of followers, whose doctrines are never divulged. Balak 
Singh's teaching was, however, taken up by Rdm Singh, a carpenter 
of Bhaini Aid in Ludhidna,t where he built an extensive dera and

maintained considerable state. He preached that he was himself an 
incarnation of Guru Govind Singh and prophesied the speedy over- 
throw of the British power. In 1872 tbe Kukas rose without any- 
concerted plan, and a band of about 150 invaded the Mdler Kotla State 
and attacked the capital, but were beaten off. A.t Rurr, a village 
in Patidla, thoy surrendered and 49 of them were executed by the 
Deputy Commissioner of Ludhitlna. Ram Singh who had not 
personally participated in the events was deported to Rangoon where 
he died in 1888, but his followers believe he is stiJl alive and will 
re appear. His brother Budh Singh inherited the dera. Rd,m Singh 
had divided the Punjab into districts, each under an agent, who bore 
the Muhammadan title oisuba"^ and was under his direct control. His 
followers were called Ktikasf or " shouters " because, unlike other 
Sikhs, they fall into a state of frenzy {waidyX during their devotions 
shaking their heads and shouting their prayers. The latter end with 
a cry of Sat Sri Akdl,'' God is True." Like many other sects they 
have been accused of holding orgiastic rites. Outwardly the Kuka is 
often distinguished by the sidhi jiag, a special way of tying the turban 
straight, and by a knotted necklace of woollen cord the knots of which 
are used like beads of a rosary. Of recent years the sect has adopted 
the name Nd.mdhd,ria. The Kukas are not an order, but at the 
edifice erected at Durga (near Nawdshahr in Jullundur) in honour of 
Guru Tegh Bahddur the ministrants are said to be Kukas. The Kukds 
revere the Sau Sdhhi, a book which professes to be a conversation 
between Sahib Singh and Gurbaksh Singh on the sayings and doings

gave their name to the town of Kul^chi, from which the tahsil of 
Kuldchi takes its name. But at the close of the 18th century they 
were described as once subjects of the Mirrani Baloch and then 
tributary to Mirza Kh^n, the Qizzilbdsh, to whom they paid Rs. 12,000 
a year in revenue. They appear to have accompanied the Hot, who 
found Dera Ismail Khd,n, in considerable numbers, but settled in that 
tract as cultivating proprietors rather than as a military caste and 
they have now sunk to the status of Jd,ts, Kuld,chi tahsil having been 
overrun by the Gandapur Pathans who are still dominant in it,

fern. -f. The Kumhar, or, as he is more often called in the Punjab, 
Ghumid^r, is the potter and brick-burner of the country. He is most 
numerous in Hissd-r where he is often a husbandman, and in the sub- 
montane and central districts. On the lower Indus he has returned 
himself in some numbers as Jd,t. He is a true village menial, receiving 
customary dues, in exchange for which he supplies all earthen vessels 
needed for household use, and the earthenware pots used on the Persian- 
wheel wherever that form of well gear is in vogue. He also, alone of 
all Punjab castes, keeps donkeys ; and it is his business to carry grain 
within the village area, and to bring to the villaofe grain bought else- 
where by his clients for seed or food. But he will not carry grain out 
of the village without payment. He is the petty carrier of the villages 
and towns, in which latter he is employed to carry dust, manure, 
fuel, bricks, and the like. His religrinn appears to follow that of the 
neighbourhood in which he lives. His social standing is very low, far 
below that of the Lobar and not very much above that of the Cham^r ; 
for his hereditary association with that impure beast the donkey, the 
animal sacred to Sitala, the small-pox goddess, pollutes him; as also his 
readiness to carry manure and sweepings. He is also the brick-burner 
of the Punjab, as he alone understands the working of kilns; and it is 
in the burning of pots and bricks that he comes into contact with 
manure, which constitutes his fuel. It would appear that he makes 
bricks also when they are moulded ; but the ordinary village brick of 
sun-dried earth is generall}'^ made by the coolie or Chamar. The 
Kumhar is called Pazawagar or kiln-burner, and Kuzagar (vulg. Kuj- 
gar) or potter, the latter term being generally used for those only who 
make the finer sorts of pottery. The Gilgar, Gilsd,z and Gilkar should 
probably be regarded as groups of the Rd,j or Tarkh^n, rather than 
of the Kumhdr. Grave-diggers, gorkun or gorJcand, are said to be 
generally Kurah4rs. In Peshawar and in Attock and Rawalpindi the 
Kumhdr is known as the KnMl or Kaldl. Multd^ni in Gurgd,on is said 
to denote a Kumhar, potter's work being often done there by men from 
Multdn. Phusrai also appears to be a synonym. On the frontier the 
potter appears to be known as Gilgo. 

The Kumhars are both Hindus or Sikhs and Muhammadans by re- 
ligion. 

The Hindu Kumhars. 

The Hindu Kumhdr is sometimes termed, honorifically Parjdpafc or 
Prajdpati, after the Vedic Prajdpatis, who were lords and creators of 
the universe, because they make things of earth. In Kapurthald, how 



Kumhdr origins. §6^ 

ever, the title is said to be bestowed on tlie Kumhars because thoy trade 
in grain and transport it. In Nd^bha the Kumhdr* claims descent from 
Brahma as in the well-known lines : — 

Bam j at ha Rdngra, Kishn jdt kd Ahir, 

Brahmmd jdt Kumhdr hai, 8heo kijdtfaqir. 

" Rama was by caste a Rangar, Kishen an Ahir, Brahmma a Kumhdr, 
and Shiva ?hfaqir." 

Once, runs the legend, Brahma divided some sugarcane among his sons, 
and each of them ate his piece, except the Kumhdr who put his into a 
pitcher full of earth and water in which it struck root. When the god 
some days later asked his sons for the cane, they bad none to tnve him, 
but the Kumhdr offered his to the god and received from him the title 
of Parjdpat or ' Glory of the World '. But nine other sons of Brahma, 
ancestors of the Brahmans, also received the title. 

Tradition also points persistently to the hhagat or saint, Kubba, as 
an ancestor of the Kumhdrs. In Gurgaon he is said to have had two 
wives, the first of whom ran away from her home and so her children 
were called Gola. The second wife's offspring were called Mahr or 
Mahdr because she was the sister of the first. Another version is that 
the first wife after forsaking her husband married his servant, gola. 
In these legends the Mahrs claim superior status to the Golas, but the 
latter tell quite another story. Thus in the Bdwal nizdmat of Nabha 
the Golas say that Brahma had 60,000 sons whom he ordered to make 
earthenware. To one of them he gave a gola (ball) for a pattern. He 
made vessels like it, and a vessel larger than a pitcher and called gol 
is still made in Bawal by the Kumhdrs. Hence they are called Golas. 
Brahma also gave him a wheel on which to make pottery. For this 
reason all Hindus at a wedding go to a Kumhdr^s house to reverence 
the chak,'f when Brahma is worshipped. 

And yet again the Golas in Nabha claim Kubd as one of themselves 
and say that he it was who made 20 pitchers a day to give away as 
alms, until one day 30 sdhds came to his house ; nevertheless relying 
on God's grace he bade his wife sit behind a curtain and hand each of 
them a pitcher. Miraculously the 20 vessels became 30, as described 
in the following version of the well-known lines : — 

Kuhd hhagat Kumhdr Ihd, 

Bhdndd ghartd his. 
Har Govind kirpd kari, 

Hue his ke tis. 

" Kubd was a potter and made 20 pots a day j but the Almighty was 
gracious and the 20 increased to 30.'' 

To this incident is due the custom at Hindu weddings of curtaioino' 
off a room in which sweets are placed, a Brahman, sitting behind the 
curtain, being trusted to dispense unbounded hospitality. Moreover 
Kumhdrs still supply ascetics with earthenware gratis.

S64 The Hindu Kumhdrs. 

The Hindu Kumli^rs of the south-east Punjab are divided into two 
main groups Mahr and Gola, the Jatter being inferior. Mahr wives 
wear no nose-ring. 

The origins of the Mahrs and Golas are variously described. The 
word Mahr has given rise to several folk-etymologies. One, which is 
somewhat widespread in the south-east Punjab, avers that once during 
a famine a Kumhar woman left her home and in her wanderings lost her 
infant son, who grew up and, returning home, married his own mother 
in ignorance of their relationship. But the truth came out, and so 
their children were called man-har, or ' mother-stealer.' But Mahar 
is also traced to mahr, ' venerable ' or ' chief '; and, in Jind, where the 
Mahrs claim to be the pure descendants of Kuba bhagat, to tnaur, 
* crown.^ 

There are, however, several other groups in Gurgaon, viz., the Hanslia, 
Tanur,^ Mali and Rdj Kumhd,r. Of these the last named work as 
masons and thus hold a superior position, the higher Hindu castes not 
disdaining to drink water drawn by them. In the Ndbha account are 
noted a Baldia,t a Hateliaj and an Agaria group, each termed khdnp. 
In Sirmur, Nahan tahsil, we find the Mahr sub-caste only, the Golas 
not being found there,§ though they are found in Paonta. 

The Hindu Mahr gots\\ include one or two names of some interest. 
For instance : — 

According to a tradition current in Lahore the forebear of the Mahar 
Kumhars had four sons ; to the eldest of whom he assigned the task of 
sifting the brick dust, whence he was called vSangroha ('sifter') : to 
the second son he entrusted the wheel with its tholepin (kila), whence 
Kilia : the third sliaped the wet earth and brought out the ends (nok), 
whence Nokhal: and the fourth dried them, whence Sokhal, from sukh, 
' dry/ These now form four gots. A Rajput of the Sarohi got brought 
up a boy and married him to his daughter, but then discovering he 
was a Kumhdr disowned him and his wife. Sarohi is also said to mean 
out-caste. So too among the Golas || we 6nd the Jalandhra got which 
is so called after Rupd., a hhagat of Devi, who was born in the water 
{jal). It is the chief got of the Gola group in Lahore. 

In Kapurthala, Amritsar and, generally speakiug, in the Punjab 
north of the Sutlej the Mahi-Gola classification is unknown. The 
principal got in the central Punjab is the Dol, but there are many 
other sections.^ 

To the list of Hindu Kumhd-r gots^ may be added the Utradhi, in 
Mult^n, whose females used to wear the nath. They are shop-keepers 
by trade and do not make pottery. They abstain from eating meat. 

* The Tanur gots are Khangar, Khotia, Mah^walia and Rai Badar. 

I The Baldia are so called because they live by carrying earth on halds (bullocks). They 
do not act as servants, and are not found in the N4bha State. 

X The Hatelia are so called because, unlike the others, they do not make earthenware on 
a wheel but by hand. They are not found in Nabha and do not act as servants. 

§ The Mahr women in Sirmur wear the nosering, which the Golas do not, but the 
Thera sub-caste, which is the highest of the three, also Avear it. This Thera group is not 
mentioned elsewhere.

Kumjidr groups. 5 65 

In Gurddspur the Hindu Ghumdrs are divided into two groups, one 
claiming descent from R^ja Sain Pdl, a Rajput, who had seven sons : — 

1. Ghuman. 

2. Ojha. 

3. Tatla. 



6, Haljhal '^ Who became potters. Their 
f descendants avoid marriage 
I inter se, because they were 

7. Tak J true brothers. 



4. Machchana. 

5. Kahlon, who became a cultivator and 

thus a Jat by caste. 

The Territorial Groups. 

The Kumhars of Sirsa are divided into the Jodhpuiia, from Jodhpur, 
who use the furnace or hhatti and are generally mere potters, and the 
BiHneri orDesi, from Bikaner who use kihis ipajdwas), but are chiefly 
agricultural and look down upon the potter's occupation as degradino-. 
In Hissdr there are four nondescript groups, the Biddwati, Magrcclii, 
Nagori and Bhandia and others. All these appear to be really "differ- 
ent tribes and not separate clans of one and the same tribe or caste, as, 
though all smoke and eat together, they will not intermarry. Of these 
the first-named smoke with Jats, and take wives from the Rugrachi, 
but will not give them brides in return. Other groups mentioned in 
accounts from this District are the Gola, Maru and Mula, all three dis- 
tinct and not intermarrying. But other accounts make the Gola the 
same as the Maru and the Bidawati identical with the Maorechi. 
Several of the Kumhdr tribes have abandoned pottery and taken to 
agriculture as an occupation and have thus risen in the social scale. 

Other territorial groups of the Hindu Kumhdrs are : — 

1. Bd,gri or Marwari,* q. v. 

2. Bd,ngar(u) a sub-caste, found in Kapurthala, originally immi- 

grants from the B^ngar. 

3. Desi.* 

Occupationally, the Bdgri group is also sub-divided into Khapm^rus 
or agriculturists and Kbapbandas or potters, wliish form sub-castes 
as they do not intermarry, or eat or smoke together. They avoid four 
gots in marriage. The Marwaris ol the Bagar use camels at weddino-s 
as they keep camels instead of donkeys. Besides Guga, they also alfect 
Jin Devi, whose shrine is on a hill near Jaipur. Fairs are held there 
on the 8th and 9th sudi of Chait and Asauj. 

The Mdrwari-Desi groups appear to be found only in Jind, and in 
Sid;lkot. 

The Kumhars of Kangra appear, however, to be also known as Desi 
and their women wear gold nose-rings. Their gots are Danid,l, Gan- 
gotra and Sohal. In Maler Kotla the Pajawagars are said to be Desi 
there being no Marwaris in the State, and this Desi group is further 
sub-divided into Mahrs and Golas. In Jind these two sub-divisions of 
the Desi group are also found, the Mahr being also called Maru. 

The Occupational Groups. 

The Kumhd,rs are also divided into several occupational groups, 
viz. : — 

{i) The Agaria or Aggaria (a synonym for Kuzgar, q. v.) who are 
found in Nabha, where they form a bans without gots, and 



* For a full list see Appendix. 



666 Kumhdr occupations. 

avoid near kin in marriage. Claiming to be of higher rank 
than the other Kumh^rs, they wear the janeo and cook 
their food in a cJiauh. 

{ii) The Kundgar, or makers of kunds (troughs or tubs), in JVU- 
lerkotla, when they are all of one got, the Aggarw^l, and 
say they came from Agra. They claim Rajput extraction 
and are often called Panjpire as they worship five pirs—- 
Piran Pir, Guga, Khwdjd-jf, Devi and Nigd,ha. 

{in) The Kuzgar, found in Jind, Nabha (where they are also 
called Agaria), Kangra, Sirmur, Multdn, and Maler Kotla 
(where they are all Sdlvahan by got). They make huzas or 
small vessels and claim Chhatri origin. [See Agaria {i) 
supra] . 

{iv) The Nungars or salt-workers are found in Jind; and in Multdn 
where they are known as Nundris and used formerly to 
make salt, but they now deal in charcoal. 

{v} The Pajdwagar or kiln-burners, found in Mdler Kotla where 
they make bricks and have two groups — Marwari and 
Desi. 

{vi) The Shoragar, found in Jind, and in Shahpur, are makers of 
saltpetre, but hardly form a distinct group. 

The cults of the Kumh^rs offer many points of interest. Thus in 
Delhi the Kumhars worship all the deities, and all, Hindus too appa- 
rently, especially affect Tabar Pir, as well as the Khwdja of Ajmer ; 
and in the amdwas of xVsauj they visit the shrine of Shams Khan at 
Nano-al-dewat in Delhi. The goddess is also worshipped, her devotees 
o-iving chdrim^etc., to the poor in her name. In Maler Kotla the Hindu 
Kuzegars invoke Pir Dastgir,* the Piran Pir, before beginning work, 
making a diva or earthen lamp in his name, to ensure the safety of the 
things made. In Nabha the Kuzegars again invoke Ghuldm Qadir 
Muhi-ud- Din Jildni and other Muhamraadau saints, though they are 
Hindus. At Aveddings too they make offerings to piVs, etc., and dis- 
tribute rice cooked with sugar among Muhammadan beggars, tha 
brotherhood, and people of their own quarter. 

In Dera Ghazi Khan the Kumhars, who are all Muhammadans, affect 
the Taunsa Pir. 

In Lahore the Kumhars celebrate the Holi with more enthusiasm 
than any other caste. Their principal shrines are those of Rdm Sahai, 
«tV of Ronecha in (?) Lahore, and of the pir of Narar, a village in 
the district of Rincha Charanan in the Khetri fief of Jaipur State. 

The Nararwala pir also has a shrine in Hateli, a village in (?) Ndbha, 
whence the Kumhdrs migrated into the Amloh nizdmat of Ndbha. 
When a child is I5 months old they carry it to his shrine, where they 
offer I5 sera of malidd and this is also distributed among the brother- 
hood. The mother is then taken to a well to draw water, carrying 
with her some hakli (boiled grain) for distribution among children. 

^ Dastgii ia also the 'pir of the Kashmiri (MuhammadaD) Kumhars in Gurdaspur. 



The Muhammadan Kumhdrs, 567 

When the child is 6 months old they offer sweets to the goddess at 
Kd,ngra. They also worship the chah at the Holi and Diwd,li festivals. 

The Kumhars in N^blia, both Golas and Mahrs, affect Bhairon and 
Guga especially. And in the Bawal nizdmat they play the tahla or 
drum, an instrument invented by them and used by Rupisar KumMr, 
an attendant of Devi, with whom he used to play chess. In an 
assemblage of Kumhdrs one of the caste assumes female attire, and dances 
and sings while the others perform music. Kumlidrs sometimes act 
as bards, and as such associate with Bahruj)ias, though they consider it a 
disgrace to play the drum for prostitutes. The Kumhd-rs express joy 
by a curious dance, in Lahore. 

The Kumhdrs, both Gola and Mahr, of Bdwal worship Sati once a 
year, and also at weddings, by putting rice cooked in milk on a piece of 
plastered ground, where the women bow their heads in reverence. A 
bride is bound to ride on an ass at her wedding under penalty of ex- 
communication. In Amloh the Gola Kumhdrs do not wear red clothing 
at weddings. Those of other nizdmats bring the bride in a cart. 

The Kumhdrs of Bdwal perform a child's first tonsure at Bhairon'a 
shrine at Bds in Gurgaon, and to this shrine a bride and bridegroom 
are also taken with their garments tied together, to offer sweets and 
cash in lieu of a he-goat. 

In Kangra the Kumhdrs have no saints of their own, except the 
potter's wheel, chdk, which originated in Gorakh Nath's gift to them of 
his mundar or earring for a wheel. Ever since it has been worshipped 
at the Diwdli, and on that day Kumhars cease from work, make offer- 
ing to the chak in fulfilment of vows, and, if a goat is slaughtered 
sprinkle its blood on the wheel. When a chah is revolved for the first 
time some sweet porridge [karah] is offered to it. If a man has no 
children or if they die young he vows his next child to the chak, to 
which solemn offerings are made if his prayer be heard. The chak is 
also worshipped by Rajputs of the higher groups. 

Few Kumhdrs are true Sikhs, but some are followers of Ndnak or his 
disciples. Thus in Amritsar the Sukhal Kumhdrs acknowledge the 
authority of the mahants of Tejiwald and Rdm Dds, who are disciples 
of Bdbd Budha, Nanak's disciple, and these mahants come to con- 
gratulate them on the birth of a son, receiving presents in return. 

The Muhammadan Kumhdrs. 

The Muhammadan Kumhdrs also have two territorial groups — Desi 
and Multdni in Mdler Kotla, Jind and Ndbha. The Desi women 
wear a gown (pahan) over the trousers, which hangs from the neck, 
while the Multdni women wear a petticoat. Desi women believe in 
Sitla, but not so the Multdnis. 

In Gurddspur the division is into Panjdbi and Kashmiri : in Sidlkot 
a^nd Gujrdt into Kashmiri and Desi. 

The Muhammadan Kashmiri sections in Gurddspur and Sidlkot 
are : — 

Chang, in Gurdsispur ; Parar, in Sidlkot ; Sadji, in Gurddspur ; Shaikh 
in Gurddspur and in Gujrdt, in which latter district all Kashmiri 



568 KumMr guilds, 

Kumli^rs claim to be Shaiklis and have no other sections. As these 
Shaikhs do not dance or sing they have to employ Desi Kumhars for 
the purpose. 

The Muhammadan Kumhdrs have no occupational groups of import- 
ance, the only one of interest being the Kuldls,* in Gujrd,t, who are 
professional singers and dancers by trade, giving performances at 
Kumhdr weddings. Though looked down upon by the other Kumhdrs 
they obtain brides from them. 

In Mi^nwali, Leiah tahsil, certain groups are alluded to but not 
defined. These are : — 

1. Angam or ? Eangam") 

2. Baryar ^ which intermarry. 
Kangam or ? Angam ) 

In Midnwdli the Kiimhdrs are cultivators as well as potters, and a 
few are bards or musicians to the land-holding tribes. The latter are, 
however, looked down upon. In Leiah the Kumhdrs claim descent from 
JaMl Bakri,t the saint, whom they invoke in beginning work in the 
prayer :— 

Dddd Jaldl Baqri, Hdji Gilgu, 
Allah kare, so ho.X 

But in Bhakkar they affect Shdh Husain Bakhsh of Peshd,war. 

In Amritsar Luqmdn is said to be the ancestor of all the Kumhd,rs, 
and on beginning work he is invoked by saying :— 

Bismilldh-^ul-Rahmdn'ul'Rahtm hu ustdd Luqmdn Hakim Hdji 
Gilgu. 

Jaisi Allah kare so ho ; dhar thoha, ydni chald chak ko. 

Galgu is the fir of the Punjabi (Muhammadan) Kumhdrs in Gurdds- 
pur and of the caste in Shdhpur. In Multan Hdji Gulgu is the ' priest* 
of the Kumhdrs, and at weddings they offer Ke. 1 and 6 yards of red 
cloth to the jhandirs (standard-bearers§) appointed for the purpose, in 
his name. 

In GujrdnwdU the Muhammadan Kumhars are said to believe in the 
Prophet Daniel and to begin work by pronouncing his name. 

The Muhammadan Multanis affect a saint at Sdradna in Patidla, 
while the Desis visit the well-known shrine of Sddhaura in Ambdla. 

Caste Administration. 

The Kumhdrs have a somewhat elaborate system of caste govern- 
ment. Thus in the south eastern districts, the Kumhdrs have chaun- 
<?*as at each large town or city, e. gf., at Delhi, || and to this place all 

* Kolal (?) is said to be a contemptuous term for a Kumh^r in Lahore. The Kolal is a 
got of the Mir4sis and its members are mirdsis to the Kumhars, though they sometimes 
work as Kumhars also. 

t In Dera Ismail Khan, however, they claim descent from Mfr Ratal. 

t H4ji Gilgu is here explained to be the perfect saint who could fulfil all desires. 

§ They say the jhar.dirs are the khaJifas of their priests. 

II The Delhi c/iaiff/n-i' used to attend all important meetings in Gurgaon, but he is now 
said to have appointed (subordinate ?) chandhris in towns and villages. 

There is also said to be a chaudhii for each group of villages. 



Kumhdr guilds. 569 

disputes, unless tried on the spoh, are brought for trial before a 
panchdyat. Each chauntra has its chaudhn, whose ofRce is not usual- 
ly hereditary, and he presides over the panchdyat. 

The chaudhri visits any village in his chauntra at weddings, funerals 
or other gatherings. At a wedding he receives a rupee, some ghi 
and a little fruit. If the chaudhri of any other chauntra attends he 
receives sweets and ghi. If not present in person the chaudhri gets 
only Re. 1 in cash. This money is earmarked for the expenses of the 
whole community or its panchdyat. A chaudhri can impose a fine of 
Bs. 100 or even excommunicate an offender. Among Hindu Kumhdrs 
the chaudhri gets a turban or 4 copper coins at a wedding or a kdj. 
In Gurgaon he receives Re. 1 and a turban at a wedding or Mj j and 
decides disputes relating to contracts of betrothal or marriage, innova- 
tions in custom, and judges co-habitation with a woman of another 
caste. As a punishment he can 6ne the offender or compel him to 
entertain the brotherhood. 

In Kdngra the Kumhd,rs had their gaddi, or head-quarters at some 
place in the south, long since forgotten. Under native rule they also 
had a book, called panchnatd, which proscribed the wedding rites and 
in which the names of the married pair were registered, the elder 
[chaudhri) receivingr annas 8 as his fee, but the practice has fallen into 
disuse. The chaudhri is elected and his powers are limited. He is 
first consulted in regard to questions of betrothal^ etc., and if necessary 
he apparently adjudicates upon them. 

In Jind and Ndbha the oflBce of chaudhri is either hereditary or elec- 
tive, but in the latter State the Kumhars have chiudhris of their own, 
independent of Hiss^r. In Sirmur, the Mahr Kumhd.rs of Nahan 
have panchdyats, and a chaudhri at Ambdla, but the Mahrs and Golaa 
of Paonta have a chaudhri or chauntra at Buria, in Amb^la District, 
and he is subordinate to the chaudhri at Kalait. At a funeral he re- 
ceives a rupee and a pagri, but at a wedding only the hhdji^ (sweet- 
meats, etc.), is divided by (? shared with) the chaudhri nothing else 
b.-ing paid him. Offences against the brotherhood are punished^ by 
fine, the offender being summoned by the chaudhri before a panchdyat. 
The chaudhri has a wazir, nominated by himself, who addresses the 
panchdyat on the chaudhri'fi behalf. The panchdyat's finding is re- 
ported by the wazir to the chaudhri and if he concurs the matter is 
settled. If not, it is again debated by the panchdyat. The chaudhri s 
office is usually hereditary, and cannot be given to another family with- 
out consulting the chaudhri and the panchdyat. 

The Multd,ni Kumlidrs of Mdler Kotla have only a loose system of re- 
ferring disputes, especially those relating to marriages, to arbitration 
by the elders of the sub-caste. But the Desi sub-caste in this State has 
an ancient system of administration. The chaudhri, who lives at Basi in 
Patidla, holds a sanad bestowed on him by some ruler, which confers on 
him authority to decide disputes within the caste. This sanad descends 
from father to son. At weddings the chaudhri gets Re. 1 and & pagri y 
which is presented to him personally or sent to him through a mirdsi. 

The panchdyat system is found, more or less developed in I^ahore, 
Amritsar, Gurddspur, and Gujranwdla. 



570 The Kunddh-panthis. 

In the south-west of the Punjab the chandhri is called 7nehtar, and 
is elected from the family in which the office is hereditary. He 
settles petty disputes in the caste and attends weddings and funerals, 
receiving a double share of the hhdji. His son as successor ia installed 
by the community by tjing a tui-ban on his head. In MMnwd,lij 
however, the system seems to be in complete abeyance. 

West of the Indus we find the mehtar exercising a large authority 
i-n Isd Khel. In Peshd,war he is termed kalantar, and he decides 
disputes, but his chief duty is or was to assign the tasks required of 
the Kurahd,rs under the Sikh system of forced labour. 

Kiimhdr dress. 

In Kdngra the Hindu Desi Kumhd,r women wear a nose-ring of 
gold. 

In Md,ler Kotla the Mahammadan Multd,ni Kumluir women wear 
a ghagrd (petticoat) and the ndth, but these are not worn by the 
Desi women, who wear instead an angid or bodice. In NAbha the 
Desi women wear over their trousers a j)o]ian, which hangs from the 
neck, the upper part forming a bodice. The Multilnis wear a gown. 

In Maler Kotla'^ the Mahr wives wear the ndth, whereas those of 
the Gola sub-caste do not, and in Ndbha they do not bore the nose. 
The Mahr women in the latter State also wear loose trousers below the 
gown. 

In MuUdn the Hindu Utradhi females used to wear a gold ndth. 
The Muhammad.an (Multanis mostly) Kumh^ir females wear the 
pairdhan or chola through life, as a rule, but some of them, chiefly 
the Kalai or Kailai, who are found in Bahawalpur, replace the chold by 
the cJioli after marriage. 

In MidiUvv^li tahsil girls assume the chola after marriage. In Leiah 
Kumhdr women wear any ornament save the nose-ring and those 
worn on the feet. 

The Kumh^rs give their name to Kumh^rsain, one of the smaller 
Simla Hill States. The State was founded by Pah^r Singh, one of 
four Brahman brothers from Gaysi, who had a pet cat which was 
killed by a mouse that sprang upon fhei' from beneath one of the 
18 potters' wheels thpn at work at Kumhilrsain. He complained to 
Koteshai't Mah^deo, who is said to be the owner of the chiefship 
{gaddi),and the god promised him redress. So all the Kumh^rs were 
killed, except a pregnant woman and her descendants still live in the 
State. 

Ki^ndAh-panthi. a sect, founded some 40 jears ago by H^kim Singh 
of R^mpur, in Patiala. H^kim Singh was described as an insignificant 
looking man, living in filth, and possessing a few tracts and a New 
Testament in Paujabi (which he had obtained from American Mis- 



* And also in Jind, where the ndth is said to be of gold or silver. In this State it is also 
added thai the Mahrs use waggons at weddings, whereas the GoLas, both men and women, 
mjist ride asses on such occasions. Golas themselves beat drums, which Mahrs will 
not condescend to do, at a wedding.

slonaries at Ludhid,na), from which he used to read to his few followers; 
but they soon numbered about 3,000 souls, and included several well- 
to- do inhabitants of Rd,mpur. His preaching too underwent change, 
and he taught that the Briiish Government would shortly be replaced 
by his own. Giving himself up to religious meditation as a lad, 
Hd,kim Singh who was a Ja^, wandered about for several years as a 
faqir visiting shrines in different parts of the country, in the belief 
that, by so doing, he would atone for his past sins and obtain merit 
in the eyes of God. Then he settled down at his native village and 
began to preach the worship of the Neh Kalank Avatar"^ or spotless 
incarnation of the Deity, He obtained some Christian books from 
the missionaries at Ludhiana and declared that Christ was the Neh 
Kalank, and that he was himself an incarnation of Christ ; the Imam 
Mahdi expected by Muhammadans, and also the Raghnath believed 
in by Hindus. He taught his disciples to eat together and called his 
sect Kunddh Panthi, kiinddh meaning an earthen vessel, and imnth, 
a sect).t He enjoined strict morality, and declared that the Satyug, 
or era of truth, was about to commence. While acknowledging 
Christ was the true Guru, he maintained that he himself was an 
incarnation of Christ, and that it was for hira to baptize. 

Originally a disciple of one Thartpuri, a sddh of his own village, 
for 20 years H^kim Singh did not come out of his house. He had 
his head shaved and also those of several women. To avoid obeying 
the calls of nature, he used to put a stick down his throat after 
eating and so cause himself to vomit. This was called neuli karam. 
He was believed to possess the power [called joga hhids) of being able 
to hold his breath for a longtime without showing any sign of life. Ho 
was a great-opium eater and when visitors called on him the first thing 
he offered them was opium. 

KuNDi. — (1) A Patban tribe of the same descent as the Nidzi. The 
original Kundi country consists of a tract lying along the Sohali 
stream below the Bhittani range in the Tdnk tahsil of Dera Ismd,il 
Khd,n. The tribe is loathe to emigrate and herds together in its old 
villages, and all their eastern villages have been occupied by immi- 
grants from Marwat. The Kundis are a Pawinda tribe, but settled in the 
district about the same time as the Daulat Khel Lohani. The Kundi 
are or were a lawless tribe and great robbers, and the proverb ran : 
" Better a dead Kundi than a live one." (2) See also under Isperka. 

KuNDU, a tribe of Jats descended from Kundu, a Rajput, who married a 
Jdt widow by kai^eiva and so lost status. It is found in Jind tahsil. 
(See under Phog^t.) 

KoNJiANWALA, a sect oifaqirs, said to practise divination by means of keys. 
They appear to come from Sidlkot and are found in Jhelum. They 
are probably Rawals.

as sahzi-farosh is the Persian, for green-grocer. Tliebigmen generally 
use the latter term, the small costermongers the former. But in no 
case is it a caste. The KunjrS, belongs as a rule to one of the castes 
of market gardeners which have been described under miuor agri- 
cultural tribes. I do not know 'vhy Kunjrd, should have been returned 
under that name only in the eastt. It may be tliat in other parts of 
the Province it is more usual to call the seller of vegetables an Ardin 
or Bdghban, as the case may be, and that the word Kunjrd is little 
used. This probably is the true explanation, as the figures for Native 
States show the same pecuharity. 

KuPCHANi, a Baloch sept, now represented by only a few families in 
Bhakkar tahsil. 

Their tradition is that they fled from Persia into Balochistan, 
whence they were expelled by the Marri, Bugti and K3,hiri Baloch. 
But they «lso say that they are an offshoot of the Qaisarani tribe 
of Sanghar tahsil in Dera Ghazi Khfin whrjse chief is stated to keep 
their genealogical tree. In the east Kachhi of Balochistdn the 
Marris, Bugtis and Kd,hiris all say that prior to their advent into 
that tract it was held by a people called Kupchd,ni of Jdt origin 
or status. This tradition lends support to the theory that Balochistdn 
was once occupied by Jats, who were driven out by the Pathan, Brahui 
and Baloch.

spread over the eastern parts of Hindustd^n and the Deccan. * Of 
good caste is the Kunbin, with hoe in hand she weeds the fields 
together with her husband.' But in the cantonments of the Punjab 
the Kurmis are generally occupied, like other Furbias, in cutting 
grass, weaving and serving as grooms ; and they are even said to 
keep pigs. They are, of course, a very low caste ; lower far in social

KtJT, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. 

KuTANA, for Kurtana or Knrutana. — The term for a Muhammadan Chuhra 
in the south-west Punjab and equivalent to Musalli in the north-west. 
The Kurtana are a class of sweepers, converted to Islam, who are 
settled on the bank of the lower Indus and have given up scavenging 
and eating carrion and taken to making ropes and working in 
grass and reeds. The word is sometimes applied to any Muhammadan 
sweeper, but, strictly speaking, only a convert who has become a 
haldUklior or eater of things permitted by the Muhammadan law, is 
a Kurtana. Some Kurtanas even cultivate land on their own account ; 
and, so long as they do no scavengering, the Kurtdaas are admitted 
to religious equality by other Musalnid,ns. Possibly the Kurtdnas of 
the Indus banks are a distinct caste or people from the Chiibras, but 
they return no large tribes and appear to be a caste formed from the 
debris of numerous tribes degraded by function. In the south-west 
the term Khoja is also applied to a converted sweeper and is thus 
synonymous with Kurtdnas, which literally means * flogger ' or exe- 
cutioner : see foot-note to p. 183, supra. 

KuTHEALOj a sept of the Bhattia, descended from Kuthrdl, son of Bhoni, 
and found in Sidlkot.
