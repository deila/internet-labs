PREFACE 

This volume is the outerowth of an iiivestiwa- 
tion begun in the year 1897, ^'i*^ carried on at 
intervals to the present time. While the move- 
ment of the Encrlish and Welsh Quakers to 
Pennsylvania has been treated to some extent by 
historians, that of the Irish Quakers has been 
overlooked, and it was with the hope of filling, in 
a measure, this deficiency that the present work 
was undertaken. 

It has been my endeavor to give a plain, orderly 
presentation of the facts, without embellishment ; 
and I have deemed it of greater interest to let the 
contemporary records, as much as possible, tell 
their own story. The inequality of treatment in 
portions of the book is due partly to variation in 
the materials ; at one point they are abundant and 
at another scanty. In Part I., I have attempted 
only an outline of the early history of the Quakers 
in Ireland ; the full history is yet to be written. 
An abundance of material for such a study lies 
buried in the manuscript records of the Society in 
Ireland, and it is to be hoped that some one will 
be sufficiently interested to prepare a thorough 
and systematic treatise upon the subject. The 
propriety of introducing so much genealogical 
matter in the Appendix may be open to question, 
but I find justification in the belief that this ma- 



vi Preface 

terial will have a special interest for many of Irish 
Quaker ancestry. 

While I have endeavored to be careful and 
painstaking, yet by the very nature of tliis work, 
drawn as it is from many sources, errors and 
omissions are likely to occur ; and I shall be very 
glad to receive corrections, so that they may be 
noted in a standard copy of the book to be placed 
in the collection of the Historical Society of Penn- 
sylvania, or incorporated in a possible future 
edition of the work. 

I desire to express my grateful appreciation of 
the kindness of the many persons who have as- 
sisted me in various ways in connection with this 
work ; especially would I mention Professors Wil- 
liam I. Hull and John Russell Hayes, of Swarthmore 
College, to whom I have been indebted through- 
out for helpful criticism and kind encouragement. 
In no less de<jree am I under obliration to Gilbert 
Cope, of West Chester, Pa., for valuable sugges- 
tions and for material from his unrivaled private 
collection of manuscripts relating to the early 
history of Chester County. 

My thanks are also due to Howard M. Jenkins, 
of Philadelphia ; to Professor Arthur Beardsley, 
Librarian of I'riends' Historical Library of .Swarth- 
more College; to John W. Jordan, A.M., and the 
other courteous officials of the Historical Society 
of Pennsylvania ; to Professor John Bach Mc- 
Master. of the University of Pennsylvania ; to

mer, of Chester, Pa., Henry Mendenhall, of Media, 
Pa., Morgan Bunting, of Darby, Pa., William 
Woodman, of Buckmanville, Pa., and Kirk Brown, 
of Baltimore, Md. 

Nor must I neglect to make acknowledgment 
of the many courtesies extended to me in the 
course of my researches in England and Ireland 
during the summer of 1900. At the British Mu- 
seum and at the Bodleian Library I received kind 
attention. To Isaac Sharp, Secretary of the Soci- 



viii Preface 

ety of Friends, I owe thanks for his kindness in 
o-ivino- me access to the areat collection of Friends' 
books at Devonshire House, Bishopsgate Street, 
Without, London. 

In an especial measure do I wish to express 
my appreciation of the kind interest and generous 
hospitality accorded me in Ireland. I am indebted 
to William Moore, K.C., M.P., of Moore Lodge, 
County Antrim, who received me most cordially 
at his pleasant seat, and in every way possible 
befriended my investigations ; to John Pim, J. P., 
of Belfast, who freely opened to me his rich stores 
of notes on the early Friends of Ireland ; to Jane M. 
Richardson, of Moyallon House, Gilford, County 
Down, author of Six Getierations of Friends in 
Ireland, for kindly reception and valued criticism 
upon parts of my manuscript ; to William D. 
Braithwaite, Head Master, Joseph Radley, formerly 
Head Master, and Frederic Bell, Secretary, of Ul- 
ster Provincial School, Lisburn, for much courtesy 
and valuable information ; to John Bewley Beale, 
for opportunity to examine the Friends' records in 
the Meeting House in Eustace Street, Dublin ; and 
to Henry F. Berry, M.A., of the Public Record 
Office, Dublin, for permission to search the records 
in his care. I also received kindly attention in 
Paris at the Bibliotheque Nationale.

The regular Friends' meetings are no longer held in this build- 
ing but in a modem meeting-house near by. In early days this 
meeting was called Grange near Charlemont, but now it is known 
as Grange near Moy, or Dungannon, County Tyrone. 

By deed of September 9, 1755, Lord Charlemont leased the 
burial ground and meeting-house land near Charlemont to 
William Greeves and T. Greer, evidently in trust for the Society 
of Friends.

CHAPTER I. 

THE RISE OF QUAKERISM IN ENGLAND 

HE period of the Civil War and Common- state of Eng- 
wealth in England was one of contro- !^°fj!°*f^^ 

o Middle 01 the 

versy and upheaval. The introduction of seventeenth 
the Bible into every cottage of the land had ^^ "^ 
set the people to thinking, and they gave them- 
selves up to the consideration of questions of 
civil and religious liberty and to the solution of 
the great problems of life and death. Puritanism 
became a mighty power, and in the middle of the 
seventeenth century it arose in all its strength 
and freed the nation from the yoke of Episcopacy 
and from the tyranny of Charles I. Under the 
Commonwealth and Cromwell toleration existed in 
some measure, and there was greater opportunity 
than formerly for the development of such sects as 
that of the Society of Friends or so-called Quakers. 

The histor)' of the early years Beginnings of 

of the Society of Friends is the Q"^''^"^" 

histor)' of its great leader and 

founder. George Fox (1624-169 1) 

was born at Drayton-in-the-Clay, now known as 

Fenny Drayton, Leicestershire, England, in 1624. 

He says, "My father's name was Christopher Fox ; 




4 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

George Fox }^g ^^^g •\^y profcssion a weaver, an honest man. 
. . . The neighbors called him Riq-hteous Chri- 
star. My mother was an honest woman ; her 
maiden name was Mary Lago, of the family of the 
Lagos and of the stock of the martyrs."' At an 
early age Fox had a " gravity' and stayedness of 
mind not usual in children,"' and as he grew up, 
under good home influences, he came to know 
" pureness and righteousness " ;' so truthful and so 
determined was he the that it was a saying among 
his associates, "If George says ' Verily' there's 
no altering him."- 

In 1643, as a youth of nineteen, "graceful . . .in 
countenance," stalwart and "manly in personage,"^ 
and with a bright piercing eye he left his home, 
and spent the next five years wandering from sect 
to sect,weighing and considering the religious opin- 
ions which obtained in that seething and fervid 
time ; but with all his seeking he seemed unable 
to find anything that appealed to his spiritual con- 
dition. Finally, after much conflict of spirit, he 
became convinced that the true source of religious 
comfort and consolation is the "Inner Light," the 
voice of God speaking directly to each human 
soul without the aid of any earthly mediator. 
With this idea as the basis of his religious sys- 
tem, George Fox developed those doctrines and

practices peculiar to the Society of Friends and 
felt himself divinely called to proclaim this mes- 
sage to the world. 

In 1647 and 164S, amid the conflictino- ideas of ^'^ ^^°'''^ 

^' ^ "^ . and 

the time, he began to preach, and went forth with Followers 
all the ardor of a youthful knight of the Crusades, 
sans peur et sans reprochc, spreading his new doc- 
trine of the " Divine Lioht" throucrh the towns 
and shires of England. He appealed to judges 
and justices to give righteous judgments, and to 
inn-keepers to be moderate in the sale of drink. 
He petitioned Parliament against allowing more 
inns than were needful for travelers. He raised 
his voice against wakes, feasts, sports, and plays. 
He went to fairs and markets urging men to deal 
justly and to speak the truth. He went into the 
"steeple houses" and openly testified against a 
" hireling ministry " and formalism of worship, the 
churches in which he spoke being usually those 
belonging to the Independents, who allowed dis- 
cussion after the sermon. For these and other 
peculiar testimonies, so foreign to the ideas of the 
time, he was subjected to the most severe and 
cruel persecution ; but not even years of confine- 
ment in dark and loathsome dungeons could 
restrain his dauntless spirit. 

The first years of his ministry were spent chiefly 
in the midland counties, where he found but few 
assistants in his missionary work, but when he 



6 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

reached the northern counties many were con- 
vinced, and by 1654 he had organized a band of 
sixty traveling- ministers, who had caught his 
spirit and who had began to preach his doctrines. 
This zealous missionary band of young si^irits — 
yeomen, tradesmen, gentlemen — went up and 
down the land carr^-ing the message of Quakerism 
with such power and courage that thousands 
llocked to their standard, and by the end of the 
century, 60,000 Quakers were numbered in Eng- 
land.'

CHAPTER II. 

THE CROMWELLIAN SETTLEMENT OF IRELAND 

DURING the relq-n of Oueen Mary, there The 
, , r '^ , r • 1 Plantations 

had been adopted, for the first time, the 

plan of clearing off the native tribes of 
Irish from whole districts of Ireland, by expul- 
sion or extermination, to make room for Eng- 
lish and Scotch setders. But the natives re- 
sisted and defended their homes with despera- 
tion ; and from the beginning the settlers had 
to fight for their newly acquired possessions, 
aided, however, in their work of extermination by 
Government forces. During the twent>' years 
from 1556 to 1576, plantations were attempted 
in the present Queen's County and County An- 
trim ; but though the planters committed fright- 
ful atrocities, both attempts in a great measure 
failed.i 

By far the most successful of all the plantations 
was that made by James I., who confiscated six 
counties of the Province of Ulster, and then 
poured in English and Scotch colonists, giving the 
natives only the poorest land to live on.- The

new settlers were an industrious class of farmers, 
mechanics, weavers, and laborers ; ' and soon 
farms, homesteads, churches, and mills rose amidst 
the desolate wilds. " The foundations of the econo- 
mic prosperity which has raised Ulster high above 
the rest of Ireland in wealth and in intelligence 
were undoubtedly laid in the confiscations of 
1610." " This confiscation met with no opposition 
at the time from the evicted Irish, who sullenly with- 
drew to the lands which had been left to them.- 
The "earth tillers," the lowest class, however, in 
this, as in the other plantations, were spared and 
allowed to live in peace, scattered among the colo- 
nists.^ Further confiscations were made in the 
Province of Leinster, under James; and Charles 
I. and his agent, Strafford, continued the work."* 
These confiscations and plantations were carried 
on for about a century and a half, and were the 
chief cause of the great rebellion of 1641.'^ 
TheGreat After the departure of Strafford from Ireland in 
1640, the natives all over the county were in a 
state of dangerous exasperation, due partly to the 
spread of the plantation system and partly to the 
measures taken to suppress the Catholic religion.*

Rebellion of 
1641 



The Crovnvelliaii Settlement of Ireland 9 

The disbanded soldiers of the army that Straftbrd 
had raised, spread over the country, and blew the 
smouldering disaffection into a flame. A conspir- 
acy, organized with wonderful power and secrecy 
by the Irish, broke forth in Ulster, and spread like 
wildfire over the center and west of the Island. 
Dublin was saved by a mere chance ; but in the 
open country the work of murder went on un- 
checked. Great numbers of the settlers were 
butchered by die Irish, and die most dreadful out- 
rages were perpetrated.^ The estimates of those 
who were slain var)- all the way from 50,000 to 
200,000. The real number was probably less 
than 5,000.'- \\\ England a cry for bitter vengeance 
arose, but, the Civil War breaking out, the troops 
were detained for home service, and eight stirring 
years, which witnessed the fall of the Monarchy 
and the rise of the Commonwealth, had passed 
before active measures could be taken for the sub- 
jugation of Ireland.^ 

Meanwhile, the turn of e\ents in Ireland had Cromweiiin 
brought the Irish Catholics and the Royalists into 
power, and to subdue them the Parliament of the 
Commonwealth sent over Cromwell as Lord Lieu- 
tenant, in 1649, to reduce the country to obedi- 
ence. " We are come," said Cromwell on landing

at Dublin with his "New Model," "to ask an ac- 
count of the innocent blood that hath been shed, 
and to endeavour to bring to an account all who 
by appearing in arms shall justify the same." ' 
From Dublin he marched to Drogheda, and the 
storminof and taking- of that stronghold was the first 
of a series of awful massacres. This was followed 
by the terrible slaughter of Wexford. The fate 
of these two towns produced such terror that 
town after town surrendered. Finally, in the 
spring of 1650, seeing the island almost subdued, 
Cromwell sailed for England, leaving Ireton, his 
son-in-law, to finish the war. Ireton and his suc- 
cessor, Ludlow, followed up the work with savage 
effectiveness, and by 1652 the conquest of the 
country was complete.* 

In 1642, just after the rebellion, the English 
Parliament confiscated between two and three 
million acres of Irish soil. Debenture bonds were 
issued, payable in land when the country should 
be re-conquered. Bonds for a million acres had 
been taken up, and money had been raised on 
them for the payment of troops sent to Ireland pre- 
vious to Cromwell's arrival. Similar debentures 
were issued afterwards for Cromwell's own army, 
though not thrown on the market like the first, 
but given to the soldiers in lieu of their pay ; and

The Cromwelliaii SettlemeJit of Ireland 1 1 

now that the Island was subdued, the time had 
come when all these eno-ag-ements were to be 
redeemed.^ To accomplish this end, to prevent the 
intermixture of the Teutonic and Celtic races, which 
had been a result of the previous plantations, and 
to remove all cause for future Irish rebellions, Par- 
liament, in 1652, passed an act to dispossess the 
Irish landholders. The whole of the population 
of the three provinces of Ulster, Leinster, and 
Munster, except the poorer sort — small farmers, 
tradesmen laborers, etc. — were ordered to trans- 
port themselves across the River Shannon into the 
Province of Connaught, where they were to be 
given small allotments of grround that had been 
left waste. The exodus, for the most part of the 
middle and upper class, across the Shannon, went 
on from 1652 to 1654. Later, however, many of 
the exiles returned to their old homes, forming 
bands of outlaws or " Rapparees,"- and from their 
lurking places in bogs, mountains, and forests, 
made the most cruel depredations on the colonists 
whenever opportunity offered. The lands vacated 
by the Irish gentry were given to Cromwell's 
officers and soldiers, and to other bondholders. 
Under the direction of the Lord Lieutenant, 
Henrjf Cromwell, son of Oliver, the great Crom- 
wellian plantation was begun. The soldiers were

settled down regiment by regiment, troop by troop, 
company by company, almost on the lands they 
had conquered. Many of them, however, sold their 
lands to the incoming Protestant pioneers from 
England and Scotland. The Irish poor classes 
remained in their natural homes, as under-tenants, 
or farm servants to the settlers. The order and 
industry of the new owners soon changed the 
face of Ireland, and it began to wear a look of 
quiet and prosperity. -^ 

The Cromwellian Settlement, and the odier 
plantations which preceded it, bear the closest 
relation to our subject, for they virtually prepared 
the ground for the planting of Quakerism in the 
Island ; and it was from these Protestant planters 
and soldiers, almost entirely, that the first Quaker 
missionaries to Ireland drew their recuits.

CHAPTER III. 

THE BEGINNINGS OF QUAKERISM IN IRELAND 



T 



HE founder and leader of Quakerism in wimam Ed- 
Ireland was William Edmundson (1627- """ ^°° 
1 71 2), one of Cromwell's soldiers. He was 
born at Little Muso-rave, in Westmoreland, Enor- 
land, in 1627, the son of John and Grace Ed- 
mundson. " My father," he says, "was well ac- 
counted among- men who knew him and relicrious 
^ in what he knew." 

'^ ii^S^\^^ ^^^0^^''^'^ — * His parents died while 

he was quite young, 
and he was bound an apprentice in York to learn 
the carpenter's trade. Then, he relates, "I went in England 
into the Parliaments' Army, and there continued 
part of the War betwixt the King and Parliament ; 
and when that was over, I went into Scotland 
under Oliver Cromwell in the year 1650." He 
was greatly influenced by the Puritan movement of 
the time, and during his apprenticeship and army 
life his mind was often exercised over religious 
questions. " Sometimes when I had been on Ser- 
vice most of the Day, and was lying down in my 
Tent at Night, then would arise in my Mind the 
eminent Dangers I had passed that Day, and the 

13 



14 Itmnigration of the Irish Quakers 

narrow Escape my Life had, and what would be- 
come of my Soul, if I had fallen. 

In the Year 1651, the Scotch Army marched 
for England, we followed and engaged them at 
Worcester, and overthrew their Army." He was 
at the taking of the Isle of Man, then returned 
to England, and was quartered in Derbyshire, 
where at this time " the common Discourse of 
all Sorts of People was of the Quakers," but he 
did not have an opportunity of hearing any of them 
preach at this time. "After some Time spent in 
divers Exercises, we marched again for Scotland, 
at which Time I had a Charge of some Men for 
recruiting other Companies in Scotland, then left 
the Army, came back to England, and \isited my 
Relations in the North ; from thence rode in- 
to Derbyshire, and married a young woman, to 
whom I was contracted before.' After some time 
I was about to settle in Derbj'shire in the way of 
Shop-keeping, at which Time my Brother, [John] 
who was a soldier in Ireland, came into England 
to see his Relations and highly commending Ire- 
land, pursuaded me to go and live there, which I, 
with my wife, concluded to do."- 

' William Edmundson was first married to Margaret Stanford, of Bram- 
ley, Derbyshire, daughter of Thomas Stanford. She died in l6gl, at the 
house of hersonin-law, William Fayle, near Dublin, and William Edmund- 
son was married a second time, 10 Mo. I, 1697, to Mary Strangman, of 
Mountmellick Meeting. — Records in possesion of a descendant, Joshua Wil-

Taking with him a stock of goods to commence seuu-s in 
a "Trade in Merchandise," William Edmundson, ^'''''""' 
his wife, and servant took shipping at \Miitehaven 
and landed at Dublin in i6s2. On learnine of 
his brother's arrival, John Edmundson came down 
from the north of the island, where his troop was 
then stationed, and transported William and his 
household to the town of Antrim. Here William 
rented a house and opened a shop, his brother 
living with him. Trade being then very brisk, 
the goods were soon disposed of, and in 1653 
William returned to England to renew his stock. 

On coming into the north of England, he says, 
" George Fox and James Naylor were in that 
country, James Naylor having a Meeting about 
three Miles from where I was, I went to it with 
my eldest brother, Thomas, and another Kinsman, 
having an earnest Desire to have Converse with 
some of that People, retaining a Love for and be- 
lieving well of them from the first hearing the Re- 
port of them, and I was glad of this Opportunit}', Becomes a 
and we were all three convinced of the Lord's " 
blessed Truth." Having accomplished his busi- 
ness in England, he returned to Ireland, and in 
the spring of 1654 removed with his family from 
Antrim to Lurgan, in the County of Armagh, 
where he kept a shop and took some land for 
grazing cattle. In his new home the use of the 
plain language, the keeping on of his hat, and

the Other peculiar Quaker customs which he had 
adopted since his convincement, were the cause 
of much wonder and offence to his neighbors, and 
socially and in his business relations he was sub- 
jected to much vexation and discomfort. 

His wife and brother had been convinced of the 
principles of Friends shortly after his journey to 
England and they all now met together in a meet- 
ing twice a week at his house. He says, "In a 
while after four more were convinced ; then we 
were seven that met together to wait upon God, 
and to worship Him in Spirit and Truth." Thus 
in the year 1654, at Lurgan was established the 
first meeting of Friends in Ireland.^ 

Now came a period of earnest and zealous 
proselyting on the part of missionaries from Eng- 
land. The first of the ministers to arrive were 
Miles Halhead, James Lancaster, and Miles Bate- 
man, who came over from England in the early 
part of 1654, and made a short tour from town to 
town through the Island, preaching to the people, 
to magistrates, and to officers of the army. Having 
convinced many of the truth of their principles, 
they went into the north and took shipping at Bel- 
fast for England.- 

The next year was an important one in the his- 
tory of the Society of Friends in Ireland. Ten

earnest preachers came over and laid the found- 
ations of the most important Quaker strongholds 
in the island. John Tiffin was the first to arrive. 
He came to William Edmundson'sat Lurean, and 
during his sojourn of five or six weeks many mem- 
bers were added to that meeting. He and Wil- 
liam Edmundson went to neiehborinor fairs and 
other public gatherings, explaining their principles 
and carrying on discussion with those of other be- 
liefs. "Truth began to spread, tho' thro' great 
opposition ; for now the Priests and People began 
to be alarmed in a rage, and Friends were exposed 
to great Sufferings upon several accounts, particu- 
larly, as the testimony of Truth was against all 
hireling Teachers and their forced maintenance, 
these made it their business to incense the Maeis- 
trates and Rulers against Friends." ^ 

About this time William Edmundson went over Richard 
to England and conferred with George Fox, whom ''yfj^f"'^ 
he had not yet seen, telling him of the convince- 
ment of Friends in Ireland, "of the Openness 
among People in the North of that Nation, to hear 
the Truth declared, and of the Want of ministering 
Friends in the Gospel there."- Soon after his 
return to Lurgan, Richard Clayton came on a 
religious visit from England, and the two spent 
several days journeying on foot through the coun-

ties of Antrim. London derr)-, Tyrone, and Armagh. 
At Coleraine they preached in the streets, but the 
people drove them out of the town, so that they 
had to lodge in a cabin on the mountain. At 
Londonderry' and Kilmore they met with better 
success, and at these places many were convinced 
and meetings were settled. 

About the year 1655 two women ministers from 
London. Anne Gould and Juliann Wastwood, 
landed at Dubhn and " all on Foot in Winter 
Time, wadinor Rivers, and dirt\- mir\- Wavs."' 
traveled in relisfious service to Londonderry, from 
there to Coleraine and through the countr)- of the 
"Scotch People and Presbyterians" to Clough. 
Here the poor women sank down exhausted and 
disheartened, and Anne Gould was confined to 
bed. But William Edmundson happening to come 
that way. they were so rejoiced at seeing liim that 
they recovered sufficiently to be taken to his home, 
where they were well cared for until their depart- 
ure for England. 

William Edmundson had now gained more ex- 
perience as a minister, and traveled continually, 
preaching in pubHc places and in churches. Other 
meetings sprang up, and " People more and more 
were convinced, insomuch that the Priests and 
Professors still raged, many tender people leaving 
them ; and to revenge themselves the)- cast Wil-

was soon liberated, however, and came forth wvHa. 
even greater zeal than before. Soon after his 
liberation, he felt a religious calling to leave shop- 
keeping and to rent a farm in order that he might 
set the example of bearing testimony against 
tithes, for as yet no one had borne that testimony Edmundson

was founded and many converts were made in that 
neighborhood. It was not long before these 
Friends experienced the sufferings they had an- 
ticipated. Many of them, for non-payment of 
tithes and other non-conformities, had their g-oods 
taken from them and were imprisoned.- 

But the Quaker movement was not confined to 1 
the north of Ireland. At the same time that Wil- 
liam Edmundson and his co-workers were spread- 
ing Quakerism through Ulster, other missionaries Leinsterand 
were working mth equal zeal in the pro\"inces of ^^^^'^ '"

Lord Mayor, in Newgate. After their release 
they had a meeting at the house of Richard Foukes, 
a tailor, near Polegate. This was the earliest 
meetinir of Friends held in Dublin, althouo^h the 
first established meeting in that city was at George 
Latham's near Polegate. From Dublin these 
faithful women traveled south into Munster, hold- 
ing meetings in the towns through which they 
passed. At Youghall, among numerous converts, 
were Captain James Sicklemore and Lieutenant 
Robert Sandham, two of the Cromwellian soldiers 
stationed in that town. Elizabeth Fletcher and 
Elizabeth Smith were the first Quakers to enter 
Cork, and in that city an equal success attended 
their efforts.

out in company with a cornet of the army, and 
others, for the dangerous journey to the south ot

cities ; for generally the country is without in-

They went toge ther tothe church, where Francis 
preached and where Edward Cook invited the 
people to a meeting at his house that evening. 
Many attended this meeting and there embraced 
the principles of Friends.^ 

At Kinsale, a great port town, Major Stoding, 
Governor of the fort, was kindly disposed, and 
numbers of the soldiers became Friends. Many 
meetings were held in the garrison, which so en- 
raged the "priests" that they informed against the 
officers and sent to Dublin for a warrant orderino- 
the arrest of the Quakers. The Governors of 
Kinsale and Cork, however, having a friendly re- 
gard for Francis Howgill, did not enforce the 
warrant and allowed him to ofo on with his work 
unmolested. For his encouragement of the 
Quakers Major Stoding, shortly afterward, was 
dismissed from the "commission of the peace" at 
Kinsale. Colonel Phayre, Governor of Cork, 
seems to have been especially impressed with 
Friends, for in a letter from Cork, Francis How- 
gill writes to Margaret Fell at Swarthmore Hall, 

' Among those convinced at Bandon at this time was Thomas Wight 
(1640-1724), son of Rice Wight, minister of the town of Bandon, and 
grandson of Thomas Wight, also minister of the same town and originally 
from Guilford, in Surrey, England. Thomas Wight is to be remembered 
as the first historian of the Irish Friends, having compiled an excellent 
contemporary " History of the Rise and Progress of the People called 
Quakers in Ireland," from 1653 to 1700. His manuscript was revised 
and carried down to the year 1751 by Dr. John Rutty (1699-1775), a 
Friend of Dublin, and a native of England, who published the work in 
Dublin, in 1751. (See Rutty in Bibliography.)

met Francis again after a separation of several 
months. In company with James Sickelmore 
and Edward Cook, they went to Limerick and 
attempted to speak in the Church, but were 
rudely driven out of the city. As they rode 
through the streets, Edward Burrough preached 
on horseback, and outside the city gates, he and 
his companions had an opportunity to speak to 
the orreat multitude that followed them. Richard 

o 

Pearce, an apothecary, and others of the city, 
became Friends as a result of this preaching, and 
a flourishing meeting was established. The min- 
isters now returned to Cork, but the " priests " 
Howgiiiand had been so active durinor their absence that both 
Howofill and Burroug-h were arrested and carried 
to Dublin by order of Henry Cromwell. As they 
were conducted on the way, the guard of soldiers 
were kind to them and allowed them to hold meet- 
ings in the towns through which they passed. 
After seven months of active work they were 
finally banished from Ireland and compelled to

consequences of his cruelty to her people. Her 
message seems to have had some effect, for Cap- 
tain Rich, at whose house she was staying, told 
her that the Lord Lieutenant " was so troubled and 
so melancholy that he could not go to Bowles, 
nor to any other Pastime." ^ 

The stream of Quaker missionaries continued » 
to pour into the countr}^ so that nearly two hun-

shows in his table, that during the first century of

would have destroyed us at once, or swallow'd 
us up ; breaking up our Meetings, taking us up 
in Highways, and haling us to Prison ; so that it 
was a general Imprisonment of Friends in this 
Nation." ' 

At this time Edmundson was a prisoner 
at Marysborough, but obtained a short leave 
of absence from the sheriff, went to Dublin and 
petitioned the Earls of Orrery and Mountrath and 
Sir iNIorris Eustace, Chancellor, that Friends in 
Release oj the nation might be set at liberty. He says: "I 
from Prison was close excrcised in that Service, but the Lord's 
Power gave me Courage, opened my Way to pro- 
ceed and gave Success to it ; so that I eot an 
Order for Friends' Liberty throughout the Nation, 
though they were full of Business ; and Abun- 
dance of People of all Sorts attending." On this 
as on many similar occasions, he seems to have 
exerted a strong and subtle influence over those 
in power, and we may well believe that men were 
drawn to him by his attractive qualities of mind 
and person, as well as by his strong and noble 
character. 

The persecutions, however, did not end here. 
The Church of England being now thoroughly 
established, the clergy bent all their efforts upon 
making the dissenters conform,- and Friends con-

tinned to suffer for their non-conformity until the 
Act of Toleration for Protestant Dissenters was 
passed in 1689, in the reign of William and 
Mary. During the reign of Charles II., 1660- 
1685, according to Rutty's table, seven hundred 
and eighty Friends suffered imprisonment.^ 

It was during this time of persecution that 
Thomas Loe, a gifted minister of Oxford, and at Thomas Loe 
one time of Oxford University, made one of his wiiuam 
frequent visits to Ireland, and at Cork converted ^^'^'^ '^^ 
to the principles of Quakerism the young cava- 
lier, William Penn, the great founder of the Com- 
monwealth on the Delaware.' 

By 1668, the number of Friends had so greatly 
increased that it became necessary to adopt some 
form of church government, and William Edmund- Organiza- 
son, as one of the chief instruments in g-atherinor 
and preserving the Society in Ireland, was a prime 
mover in the work of carrying out George Fox's 
scheme of organization in Ireland. Provincial 
meetings were established to be held once in six 
weeks, the chief business being to take care of 
the poor, the fatherless and the widows ; to see 
that marriages were properly solemnized ; and to 
watch over the moral conduct of the members. In 
the following year George Fox himself came over, 
and he and W^ilHam Edmundson traveled all over

the Island, establishing national half-year meetings 
and monthly meetings.^ 

Great alarm was created among the English 
and Scotch Protestants in Ireland, by the acces- 
sion of James II. and by his measures taken for 
the restoration of the Catholic religion. The 
Earl of Tyrconnel, a strict Catholic, was sent over 
as commander of the forces, and immediately 
proceeded to disarm the Protestant militia and to 
place Irish Catholics in the Army. This innova- 
tion, and later Tyrconnel's appointment as Lord 
Lieutenant, together with the efforts of the Irish 
to recover their confiscated estates, and the raids 
of the Rapparees, caused the wildest alarm among 
the Protestants, and they trembled both for their 
estates and for their lives. Rumors of a general 
massacre, like that of the Rebellion of 1641, flew 
through the land, and many of the terrified people 
left the country or hastened to the fortified towns, 
such as Enniskillen and Londonderry, where at 
the latter place the)' bravely withstood the siege 
of James in 1689.^ 

In the war that followed, the Friends generally 
kept their places and maintained their meetings.' 
In some districts, however, the danger was so 
great that members moved into the towns until 
the conflict was over.^ Those who remained were

continually being robbed by the Irish soldiers and 
Rapparees. In this, as in many other trials which 
came upon him, William Edmundson stood forth 
as the sturdy champion of his sect, and on many 
occasions went to Dublin to solicit the govern- 
ment in behalf of Friends. Tyrconnel heard him 
with attention, and measures were taken with a 
view of protecting the Quakers from robbery ; 
but such was the state of anarchy prevailing that 
no effectual remedy could be applied. As the 
Friends were known to be an inoffensive people, 
opposed to war, the Catholics in authority were 
disposed to shield them from the severities inflicted 
upon other Protestants. But, notwithstanding all 
the endeavors made, the Friends were exposed to 
great perils. Many of the lostm all of their per- 
sonal property, and some were even stripped of 
their clothino- and had their homes burned to the 
ground.^ In 1692, after the war was over, it was 
estimated that the material loss of Friends through- 

O 

out the nation amounted to ^100,000. 

After the landing of William and Mary in Eng- The Revoiu- 
land, James had fled to France, and now, with the *^°"'-°J '^^^ 
hope of recovering his lost kingdom, he was come 
again with an army into Ireland. During the 
fierce struggle that ensued, the Provinces of Lein- 
ster and Munster were ravaged by advancing or 
retreating armies, and many Friends who contin-

ued in their homes were plundered and subjected 
to gross maltreatment ; but not being classed as 
belligerents, their lives were generally spared. 
They were sometimes enabled, indeed, to per- 
form kind offices for both sides, at one time plead- 
ing for their Irish neighbors, when the English 
had obtained the ascendency, and at another shel- 
tering the Protestant English when the Irish had 
gained a temporar)' advantage. 
After Battle After the defeat of James at the Boyne, in 1690, 
oftheBoyne j^jg j^jgj^ troops disbanded, and roamed through 
the country, carrj-ing terror and devastation into 
William Ed- the Protestant districts.' William Edmundson, 
Sufferings now livmg at Kosmallis, was one ol the greatest 
sufferers in this war. In reading his quaint and 
graphic account of his sufferings and experiences 
in these unhappy times one is filled with admira- 
tion for his courage and heroism. At one time he 
is at Dublin telling James of the calamities which 
have fallen upon the Protestants, and at another 
he risks his life in pleading with infuriated English 
soldiers for his Irish neighbors. He relates that 
after the Battle of Boyne, the Rapparees burst 
into his house one night, abused his wife with such 
violence and cruelt)' that she died soon after, and 
ruthlessly seized him and his tvvo sons and carried 
them away with intent to hang them. This crime, 
undoubtedly, would have been committed if an 
Irish officer had not opportunely interfered.

After William III. had brought the nation into 
a peaceful condition, the Friends continued to in- 
crease in numbers, and during the next half cen- 
tury- many new meetings were formed. At the 
present day. although the Societ}- has greatiy 
decreased, there still remains a considerable num- 
ber of meetings, many of which are well attended. 



CHAPTER IV. 

RACIAL ORIGIN OF THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND 



T' 



Celtic-Irish 



*HE converts to Quakerism in Ireland were 
drawn almost exclusively from the English 
and Scotch Protestants. Most of them had 
previously been in membership with other non- 
conforming denominations, such as the Baptists, 
Independents, and Presbyterians, although some 
few had been members of the Church of England. 
The principles of Friends in early days found 
The little acceptance with the Celtic-Irish, nor has the 

Society acquired much increase in after years from 
that source. For, aside from race differences and 
antipathies, arising from the EngHsh plantation 
system, the Irish almost to a man were Catholics, 
and as Beck says : "It seems to need the passing 
through the various stages of non-conformity, be- 
' fore a Catholic can appreciate the doctrinal views 
of Friends."' During the early period, at least 
prior to i 700, I have been unable to find in Stock- 
dale, Rutt)', Besse, Sewell, Leadbeater, or in the 
journals of ministers, any instance of a Celtic- 
Irishman becoming a Quaker. Of Besse's two

Quaker sufferers in Ireland, from the rise of the 
Society to 1689, there is not one Mc or otheir/ 
Celtic prefix ; all are old English names.^ 

Although the statement of Joyce - and Prender- 
gast, that the Cromwellian settlers were absorbed 
by the Irish in two generations, may be true to a 
large extent of the other Protestants, it is, I be- 
lieve, by reason of the strict church discipline 
which obtained, but slightly true of those who re- 
mained in the Society of Friends.^ Apropos of 
this, John Grubb Richardson (181 3-1890), a 
prominent and representative Irish Friend, says 
of his family : " We were members of the Society 
of Friends, our forefathers having been convinced 
by the preaching of William Edmundson in 1660. 
All our ancestors came from the north of Encrland 
in Cromwell's army, and received grants of land 
from him to settle in Ireland."'* 

In the migration of the Irish Quakers to Penn- 
sylvania, there were represented only five sur- 
names with the Celtic prefix M'^ — McCool, 

^Besse, II., 457-493- 

^Traill, IV., 343. 

' Rutty states in his table of meetings in Ireland [Rise and Progress, 
page 350) that between 1714 and 1739 a small meeting was established at 
Connaught, the province to which the Irish were expelled in the Cromwel- 
lian Settlement, and it is possible that the members of this meeting were ot 
Celtic- Irish stock, but unfortunately I have been unable to find any data 
bearing on the point. I am able to state, however, from my examination 
of Friends' records of Pennsylvania, that no members from this meeting 
came over during the emigration period, 16S2-1750.

McMollin, or McMillan, McClum, McNabb, and 
McXice ; but, as this prefix is common to both 
Irish and Scotch surnames, it is unsafe to use it as a 
means of distinction. The McCool and McMollin 
families were from Ballinacree Meeting, near Bal- 
lymoncy. County Antrim, in the midst of the 
"Scotch country," hence if any distinction can be 
made, it lies in favor of the Scotch or Scotch-Irish 
descent. The McClums were from County West 
Meath ; the McNabbs from County Meath, and the 
NcNices from County Cavan, localities in which 
the Scotch had also settled, although not in such 
o^reat numbers as in the more northern counties. 
The only Quaker family with a distinctively Irish 
name, that came over to Pennsylvania, was that of 
(the O'Mooneys, who came from Ballinacree Meet- 
ing, and settled at Sadsbury, Lancaster County. 

In a letter of 1898,^ John Bewley Beale, an 
Irish Friend, writes : " There were additions from 
the pure Irish stock to the Society, but much 
fewer in number than from the Protestant settlers 
and their descendants. We have some Irish 
names amongst us still, such as Murphy, Mac- 
quillan, etc." This view is confirmed still further 
by Joseph Radley, until recently Headmaster of 
Ulster Provincial School, the P'riends' School, at 
Prospect Hill, Lisburn, Ireland. He writes (May 

' From Dublin, dated 3 mo. 5, 1S9S. Kor many years J. Bewley 
Beale has had charge of the Friends' records collected at Friends' Meet- 
ing House, 6 Eustace Street, Dublin.

7, 189S) : "The Quaker character found little on 
which it could be grafted in the Celtic population. 
This was almost entirely Roman Catholic. Con- 
sequently, but few names of the old Celtic families 
occur now amongst Friends. A few O'Heils, Mc- 
Quillans, etc., still are to found." During my 
travels in Ireland, in the summer of 1900, I heard 
similar views expressed by many other Irish 
Friends, notable among whom were John Pim, 
J. P., of Belfast, for many years a student of the 
history of Irish Friends, and Jane M. Richardson, 
of Moyallon House, Gilford, County Down, the 
author of Six Generation of Friends in Ireland. 
My own conclusion is, that the increase from the c 
Celtic or Hibernian stock was very slight indeed, 1 
and that such converts as were made were ob- 
tained after the great migration to Pennsylvania. 1 

The Scotch Presbyterians had come over in The 
great numbers to the north of Ireland during the '^"^'^ ""^ 
spread of the plantation system, and at the time 
of the Cromwellian Settlement constituted the 
largest part of the Protestant population of Antrim, 
Down, and some other counties of Ulster. The 
early traveling preachers of the Friends report in 
their journals that the meetings in the "Scotch 
country " were well attended by the Presbyterians. 
There is no evidence, however, that any consid-i 
erable number became Friends. J. Bewley Beale 
says in his letter : " There were also some Ulster 



36 Iminigratioii of the Irisli Quakers 

Scotch amongst the early Friends, but I think the 
proportion was also small." 

Quite early, meetings were established at Col- 
eraine, Ballynacree, Lisburn and other places in 
Antrim, but they were not as large as other meet- 
ings without the pale of the Scotch. Thomas 
Stor^',^ in his account of a religious visit to Ireland 
in 1 716, relates that at Grange in Antrim great 
numbers of the Presbyterians came to hear him, 
and that one of their ministers, Moses Cleck, edu- 
cated at Glasgow, Scotland, had been convinced 
of the Quaker principles. Prominent among 
Scotch-Irish Quakers were John Chambers, a min- 
ister of Dublin ; Alexander Seaton, of Hillsbor- 
ough, County Down ; Archibald Bell, of Shankill, 
County Armagh ; Patrick Logan, of Lurgan, 
County Armagh, and his son, James Logan, later 
one of the most distinguished statesmen of colo- 
nial Pennsylvania. 

(We may safely say that the great majority of 
the Quakers in Ireland were English, or of English 
Anglo-Irish jescent. Long after the Cromwellian Settlement, 
and well into the first half of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, Quaker colonists continued to come from 
England. Some of these were members when 
they arrived, and others became members after 
their settlement.' The certificates of removal

which the Irish Friends brought to Pennsylvania 
show that many of the emigrants were natives of 
England and had lived but a few years in Ireland. 
It is especially interesting to note that so many of 
these early Irish Friends had been officers and 
soldiers in Cromwell's " New Model," and that 
the same splendid zeal and courage shown at 
Naseby and Worcester, but now directed in a 
peaceful cause, contributed so largely to the up- 
building^ of Quakerism in the nation. 



PART II. 

THE MIGRATION OF IRISH FRIENDS 
TO PEXXSYLVAXIA 



T 



CHAPTER I. 

CAUSES OF EMIGRATION 



HERE was but little foreign immigration of introductory 
Quakers into the colonies of New England, 



New York, and the South during any pe- 
riod. The Society in these provinces was com- 
posed, for the most part, of converts and the de- 
scendants of converts made during the period 
from 1656 to the end of the seventeenth century 
by that zealous band of Old World missionaries 
under the stirring and effective leadership of such 
men as George Fox, John Burnyeat, and William 
Edmundson. In the distinctively Quaker colonies 
of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, however, the 
Society was made up almost entirely of immigrant 
Friends from Europe attracted by the superior 
opportunities for settlement. 

While it is true that the majority of the Quaker 
settlers of Pennsylvania came from England and 
Wales, it is also true that a considerable body of 
them were immigrants from Ireland, who took a 
prominent and useful place in the affairs of the 
Province and rendered an important contribution 
to the makinor of the State. Historians hitherto 
have overlooked this feature of the early immigra- 



41 



42 Iinniigyatio)i of the Irish Quakers 

tion, but it is one that deserves in the fullest 
measure their close attention and study. 

The Irish Friends removed to several of the 

American colonies. At an early date they were 

on the eastern shore of Maryland. In 16S2 a 

shipload of them came to West Jersey.^ They are 

also known to have orone to the Quaker settle- 

ments in the Carolinas,- and Virginia.^ But by far 

I the greatest and most important migration was 

/ that to Pennsylvania during the period 1682 to 

1750, and it is this movement that we are now to 

consider. 

Causes Although the causes which led to the migration 

are well known, it seems fitting, if only for the sake 

of completeness, to enumerate and briefly discuss 

^ them. The religious persecutions were powerful 

factors in the movement, and duringr its first stag^es 

gave to it its greatest impetus. Later, however, 

' These Friends were from in and near Dublin, and having purchased 
an interest in West Jersey, they chartered the ship of the adventurous 
Quaker captain, Thomas Lurting, and sailed from Dublin the latter part of 
September, 16S2. In about eight weeks they arrived at Elsinburg, near 
Salem, New Jersey, and made a settlement in what later was called the 
Irish Tenth, in Camden County. Here was established Newton Meeting, 
first held at the house of Mark Newby, one of this company. A full history 
of the Irish Friends of the Newton settlement is given in Judge John 
C\eratn\'% StctchfS 0/ /he Firs! Emii;rant Settlers in Newton Township,

Causes of Emigj-ation 43 

especially after the passing of the Act of Tolera- 
tion of 16S9, by which the persecutions were some- 
what relaxed, it would appear that the economic 
restrictions had a greater influence. Then, too, 
along with these causes went that old Teutonic -' 
love for adventure, that same historic force which, 
to a great extent, inspired the V'olkcrzuandcrwig — 
the Wandering of the Peoples — of the Early Mid- 
dle Ages, which led the Angles and Saxons to 
Britain, which took the Franks and later the Nor- 
mans into Gaul, and which led to the discovery and 
exploration of the New World. 

The causes are given herewith under the two 
main heads : I. Religious Causes ; II. Economic 
Causes. 

I. Religious Causes 

The Acts of Uniformity passed at the time of Religious 
the Restoration of Charles II. continued to be en- '^^"^^^ 
forced with varying severity far into the eighteenth 
century. All the non-conformists suffered more or 
less by them, but especially the Friends and Scotch- Acts of 
Irish Presbyterians. These sufferings were re- Uni/orvtUy 
lieved in a large degree, in 1719, by the passing 
of an act which allowed greater freedom of wor- 
ship.' 

The Friends were continually persecuted for Tithes and 
maintaining their testimony against tithes. Says '^J^lYasfuai 
Rutty (p. 364), " The Priests were commonly the Dues

Instruments of stirring up the Magistrates, and 
even the Rabble against them ; and . . . they 
very frequently had their goods spoiled and taken 
away ; sometimes to three, six, ten, or tv^renty 
times the value, and were kept Prisoners several 
years, and sometimes unto Death." During the 
four years of King James II. (i 685-1 689) the 
Friends were deprived of .1^1,583 worth of goods, 
and twelve suffered imprisonment. In the thir- 
teen years of William and Mar)' ( 1 689-1 702), their 
"sufferings" included ^13,724 and thirty-three 
prisoners ; in the twelve years of Queen Anne 
(1702-17 1 4) ^16,199 and thirteen prisoners; in 
the thirteen years of George I. (1714-1727) ^22,- 
513 and twenty-seven prisoners ; and in the first

whole period from 1685 ^^ 175^ the "sufferings " 
amounted to ;^92,745 and ninety-one prisoners.^ 
OaUis The Friends were constantly inconvenienced and 
defrauded in business on account of their refusal 
to take the oath in a court of justice ; "For in- 
stance," says Rutty, " in the county of Wexford,

him from one Ezekiel Webb, was by the said Webb, 
subpoena'd into Chancer)- and because the Friend 
could not give in his answer upon Oath, he not 
only lost the said debt, but was constrained to give 
about ^70 to get clear of the Debtor."^ This form 
of persecution continued until 1719, when Parlia- 
ment passed an Act which allowed Friends to sub- 
stitute affirmation for the oath.- 

The Friends often endured the greatest cruel- 
ties and depredations at the hands of the rebel- 
lious Irish. In 17 19 one of the Irish gentr)-, Lawlessness 
lames Cotter, was hancred for an outracre com- 'if "'^ j^"''-

mitted against a Quaker family of Cork. Upon 
this, "All Cork and all the South of Ireland burst 
into a wail of rage, and the Friends were marked 
for retribution. Placards covered the walls. . . . 
No quaker could show in the streets. . . . The 
passion spread to Limerick, to Tipperar)' and at 
last over all Catholic Ireland. Quakers' meeting- 
houses were sacked and burnt. Quakers travel- 
ling about the countr)' were waylaid and beaten." ^ 
The rage against the Friends continued, until in 
1725 it culminated in the most inhuman and bar-

II. Economic Causes 

Economic CroiTiwell had placed English and Irish com- 

causes merce on an equal footing ; but early in the reign 

of Charles II. an Act was passed, with the result 

that all export trade from Ireland to the colonies 

I was forbidden, as was also the import of Irish 

Restriction ' Cattle into England. Dreadful distress all over 

on Manu/ac- j^eland followcd immediately, for the people could 

ture and _ •' ^ ' 

Comvterce find HO market for their produce. When the cattle 
trade ceased, much of the land had been turned 
into sheep walks. A large and increasing woolen 
trade and manufacture now sprang up, so that it 
became one of the chief industries of Ireland ; 
whereupon the English merchants, fearful for 
their own trade, in 1699, succeeded in having 
I passed an Act which forbade the export of woolen 
goods from Ireland, and thus ruined the wool 
trade of the Island. About 40,000 industrious 
Protestant workmen were thus thrown out of em- 
ployment and reduced to poverty ; 20,000 of these 
emigrated to America. Many of those that re- 
mained suffered all the misery of famine. Sub- 
sequently, almost all branches of Irish industry 
were interfered with and suppressed by England. -' 

As an example of this distress, may be cited

the Irish Friends who came over with his famil)' 
to Philadelphia about 1 709. In his certificate of 
removal, signed 5 jNIo. 26, 1709, the Friends of 
Cork say, " y" sayd Samuel being a bristall [Eng- 
land] man came over into this Country' with his 
wife som time after y'= Wars ended to settle in 
Corke and follow y" Cooping trade and although 
he was observed to be a Laborious painful man

trey where we suppose Avorkmen of that Calling 
are no so plenty as in this nor materials to worke 
on so hard to be obtained as here.'"- Aeain, the 
Friends of Waterford, in a certificate, dated 2 
Mo. 13, 1 71 2, sent to Philadelphia, for William 
Moore, say, "A great Reson of his Removeall is for 
want of a good Imploy his trade being bad here."' 

At times the landlords became very^ oppressive, High Rents 
raising the rents all they possibly could, regard- 
less of what the tenants had done to make the 
land valuable. Much land was held on lone 
leases, and when these expired the rates of re- \ 
newal were made almost prohibitive, many tracts ' 
of land being secured by the Celtic-Irish, who were 
ready to give almost an)' price to recover posses- 
sion of the soil.- The Friends of Cork, in a cer-

The majority of the Friends of Munster and 

many of those of Leinster lived in the cities and 

Failure of towns ; but those of Ulster were largely farmers 

crops, and ^^ yeomcn, and were directly affected by the 

Famine •' / 

memorable failure of crops in the year 1729. 
I Famine and sickness prevailed in that year 
throughout the whole of Ulster. In spite of aid 
from their brethren in England and in other prov- 
inces of Ireland, the Friends of Ulster suffered 
severely,- and it was evidently this calamity that 
caused the Pennsylvania migration to reach its 
highest point in this year. Crop failures seem to 
have been frequent in those times, as they are 
to-day, for in a letter that has come down to us, 
Mungo Bewley, a Friend of Edenderr)', King's 
County, Ireland, writes to Israel Pemberton, mer-

CHAPTER II. 

INDUCEMENTS THAT LED THE H^ISH FRIENDS TO 
IMMIGRATE INTO PENNSYLVANIA 

William '' I ^HE scverc persecutions to which the Friends 
nrcoTony 1 ^^'ere subjected in both the Old and the 
New Worlds, but especially in New Eng- 
land, led George Fox as early as 1 660, to suggest 
the purchase of land in America for a Quaker 
colony, where Friends' views and principles might 
be fully exemplified.^ Fox's proposition was car- 
ried out with considerable success in the Quaker 
settlement of West Jersey, but it remained for the 
broad and liberal mind of William Penn to bring 
the idea to its fullest realization in the Province of 
Pennsylvania. 

William Penn (1644-17 18), as we have seen in 
a preceding chapter, had been convinced of the 
His principles of Quakerism in Ireland, and was now 

Charter ^^^ ^f ^^^ most prominent and influential mem- 
bers of the sect. As one of the owners of West 
Jersey he had become directly interested in Amer- 
ican colonization. His father. Sir William Penn,

him a claim against the crown for sixteen thou- 
sand pounds. In payment of this he induced 
Charles II. ( 16S1 ) to give him a proprietary char- 
ter for forty thousand square miles in America. 

Penn immediately began the work of settling His Scheme 
his colony of Pennsylvania. He offered to sell °-^ 

■' ■' Colonization 

land at verj' low rates. " He proposed to estab- 
lish a popular government, based on the principle 
of exact justice to all, red and white, regardless of 
religious beliefs ; there was to be trial by jur)- ; 
murder and treason were to be the only capital 
crimes ; and punishment for other offences was to 
have reformation, not retaliation, in view. By the 
terms of the Charter Penn was, in conjunction 
with and by the consent of the free-men, to make 
all necessar}' laws.'"- These proposals attracted 
widespread attention, not only among the Friends 
and other persecuted sects, but among many en- 
terprising people who wanted to better their 
economic condition. The stream of colonists from 
many countries, more especially from England, 
Wales, and Ireland, now set in, and Pennsylvania 
was rapidly settled. 

The constitution drawn up by Penn provided ConsHiuHon 
that the proprietor was to choose the governor, /J'^^^ 
but the people were to elect the council and 
also the members of a representative assembly. 
The first assembly, called by Penn soon after his

arrival in 16S2, sustained his idea of government. 
Among other important measures, laws were 
passed providing for the humane treatment of the 
Indians and for religious toleration.^ 

Under the wise and benificent rule of Penn, 
the progress of Pennsylvania was rapid. The 
care taken to maintain friendly relations with the 
Indians spared the colonists from the cruel Indian 
warfare of New England and left them to pursue 
the arts of peace uninterruptedly. The fertile 
soil and temperate climate made agriculture the 
chief industr)-. The soil was carefully cultivated 
and gave rich returns, the principal crop being 
wheat, although there was much variet)' of prod- 
ucts. There were some small manufactories, 
and a good e.xport trade in grain, riour, and furs 
was carried on with England and the West Indies. 
So prosperous was Pennsylvania that it became 
one of the richest and most populous of the 
American settlements ; and before the Revolution, 
Philadelphia, the great market of the province, 
became the largest town in the thirteen colonies. 

With this brief account of the beginnings of 
Penn's province, let us turn our attention to 
those agencies that were directly influential in 
leading the Quakers to come to the " Promised 
Land " of Pennsylvania.

Ireland, and was often able by the use of his power 
and influence to relieve his fellow members from 
their sufferings. In 1669 he had gone to Ireland His Personal 
to settle some business on the Penn estates, but ^"fi"^" 
was so affected by the general imprisonment and 
persecution of Friends, that he left all private af- 
fairs and went at once to Dublin to work for their 
relief At the General Half Year Meeting, held 
at his lodoines in the city, an account of the suf- 
ferings of the Society was drawn up in an address 
to the Lord Lieutenant. Penn himself carried 
the document to the Castle and presented it with 
such success that Friends in prison were soon re- 
leased.^ His general work for the good of the 
Societ)% his own sufferings, his writings in defense 
of Friends' principles, but especially his travels in 
the ministn.- throuo-h Ireland, made him well known 
to Irish Friends, and they had the greatest confi- 
dence in him. They were among the first to 
whom he opened his Pennsylvania project, for. on 
March 5, 16S1, the ven,- next day after his Char- 
ter was signed, he writes to his friend, Robert 
Turner, a Quaker of Dublin, stating that his 
province has been confirmed, and adds : " Thou 
mayest communicate my graunt to friends, and 
expect shortly my proposals."-

Descriptive 1 68 1 and 1 69 1 , Were widely scattered throui^di 
Pamphlets Ireland, and the attractive accounts gave a strong 
impetus to the first wave of migration. The first 
of these pamphlets, entitled So7ne Accotmt of the 
Province of Pctmsyhania, etc., a folio of eleven 
pages, printed in 1681, contained Penn's propos- 
als for setdement and a general description of the 
countr}'. Other pamphlets went further into de- 
tails, telling of the rich natural resources of the col- 
ony, of improvements that had been made and were 
to be made, of the best kind of houses to build, 
of the ways and means of migration, and all de- 
tails that intending colonists mit^ht wish to know.^ 
The Free Society of Traders was also influential 
in the first migration of the Irish Friends. This 
Society, consisting of over three hundred mem- 
Activityof bcrs, made a purchase of twenty thousand acres 
'socfeT^of °^ ^^"^ '" Pennsylvania with the purpose of devel- 
Traders oping it." Several of the prominent Irish Friends, 
as Robert Turner and Samuel Clarridge,^ of Dub-

bers. In the letter-book of James Claypoole, 
secretary of the Society, we find a collection of 
letters to Turner, Clarridge, and others, telling of 
the acdvity of the Society, between 1681 and

ner, one of the committee of twelve at the head 

of the organization, was a wealthy Quaker mer- 
chant in Dublin, and had already been acdvely 
interested in the settlement of New Jersey. In 
1683, with his daughter and seventeen indented 
servants,- he removed to Philadelphia, where he 
took a prominent part in the affairs of the colony, 
and no doubt by his personal influence did much 
to forward the migration of his countrymen, "who," 
as he says in one of his many letters sent back to 
Ireland, "sojourn in a Land of great distress, 
wherein I have been."^

dangers incident to those primitive times, many 
letters and messages were exchanged between 
the colonists and their friends in Ireland. 
By the From the first visits of George Fox and W'il- 

Minisurs ^^^'^ Edmundson to the Delaware, before Penn 
<^nd received his grant, to the end of the eighteenth 

century, a steady stream of traveling ministers 
came over to the Province. These preachers, and 
those who had come to reside in the colony, car- 
ried favorable reports of Pennsylvania to Ireland, 
and no doubt did much to counteract false rumors 
and silence objections to migration ; for in the 
first years of the migration many Friends took a 
somewhat conservative attitude toward the Penn- 
sylvania movement and carefully examined into 
the reasons for removal, as is instanced by the 
certificate given forth by Ballyhagan Meeting, 
County Armagh, i Mo. 31, 1682, and brought 
over to Middleton Meeting, Bucks County, by the 
widow Ann Millcum and her children, who arrived 
in the Delaware on the ship Antelope, 10 Mo. 10, 
1682.^ The following is quoted from the certifi- 
cate : 

"The said meeting inquired of them the 
Ann reason why they had a mind to such a great 

Miiicum's journey, havino- no man in their family except 

CerUficate .

hood ; the said Ann Millcum replied that her 
daughter Jane had a great desire to go and 
being not wiUing to part with her, after such a 
manner, was rather willing to take her adven- 
ture with her other daughter, and so go all to- 
gether, being accompanied with another daugh- 
ter of hers, and her husband and children with 
several other neighbors also, and seeing it was 
her resolution to go as aforesaid," the meeting 
gives its consent.^ 

There were many friends also who thought that to 
emigrate was to fly from persecution and to desert 
a cause. That such views existed is shown by the 
certificate of removal brought over to Pennsyl- 
vania, in 16S3, t)y Nicholas Newlin, a gentleman 

in easy circumstances,- who settled in Concord, 

then Chester County. The certificate is as follows :

by J. J. Parker, of West Chester, Pa., I Mo. 19, 1874, from the original, 
which was in the possession of Nicholas Newland's granddaughter, Mary

West Chester, in a letter dated 2 Mo. 17, 1901, corrects this statement. 
He writes : " The Jackson Genealogy is in error where it says that John 
J. Parker copied the original Newlin certificate in 1S74, as I am satisfied 
he never saw it. In 188S I made an effort to locate the old document, but 
without success. I have two copies from different sources and have known 
of others, but believe no copy has been made from the origin.nl since 1820. 
Amongst others I wrote to Joshua Husband, Dublin, Hartford Co., Md., 
aged about eighty, a grandson of Mary Mitflin, and got a copy of a copy 
made in 1S20. He obtained his copy from some one in Washington, and 
perhaps I should have tried to trace back on this line but did not."

Ireland for _ '^ 

short I'isiis vania some years before. In 1688, Henry Hol- 
linesworth, of Newark or Kennett Meeting-, who 

had come over as a servant to Robert Turner in 
1683, returned to Ireland to marry and brought 
back his wife. In the latter part of 1713, Benja- 
min Fredd, of Concord Meeting, who had arrived 
in the early part of the year, made a business trip 
back to Ireland. Amos Boaks, of the same meet- 
ing, came over in 1734 and made two visits to 
Ireland, one in 1735 and the other in 1736. In 
1738, Chester Monthly Meeting signed a certifi-

to go to Lisburn Meeting in Ireland. Many other 
such instances could be cited. 
Favorable Then, too, numcrous Irish Friends made the 
journey merely to see the country and to visit 
friends and relatives. John Parvin came over to

West Meath, in 1725, came to "visit his father

Thomas Hutton, of Carlow, County Carlow, 
under date of 6 Mo. 20, 1726, writes to his sons 
in New Garden, that "Cousin Wm. Lightfoot tould 
me y' you dwelt in love."^ 

The number of favorable and urgent letters 
written by the first settlers back to Ireland were 
strong incentives for the Irish Friends to join their 
relatives and old neighbors in Pennsylvania. By 
the merest chance some of these letters have been 
preserved ; but from hints and references to other 
letters in those e.xtant we know that there must 
have been many others. In the meeting records, 
also, there are frequent references to letters sent 
in relation to the business of the meeting, and 
often these afforded opportunities for the exchange 
of personal messages. All these letters were read 
with the greatest interest in Ireland, and passed 
from house to house in a neighborhood, a custom 
also in Pennsylvania when letters came from the 
old home. 

These letters afford us interesting glimpses of 
the migratory movement and of the social side of 
colonial life. A few of the first letters were 
printed in the descriptive pamphlets, but the first 
manuscript letter that has come under notice is 
one to William Porter in Ireland, from Georee 
Harlan,- a Friend, who had come over from

By far the most important and comprehensive Robert 
of these letters is that written by Robert Parke l^^^J 
(1694 '5-1 736 7),of near Chester, to his sister Mary, '725 

wife of Thomas YdX- 
iTr /? Loo? u / entine', of Ballybrum- 

^±^hMJU^^^_ l^ill. County Carlow, 

and as it throws such 
a flood of light on all phases of our subject, I ven- 
ture to insert it in full. But first, a few details 
about the Parke family, by way of introduction, 
will give a better understanding of the migration 
of a representative Irish Quaker family. 

Thomas Parke (i 660-1 738), the father ol The Parke 
Robert Parke, was y^ Hi M fmi-ra/e 

a farmer and owned ^ 7^/ e/^^t^^ 

several tracts of ' ^^ 

land in Ballilean, Ballaghmore, and Coolisnack- 
tah, County Carlow. On May 21, 1724, with all 
of his family, excepting two married daughters, 
he took passage at Dublin, on the ship Sizargli, of 
Whitehaven, Jeremiah Cowman, master, and after 
a rough passage of three months, on August 21st 
arrived in Delaware Bay. Thomas leased a 
property from an Irish Friend, Mary Head, near 
Chester, as a temporar)- home, but on December 
2d, purchased 500 acres from another Irish Friend, 
Thomas Lindley, in the Great Valley of Chester 
Count)', on the west side of what is now Downing- 
town, where he removed and lived the remainder 



"o Innnigration of the Irish Quakers 

of his life. His son Robert was a clerk at Chester, 
and for some years acted as Recorder of Deeds. 
Robert died unmarried.^ The letter is as follows : 

Chester Township the — of the lo'^'Mo. 1725. 

Dear Sister Mary Valentine,^ 

This goes with a Salutation of Love to thee, 

Parke's Brother Thomas & the children & in a word 

Letter j.^ ^jj f^jg^^^jg Relations & well Wishers in Gen- 

erall as if named, hoping it may find you all in 
Good Health, as I with all our family in Gen- 
eral are in at this present writing & has been 
since our arival, for we have not had a days 
Sickness in the family Since we came to the 
Country, Blessed be god for it, my father in Par- 
ticular has not had his health better these ten 
years than since he Came here, his ancient age 
considered. Our Irish Acquaintance in general 
are well Except Tho' Lightfoot who Departed 
this Life at Darby in a Good old age about 4 
weeks Since. 

I Parke Family, in Futhey and Cope's History of Chester County, 673 ; 
A sketch of the Parke Family, by James Pemberton Parke, of Philadelphia, 
in the Chester County Journal, issued at Downingtown, Chester County, 
Feb. 8, 1S68. According to J. P. Parke, Robert Parke kept a journal of 
the passage over in 1724, and also of a voyage made back to England 
and Ireland, in 1727 ; likewise of the return voyage in 1728, when the 
list of passengers included sixty-three servants, of whom six were brought 
over by Parke himself. Unfortunately, I have been unable to locate these 
MS. journals, which no doubt would contain many interesting details of 
sea-tr.avel during the period we have under consideration.

Thee writes in thy letter than there was a 
talk went back to Ireland that we were not 
Satisfied in coming here, which was Utterly 
false: now let this Suffice to Convince you. In FaUe 
the first place he that carried back this Story '^'f'°''" 
was an Idle fellow, & one of our Ship-Mates, 
but not thinking this country Suitable to his 
Idleness ; went back with Cowman again, he is 
Sort of a Lawyer, or Rather a Lyar as I may 
term him, therefore I wod not have you give 
credit to Such false reports for the future, for 
there is not one of the family but what likes 
the country very well and wod If we were in 
Ireland again come here Directly it being the 
best country for working folk & tradesmen of a Good 
any in the world, but for Drunkards and Idlers, f;;""/^/'"'

they cannot live well any where, it is likewise an Folk

We were all much troubled when we found 
you did not come in with Capt. Cowman as we 
Expected nor none of our acquaintance Ex- 
cept Isaac Jackson & his family, tho at his com- 
ing in one thinks it Something odd but that is 
soon over. 

Land is of all Prices Even from ten Pounds, Purcha$eoj

the goodness or else the Situation thereof, & 
Grows dearer every year by Reason of Vast 
Quantities of People that come here yearly

from Several Parts of the world, therefore thee 

6 thy family or any that I wish well I wod de- 
sire to make what Speed you can to come here 
the Sooner the better we have traveled over a 
Pretty deal of this country to seek for Land 
and (tho) we met with many fine Tracts of 
Land here & there in the country, yet my father 
being curious & somewhat hard Please Did 
not buy any Land until the Second day of lo"" 
mo : Last and then he bought a Tract of Land 
consisting of five hundred Acres for which he 
gave 350 pounds, it is Excellent good land but 
none cleared, Except about 20 Acres, with a 
small log house & Orchard Planted, We are 
going to clear some of it Directly, for our next 
Sumers fallow, we miofht have bouijht Land 
much cheaper but not so much to our satisfac- 
tion. We stayed in Chester 3 months & then 
Rented a Place i mile from Chester, with a 
good brick house & 200 Acres of Land for [?] 
pounds a year where we continue till next 
May. 

We have sowed about 200 Acres of wheat & 

7 acres of rj'e, this season we sowed but a 
bushel on an acre, 3 pecks is Enough on new 
ground. I am grown an Experienced Plowman

years old Can hold Plow here, a man Comonly

nay some Plows 2 Acres a day, they sow Wheat 
& Rye in August or September. 

We have had a crop oats, barley & very 
good flax & hemp, Indian Corn & buckwheat

use 2 or 3 good falling Axes, a pair of beetle 
rings & 3 Iron wedges, for they are of good 
Service here, your Plow Irons will not answer 
here, therefore you had better bring i or 2 hun-

they are also a good Iron.

much Credit to my words & find no Iffs nor 
ands in my Letter that in Plain terms he could 
not do better than to Come here, for both his 
& his wife's trade are very good here, 'the best 
way for him to do is to pay what money he Can 
Conveniendy Spare at that Side & Engage how to come 
himself to Pay the rest at this Side & when he 
Comes here if he Can get no friend to lay down 
the money for him, when it Comes to the worst, 
he may hire out 2 or 3 Children & I wod have 
him Cloath his family as well as his Small Abil- 
ity will allow, thee may tell him what things are 
proper to bring with him both for his Sea Store 
& for his Use in this Country. I wod have him 
Procure, 3 or 4 Lusty Servants & Agree to pay 
their passage at this Side he might sell 2 & pay 
the others passage with the money. I fear my 
good will to him will be of Litde Effect by reason 
he is So hard of beleif, but thou mayest Assure 
him frorr. me that if I had not a pardcular Re- 
spect for him & his family I Should not have 
writ so much for his Encouragement, his brother

Parke's influence seems finally to have had the 
desired effect, for in the spring of 1728 we find 
Thomas and Mary Valentine presenting a certi- 
ficate of removal to New Garden Monthly Meet- 
ing, in Chester County. 

Hundreds of just such favorable letters and 
descriptions found their way to the Old W'orld, 
urgently setting forth the desirabilit)- of removal 
to America and presenting the special induce- 
ments offered to immigrants in the Quaker Col- 
ony. These pleasant pictures of the happy con- 
ditions existing in Pennsylvania — the great and 
good character of the Founder, his wise and liberal 

' The letter ends abruptly and is not signed, but it is endorsed on ttie 
back, "Letter to Mary Valentine from Robert Park, lo mo., 1725." It 
seems to be a rough copy kept by the writer. At the end of the letter is 
written in a different hand, " And several Letters with Long full of ac- 
compt of al things George Tooke or Rooke," and on the back of the let- 
ter the name of Round is scribbled several limes and the name of R. D.

laws, his cheap and fertile lands, the mild and 
healthful climate, the successful peace policy with 
the Indians which Penn adopted, and above all 
his religious toleration — filled the minds of the 
poor and persecuted of Europe with ardent long- 
intrs, and made them leave behind forever kins- 
folk and fatherland and risk all that was near 
and dear to them for the long and perilous jour- 
ney to the strange land beyond the sea. 



CHAPTER III. 

PLACES IN IRELAND WHENCE THE FRIENDS CAME 

TO make some attempt at an accurate deter- 
mination of the places in Ireland whence 
the Friends emigrated, an examination of 
records of all the monthly meetings in Pennsylvania 
has been made for all certificates of removal 
brought over by Irish Friends between the years 
1682 and 1750. With these data as a basis, 
supplemented by additional facts from authentic 
manuscripts, county histories, genealogies, and 
other works, I have compiled the following statis- 
tical table showing as nearly as possible, the num- 
ber of adult Friends that came over from each meet- 
ing, county, and province of Ireland, during the 
above-mentioned period. The meetings were not 
as careful to record all certificates of removal 
brousfht over durino- the first two decades of the 
colony, as they should have been ; but later a 
faithful account was kept. 

The table shows that from Ulster came 172 
adult members ; from Leinster 183 ; from Monster 
42 ; and from places which are not specified 
43. This makes a total of 440 adult persons 
from twenty-nine or more meetings. If, however, 

6 81 



82 hmnigration of ike IrisJi Quakers 

we count the children and the women whose 
names evidently have not been recorded, and like- 
wise those persons of whose emigration we have 
no record, we may safely estimate that at least 
between 1,500 and 2,000 Irish Friends came to 
Pennsylvania between 1682 and 1750. 

County Armagh in the Province of Ulster sent 
ninety -five colonists, more than any other county. 
Dublin Meeting sent fifty-four, more than any 
other meeting, Grange Meeting, in a country- 
district near Charlemount, County Armagh, comes 
next with forty-one ; then follows Ballynacree, an 
obscure county meeting near Ballymoney, County 
Antrim, with thirty-five. The Friends from Ulster 
and those from Leinster, with the exception of 
Dublin, were almost wholly from the country dis- 
tricts. Some few were tradespeople, but the 
majority were yeomen or farmers, and when they 
came to Pennsylvania, they bought farms and en- 
racjed in agriculture. The Quaker colonists from 
Munster, on the other hand, were nearly all 
tradesmen from the cities and towns. They, 
with the emigrants from Dublin, settled for the 
most part in Philadelphia.

CHAPTER IV. 



WAVES OF MIGRATION 



THE migration may be considered in three FUstwave 
waves. The first wave, beginning in 1682 ^ ^-^7^° 
and continuing to 1 7 10, was caused largely 
by the severe religious persecutions carried on 
against the Friends before the Act of Toleration 
of 1683 was passed. The wave was the heaviest 
in 16S2 and 1683, thirty-two adult colonists com- 
ing over in these two years. After this, the wars 
of James and William coming on, there was little 
migration until 170S. From 17 10 the stream second wave 
continued to flow steadily, reaching the highest '''"*"''^'' 
point of the whole migration in the great fam- 
ine year of 1729, when sixt)-four adults came 
over. After 1710, the economic causes of migra- 
tion were probably more potent than the re- 
ligious. 

The third wave reached its highest point in TiuidWave 
1736, when thirty-three adult settlers arrived. ^'^°'^'^^° 
From 1 74 1, the movement declined, and after 
1750 very few Friends came over to settle.

Certificate 
of Removal 



I gave at least a month's notice to the meeting 
to which they belonged, of their intended 
departure, requesting that a certificate of removal, 
certifying to their membership in the Society, be 
given them to take into the new land. If, after 
due inquiry by a committee appointed for the pur- 
pose, the applicants were found to be in good 
standing in the Society and in the neighborhood 
in which they lived, the document was drawn up 
and signed by members of meeting in due time 
for the day of departure. In many cases, how- 
ever the emigrants waited until after their arrival 
in Pennsylvania before writing to Ireland for the 
certificate. The following extract from the min- 
utes of the Preparative Meeting at Grange, near 
Charlemount, Ireland, shows the mode of pro- 
cedure in the preparation of the certificates :

embarked for Pennsylvania v/ere Be.;--;: ^^.,..:.. 7. -\.. :.

sailing directly from the Irish ports, but more 
often passage was taken in vessels which had 
sailed from Whitehaven, Liverpool, or Bristol, in 
England, and which touched at the Irish ports for 
passengers and cargo.' Philadelphia was the 
principal port of entr\', but many settlers landed 
at New Castle, on the Delaware, and some few 
at points in Marj'land and Virginia. 

At times obstructions were placed in the way obetnetkBa 
of Irish emigrants, as appears from the following *^^°^SBiiBa

Dangers of The voyage was a long and trying one, espe- 
voyage cially SO when attended by rough weather. The 
length of the passage varied all the way from six 
weeks to three months. Vessels were often 
driven far out of the course by contrary winds and 
carried as far south as the West Indies. Danger- 
ous diseases, such as small-pox, were of frequent 
occurrence, and many passengers died at sea. 
During the French W^ars, vessels were often at- 
tacked and the passengers imprisoned or sub- 
jected to loss of property and to harsh treatment. 
As an instance of this, may be cited the case of 



Wa^s and Means of Migration 93 

Samuel Massey and family who sailed from Cork 
in 1 7 10, intending for Philadelphia, but the vessel 
was seized by the French and they were carried 
off to the Island of Antigua in the West Indies.^ 
Finally, after much suffering and hardship, they 
reached Philadelphia, but so impoverished that 
they were unable to pay for their passage from 
Antigua, and Philadelphia Monthly Meeting had 
to assist them to the extent of thirty pounds. The 
French had taken even their certificate of removal, 
and Massey had to request the meeting in Cork 
to send a duplicate certificate. - 

In 1728, Robert Parke, while on the return Robert 
voyage from a business journey to England and pfajofa 
Ireland, notes in his diary^ that there were a num- voyage from 
ber of cases of small-pox aboard, several persons 
dying with it. Under date of June 11, 1728, he 
says: "This day one Margaret Darlington took 
the small pox and three of her children being

down in it. Our true course is judged to be south." 
It seems that even in those days the sailors were 
ready to exact tribute from the unwary landsman. 
On June 14th, Parke writes : "This day Samuel Ask 
and I paid our observing muggs on the fore staff." 
It is inferred from this that the sailors demanded 
a mug of grog from any one who took an ob- 
servation of the sun by means of the " fore staff" 
or "cross-staff," the predecessor of the sextant. 
Another curious incident of the voyage is thus 
quaintly recorded in the diary, as of July 3 : 

"At 12 last nitrht we seen a lig-ht riy-ht a starn 
which some caled the half way house and said, 
' There lived one Peg Trotter.' Then all hands 
were called upon deck to se the said house and 
if possible to purchase some buttermilk for the 
passengers. It caused great rejoicing among all 
hands fore and aft. It contained a light upwards 
of one hour and half. The above light we put out 
on purpose to encourage the passengers, it being 
the imitation of y* half way house. It was a 
pitched barrel fixed in a large tub." 
A Favorite One of the favorite vessels with the emigrants 
was the Sizargh of Whitehaven, Jeremiah Cow- 
man, master. The Parkes, Jacksons, and many 
other Irish Friends, settlers in Chester County, 
came over on her. Robert Parke says in his let- 
ter of 1725 : " Be sure you come with Capt. Cow- 
man & you will be well used for he is an honest

man and has Civell Saylors as any that Cross the 
Seas, which I know by Experience, the Ship has 
been weather bound Since before Christmas by 
reason of frost & Ice that floats about in the River 
& the Saylors being at a Loose End Came down 
to Chester to See us." 

The following advertisement of this vessel ap- 
peared in the American Weekly Mercury ^ a 
newspaper printed at Philadelphia, September 2. 
1731: 

"For BRISTOL directly. 

THE Ship Sizar gh, Nathan Cowma^i Master 
she being almost Loaded, and intends to Sail in 
Ten Days for the above Port, if any Persons 
have a mind to take Passage on Board the said

and be kindly used."

nal care over immio^rant Friends, advisino- them 
as to settlement and frequently rendering needed 
financial assistance, especially in the payment of 
passage money, as in the case of Samuel Massey, 
just referred to. As early as 1685, Philadelphia 
Monthly Meeting took action in the matter, as ap- 
pears by the following extracts from the Minutes : 

' Files of this newspaper are in the collection of the Historical Society 
of Pennsylvania.

9 Mo. 2, 1685. — "It being taken notice of by 
several friends of this meeting, that this meet- 
ing is greatly burthened and oppressed by the 
increase of the poor, more than any other 
place in the province by reason of people's 
general landing here, the meeting appoints Ed- 
ward Luffe to mention the same at the Quar- 
terly meeting for their conversation & advise 
for assistance." 

II Mo. 4, 1685. — "The testimony of advice 
to friends from Frances Taylor before she de- 
ceased, was read and ordered to be Recorded, 
and as to that part of her advise for counselling 
such as come over from Encrland, at their first 
arrival, what course to take, to manage what 
they bring and also relating to their settle- 
ment," a committee of thirteen is appointed " to 
Enquire as Ships come in, and as occasion pre- 
sents Give account to the monthly and Quar- 
terly meeting." 

At Philadelphia Monthly Meeting, 8 Mo. 25, 
171 1, "The widow of Mark Carlton applies her- 
self to this meetine for advice in relation to her 
affairs, being lately come from Ireland. In order, 
therefore, Anthony Morris and Richard Hill are 
desired to assist her with the best advice they are 
capable of" And, 7 Mo. 24, 1736, "A Certificate

Many of the Irish Friends who came to Penn- 
sylvania were young men just starting out in the 
world, and it was quite common for them to bring 
with them letters of introduction from well-known 
Friends in Ireland to prominent Friends in Penn- 
sylvania, requesting assistance for the young im- 
migrants in securing business positions. A letter 
of this character is preserved among the Pember- 
ton Papers of the Historical Society of Pennsyl- 
vania. John Barclay writes from Dublin, June 
I 7, 1 743, to Israel Pemberton, of Philadelphia : 

" I send this by Thos : Henderson 3d Son to 
our late Friend Patt!' Henderson^ who left a

accompanied by Samuel Wilkinson, he travelled on a gospel mission 
throughout the limits of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. " Patrick Hender- 
san," writes James Logan to William Penn, "is I think Scotch by birth, 
and is a most extraordinary young man as ever visited these parts.'' — Bcrw-

of, the Ship going away Sooner than his Mother 
& he expected, they did not aslc for a Certifi-

believe there will be one Sent after him '^. next 
Ship. He has no great stock I believe to trade 
with therefore I should think it would be advis- 
able to get him into Some Friends Counting 
house." 

The meetings in Ireland also gave assistance to 
their needy emigrant members. An instance of 
this is found in the Minutes of the Preparative 
Meetinor of Grange, near Charlemount. At the 
meeting 2 Mo. 3, 1741, "Patrick Holm & his 
wife also Hugh Kenedy & his family having Laid 
before our meeting their Intention of Removino- 
to America, they being poor friends & in want of 
help therefore this meeting agrees that William 
Delap doe Lay out y^ Sum of fiveteen pounds 
Ster : to help to pay their fraughts and other 
necessaries for y" Jurnay untill he be paid y"

W'illiam delap Thos Greer & Benj" Marshill are 
Desired to Draw Suitable Certificates for ye S"* 
Hugh Kenedy and for Jacob Hinshaw & his wife 
who Intends y' Same Journy." 

The cost of passage varied somewhat accord- 
ing to the time, but was, as Robert Parke states 



Ways and Means of Migration 99 

in his letter, about £g. Some of the ways of pay- 
ing the expense of the sea voyage are suggested 
by Parke. He says : "I desire thee may tell my 
old friend Samuel Thornton ... to Come here 
for both his & his wife's trade are Very good 
here, the best way for him to do is to pay what 
money he Can Conveniently Spare at that Side & 
Engage himself to Pay the rest at this Side & 
when he Comes here if he Can get no friend to 
lay down the money for him when it Comes to 
the worst, he may hire out 2 or 3 Children & wod 
have him Cloath his family as well as his Small 
Ability will allow, thee may tell him what things 
are proper to bring with him both for his Sea 
Store & for his use in this Country. I wod have 
him Procure 3 or 4 Lusty Servants & Agree to 
pay their passage at this Side he might sell 2 & 
pay the others passage with the money." 

It was a frequent occurrence for poor emigrants 
to sell themselves into temporary servitude, 
usually for a term of four years, in order to de- 
fray the cost of their transportation to Pennsyl- 
vania. On engaging passage the emigrants made 
an agreement or indenture with the shipmaster 
that they were to be sold after their arrival, and 
were known on this account as indented servants 
or redemptioners. It is evident from certificates of Redemptioners 
removal and other manuscripts that many Friends, 
particularly those from Ireland, arrived in this 



I oo Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

manner.^ The redemptioners could not be sold 
out of the Province without their consent freely 
given in open court or before a justice of the 
peace. At the end of their service, if their be- 
havior merited it, they received a suit of clothes, 
a set of tools of the occupation in which they were 
engaged,- and frequently a sum of money, and those 
who had come over with first purchasers were 
allowed by Penn to take up fifty' acres of land at 
a rent of one half-penny an acre per annum.^ 

Many of the Irish Friends brought over indented 
servants and disposed of them to advantage in 
the colony, where there was a great demand for 
laborers. William Pim writes in 1732, from Ches- 
ter County, Pennsylvania, to his uncles in Ireland, 
that he had lost a servant, "Jo: Gavin, by the 
small-po.x," and adds, "I am in expectation of Ja : 
Nicholson in a little time, ^, whom I expect an 
acct from Ireland & if he dont bring- me a servant 
or servants I shall be in great want, for I am soe 
now. I hired an Indifferent hand lately at Hus- 
bandry & it cost me 36' for 4 weeks (and diet)."'' 

' Mungo Bewlcy, a minister, who made a religious visit to Pennsylvania 
in 1732, in writing from Kdenderry, Ireland, to Isr-iel Pemberton, of 
Philadelphia, under date I Mo. l6, 1742-3, says : " I now Send these 
lines by the Hands of Samuel & Joshua Fayle the sons of a Poor Friend

Owino[- to harsh treatment and to dissatisfac- 
tion with their condition of servitude, the redemp- 
tioners were continually running away, and much 
of the business of the provincial courts con- 
sisted in hearing the complaints of masters and 
servants. The colonial newspapers are filled 
with advertisements of rewards offered for the re- 
turn of bond servants, such as the following^ by 
James Logan, the most eminent of the Irish 
Quakers in Pennsylvania : 

" RUN away from James Logan's Plantation 
near German Town the 28th Instant, an Irish 
Servant Lad, named Patrick Boyd, aged about 
17 or 18 years, with streight dark Hair, a 
freckled Face and a smooth Tongue, cloathed 
with a double-Breasted Pee-Jacket. a brownish 
Kersey Coat, a Pair of Leather Briches, and a 
good Felt Hat ; but he had other Cloaths with 
him. Also a fine short Fowling Piece of a Car- 
bine Length, or less. He went in Company 
with one Miles MacWard. Whoever takes and 
secures him shall be well rewarded for their 
Trouble."

PART III. 
THE IRISH FRIENDS IN PENNSYLVANIA 



CHAPTER I. 

PLACES OF SETTLEMENT 

AS the population of the Province increased 
by birth and immigration, the richest lands 
of the old settlements along the Delaware 
were purchased and placed under cultivation, with 
a resultant rise in value ; and the later comers, if 
unable to purchase the best lands, or if not satis- 
fied with the less desirable lands, had to seek out 
fertile plantations in the forest wilds beyond the 
pale of the settlements. The latter course was 
usually pursued by the greater part of the later 
immigrants, excepting those who settled in the 
towns ; for to a large extent these people had but 
small means with which to establish themselves 
in the new country. 

Although some few Irish Friends came over 
during the first decade of the Colony and secured 
good lands in the old settlements, the greater part 
of them arrived later, after the best lands had been 
seated, and having little other capital than strong- 
arms and brave hearts, the farming element in 
particular were obliged to leave behind the culti- 
vated districts and push into the wilderness to fell 
the forests and clear the land for the upbuilding 

of the frontier homes.

tbe Irish 
Friends 



[)cr cent, of the Irish Friends presented their certifi- 
cates of removal to Philadelphia Monthly Meeting 
and to the monthly meetings of Chester County, 
then including Delaware County. Chester 
County heads the list with nearly si.\ty-five per 
cent, of the total number, or two hundred and 
eighty-three adults, eighty-two of these being re- 
ceived at monthly meetings in what is now 
Delaware County. Philadelphia follows with 
twenty-six per cent, of the whole, or one hun- 
dred and seventeen adults. After Philadelphia 
Monthly Meeting comes New Garden, with one 
hundred adults ; then Kennett, formerly Newark, 
with eighty-two ; and Chester, with sixty-three. 
A large number of the Irish Friends remained 
within the limits of the monthly meetings to which 
they brought their certificates, but many of them 
made only a temporary home until a more suit- 
able location could be found. The tradespeople, 
who were chiefly from Dublin, Cork, Waterford, 
Limerick, and Wexford, naturally settled in Phila- 
delphia, where conditions seemed most favorable 
for their occupations and for their former mode of 
life. On the other hand, the farmers, or yeomen, 
who came largely from the country districts of 
Ulster and Leinster, and who constituted the 
greatest part of the migration, mostly sought out 
farms away from the towns.

Philadelphia, as the metropolis of the new Prov- Philadelphia 
ince, became better known in the Old World than 
any other part of Pennsylvania, and a large pro- 
portion of the steady stream of Quaker colonists 
which poured into the country made this city its 
objective point ; and of the nineteen monthly 
meetings established in Pennsylvania prior to 
1750, as the writer's investigations have shown, 
Philadelphia Monthly Meeting easily ranked first 
as to the number of certificates of removal re- 
ceived. 

The first Quaker settlers on the west side of 
the Delaware, within the present limits of Phila- 
delphia, attended business meetings of the So- 
ciety at Burlington, in New Jersey, but as their 
numbers increased they established a meeting of 
their own early in the year 1682, at Thomas Fair- First Meeting 

, 1 . r-L I !'■•<. at Shacka- 

man s house at hhackamaxon, now Kensington, „,„^„„ 
where in the autumn of the same year William 
Penn is reputed to have made his Great Treaty 
with the Indians. Later in this memorable year a 
meeting was founded in the city proper, and a 
temporary house of worship called "the boarded 
meeting-house " was erected. This structure, it is 
supposed, was located on Front above Arch Street, 
where afterwards the Bank Meeting House was 
built, in 1685. 

The Bank Meeting House was intended for Bank Meet- 
First-day afternoon meetings, and the Center ^"^ 



io8 Immigration of tlic Irish Quakers 

Square Meeting House, built in 16S5-86, where 

the City Hall now stands, for the more important 

Center First-day morning and business meetings ; but as 

Square Meet- j.}^g Center Square was in the midst of the forest, 

ing House , i • t 

far from the center of the town s population along 
the Delaware, the meeting was not well attended, 
the Friends preferring to wait for the afternoon 
meeting at the Bank Meeting rather than take the 
long walk to the morning meeting at Center 
Square, so that in a few years the meeting here 
was abandoned. 

In 1695 the Great Meeting House was built at 
Great Meet- the southwest comer of Second Street and High 
tng House ^^low Market) Street, opposite the spot, where 
several years later the historic Old Court House 
was placed. This meeting house with some ad- 
ditions was used until 1754, when it gave way to 
a more commodious building. Here for more 
than a century were held the most important busi- 
ness and religious meetings of the Society in the 
City.i 

The Irish Friends of Philadelphia, with the not- 
able exceptions of James Logan, Thomas Holme, 
Robert Turner, and some others, seem to have 
taken but a small part in meeting and civil affairs, 
and in associating with other nationalities appar-

ently soon lost those characteristics which had 
been acquired in their Irish environment. For 
this reason little will be said of them collectively, 
but attention will be given to those Irish Friends 
who removed to the country districts, usually to 
settle, clanlike, near each other, and who inter- 
married and for generations preserved much of 
their racial identity. 

Several families of Irish Friends produced cer- Bucks County 
tificates of removal to the Monthly Meetings of 
Falls, Middletown, Buckingham, and Wrights- 
town, in Bucks County, but they were too few in 
number to deserve further mention than is given 
in the Appendix. 

A few Irish Friends came to the Monthly Meet- Montgomery 
ings of G\vynedd and Abington, in what is now 
Montgomery County, but their number was also 
small. 

Althoutfh no certificates from Ireland were re- seika county 
ceived at Exeter' Monthly Meeting in Berks 
County, yet many Irish Friends, who had first set- 
tled in New Garden and other places in Chester 
County, removed there and settled within the limits 
of the meetings of Exeter and Maiden Creek. 
Conspicuous among these Friends were : Moses 

' The Particular Meeting of Oley, later called Exeter, was established 
by Gwynedd Monthly Meeting, in 1721, and the Monthly Meeting in 
1737- Among the first Friends to settle here was George Boone, originally 
from Eradwinck, near Exeter, Devonshire, England, grandfather of Daniel 
Boone, the celebrated Kentucky pioneer. — Howard M. Jenkins' Gwynedd,

justice of the peace and representative to the Pro-

As the table shows, eighty-two adult Irish

received at Chester Monthly Meeting, sixteen at 
Concord Monthly Meeting, and but few at the 
Welsh Monthly Meeting at Radnor, or Haver- 
ford, with its subordinate or particular meetings of 
Haverford, Radnor and Merion (Montgomery

Robert Wade, an English Friend, the first mem- 
ber of the Society to locate on the west side of the 
Delaware, settled among the Swedes and Dutch on 
the west bank of Chester Creek at Upland, later 
called Chester, in 1675, and in that year William

American colonies, held a meeting at his house.'- 
This was the first F"riends' meeting held in the 
Province of Pennsylvania.'- A meeting was prob-

several other Friends had arrived in the neigh- 
borhood.^ No doubt the First-day and mid-week 
meetino-s continued to be held at Robert Wade's 
house, known as Essex House, until 7 Mo. (Sep- 
tember) II, 16S2, shortly before the coming of 
William Penn, when the Monthly Meeting 
"agreed y' a meeting shall be held for y^ service 
& worship of god every first day at y'' court house -

was not finally accomplished until in 1693, when 
a stone structure was erected on the east bank

1675, in a Friends' Meeting, at Henry Settle's house, Harefield, in Nether-

George Maris, Joseph Stedman and Bartholo- 
mew Coppock, Jr., in Springfield ; and Caleb

meeting-houses having been erected for the par-

Providence and Middletown — the Monthly Meet-

Riding, in the County of York'] : Ilis Fine ..^20" ; and June, 12, 1670, 
at a meeting at Bainbrigg Pastures, Yorkshire, Thomas Fawcett had a fine 
taken from him (II., 123). Walter Faucett settled on the north-east 
side of Ridley Creek, his land extending to Crura Creek, and took a 
prominent and active part in civil affairs and in meeting work, being a min- 
ister among Friends. In 1685 he was appointed one of the Peace Makers 
for Chester County — then an office of considerable responsibility — and also 
served one year as a member of the Assembly. For many years Chester 
Monthly Meeting was held at his house, notwithstanding that it was kept as 
a tavern or inn for at least part of the time. His wife Grace having died 
in 16S6, he was married to Rebecca Fearne, of Darby, in 1694. He died 
in 1704, leaving two sons — John (who married Grace Crook) and Nathan, 
by his first wife ; and three daughters, Rebecca, Mary and .Sarah, by his 
second wife. In 1698 he paid a religious visit to England (Dr. Smith's 
Delaware County, 462).

his son Nicholas Fred ; and Samuel Hollings- 
worth (son of Valentine Hollingsworth), justice 
of the peace and representative to the Provincial 
Assembly.-

1683-4. it was ordered that " Chechester Monethly 
Meateing be y'' second second day of eavery 
moneth," and according to the records of the 
Monthly Meeting, "The fearst monthly meeting 
held by friends in Chichester [was] on y' 1 7''' of 
the first month, in y"" year 1684." At the Quar- 
terly Meeting, 6 Mo. 2, 1686, it was " Ordered that 
y" monthly meeting formerly held at Chechester be 
from henceforth kept one month at Chechester 
and one month kept at Concord & y" next 
monthly meeting to begin at Concord, until 
farther order." After 1729 it was held altogether 
at Concord.^ 

The meetings in New Castle County " on Dela- 
ware" received an important migration of Irish 
Friends, and although now within the State of 
Delaware, in those early days were in that part of 
Penn's possessions known as " The Territories " 
or "Lower Counties" of Pennsylvania ^ ; there- 
fore they come properly within the range of our 
study. 

About 1682, several Friends with their families 
arrived and settled near each other on the east 
side of Brandywine Creek, in New Castle County. 
Among these were: Valentine Hollingsworth, from 
Parish of Segoe, County Armagh, justice of the 
peace and for many years a representative to

the Provincial Assembly ; his son-in-law, Thomas 
Conway, or Connaway, from Lisburn, County 
Antrim ; William Stockdale,^ justice of the peace, 
probably from County Tyrone, Ireland; Adam 
Sharply,- possibly related to Ralph Sharply, of 
Belfast ; John Musgrave, from north of Ireland, 
later a settler in Lancaster County and a rep- 
resentative to the Provincial Assembly ; Morgan 
Drewett, who came from London to Burlington, 

1 Ha may have been nearly related to William Stockdale, a minister, of 
County Tyrone, who came over to Philadelphia on the ship Friendship, in 
1684, and served as a member of the Provincial Council. 

2 Adam Sharply and wife Mary were active in the affairs ot Newark or 
Kennett Monthly Meeting. Their children, Benjamin and Charity, were 
bom II Mo. 10, 1686-7. Adam died 9 Mo. 27, 1694, and was buried in 
Friends' burial ground at Newark. Rachel Sharpley, probably a daughter, 
was married about 8 Mo., 1686, under the auspices of Newark Monthly 
Meeting, to Thomas Pierson, Deputy Surveyor, of New Castle County, and 
died 7 Mo. 2, 16S7 ; burial at Newark. [Records of Nra'ark Monthly 
Meeting.) A daughter, Abagail, was married, 12 Mo. 23, 1692-3 to 
Alphonsus Kirk, and died in 1748. There was also a William Sharply, 
probably a son (authority of Gilbert Cope). 

Possibly Adam Sharply was related to one Ralph Sharply mentioned, 
by Ruttv (343), who states that a meeting was settled at Belfast about 
1671 or 1672, " and Ralph Sharpley came from England and resided there ; 
but apostatizing into evil Practices, lost his condition and corrupted others, 
which with the removal of some to America proved a means of that meet- 
ing being lost." Nodoubt this was Ralph Sharply, the Friend, of Derby- 
shire, of whom the following account is found in Besse (I., 137): "On 
the 2lst of the Month called August [1659] Ralph Sharpley" and 
others, " going toward the Meeting at Ashburn, were, by Order of two 
Justices, set in the Stocks above an Hour. After they were released thence, 
Ralph Sharpley was concerned to preach to the People, for which he was 
sent to the House of Correction," for two days, and finally committed to 
"Derby Goal, where he was kept ten Days." In 1661 for attending a 
meeting at Eyam in the High-Peak he was imprisoned and subjected to 
cruel treatment [Besse, I., 138-139).

They held meetings for worship at the houses of 
Valentine Hollingsworth and Cornelius Empson.^ 
Valentine Hollingsworth lived on a largeplantation 
of nearly a thousand acres on Shelpot Creek, in 
Brandywine Hundred, about five miles north-east 
of the present City of Wilmington, Delaware, and 
in 1 687, he gave " unto ffriends for A burying place 
half an Acre of [his] land for y' purpose there be- 
ing Some already buried in y^ Spot, ffriends have 
referred fencing of it." ^ A meeting-house was 
afterward built on this plot and the meeting known 
as Newark, from the name of the plantation, 
which in the original survey of 1684 was called 
'' New Worke," doubtless a corruption of Newark. 
A meeting was continued here until 1754, when 
the Friends "being suited with a better conveni- 
ency, it was laid down." '^ 
NewCasiu \^ i gg^^ "John Hussey, John Richardson, Ed- 
ward Blake, Benjamin Swett and other Friends,

ground was purchased, and a meeting-house 
built."" Very few Irish Friends settled here.

New Castle County, as early as 1730, but was 
not regularly established until 1737. The meet- 
ing received its name of Hockessin from an In- 
dian village formerly near the place. Among the 
first settlers were John Baldwin, William Cox, 
and the Irish Friends, Henry and John Dixon. 
In 1738, a meeting-house was built, and enlarged 
in 1745.-

founders of the town, until later in the year a 
small brick meeting-house — now a part of Friends' 
School at Fourth and West Streets — was erected. 
In 1748 a larger house was built. This in turn 
was succeeded by the present structure, erected in 
I Si 6. The monthly meeting was formed in 1750 
by a division of Newark Monthly Meeting.^ Quite

1795, the wooden structure erected at this time 
was replaced by the present brick building.- One 
of the most prominent of the early ministers of 
this meeting was Christopher Wilson, who came 
over from Ireland in 1712, and settled in New 
Castle County.

migration began to move into the backwoods, and

uplands of Chester County. For a time these

Quaker pioneers made the long and often danger- 
ous journey to attend the meetings of the old 
settlements, but as other members settled near 
them, meetings of their own were erected, held 
at first in private houses, later in rude log meet- 
ing-houses, and ultimately, keeping pace with the 
development of the country, in more substantial 
buildinos of brick or stone.

Four monthly meetings, Newark, New Garden, 
Bradford, and Goshen, were held within the present 
limits of Chester County previous to 1750. New- 
ark Monthly Meeting, the parent of New Garden 
and Bradford, was established in New Castle 
County, in 1686, and included not only the meet- 
ings of New Castle County, but all those of southern 
Chester County, until the erection of the Monthly 
Meetings of New Garden in 171S, and Bradford 
in 1737. Goshen Monthly Meeting, formed from 
Chester Monthly Meeting in 1722, included within 
its bounds nearly all the northern meetings of the 
County. 

Newark Monthly Meeting, since 1760 known Newark or 
as Kennett Monthly Meeting, held its first ses- Mont^Meet- 
sions, according to the minutes, in 1686, at the i^g 
house of the widow Welsh in New Castle, and 
continued there until 6 Mo. 28, 1687, when it was 
decided "y' it may be more Convenient] for y'= 
present, that it be kept twice over y^ other Side

castle."^ The Monthly Meeting was held mostly 
at Valentine Hollingsworth's after 1689, but cir- 
culated to various houses up to 3 Mo. 6, 1 704, 
when " This meeting Orders that our next 
Monthly Meeting be held at y' Center w'*" is sup- 
posed to be George Harlans ould house." It 
was held last at Newark in 1707, but after Center 
Meeting House was built it was usually held at 
the latter place for some years. At length it be- 
came settled at Kennett, and on that account 
dropped the old name of Newark - 
Kenneii Samucl Smith, in his history of the Pennsylvania 
Meeting rneetings,'^ says that in 1707, "Vincent Caldwell, 
Thomas Wickersham, Joel Daily, Thomas Hope, 
Guyan Miller [an Irish Friend], and others, being 
settled in Kennet and the east end of Marl- 
borough, had liberty to keep a meeting for wor- 
ship sometimes in private houses. In the year 
1 7 10 a piece of land was purchased and a meet- 
ing-house built, which was enlarged in 17 19; in 

1 73 1 it was further enlarged." One of the most 
eminent ministers of this meeting was Thomas 
Carleton, a native of King's County, Ireland.

In 1699, William Penn directed Henry Holling-s- Manor of 
worth, deputy-surveyor of Chester County, to lay Letiua-s" 
out a tract of 30,000 acres of land for his two "^^1^°^ 
children, William and Letitia Penn. This survey 
included all of the present Township of New 
Garden and the oreater part of Kennett, with 
several thousand acres in the northern part of 
New Castle County. 

The large survey was divided, the eastern part, 
consisting of 15,500 acres, being conveyed to 
Letitia Penn, and the western part, of 14,500 acres, 
to her brother William Penn, Jr. Letitia's tract 
was confirmed to her by her father's patent, dated 
October 23, 1701, in consideration of one " Bever 
skinn" yearly and "the fatherly love and natural 
affection I bear to her my said daughter." This 
tract received the name of the Manor of Steyning, 
also called Letitia's Manor, with the privilege "To 
have and to hold a Court Baron with all things 
whatsoever to a Court Baron belonging, and to 
have and to hold view of ffranck pledge for the 
conservation of the peace and the better Govern- 
ment of y^ tenants holding or hereafter to hold of 
the said Mannor." 

Letitia Penn, who had come over to Pennsyl- 
vania with her father on his second visit in 1699, 
returned with him to England in 1701, before her 
departure by power of attorney authorizing James 
Logan and Edward Pennington to dispose of land 



128 Immi<rratio7i of the Irish Oitakers 

and to have the management of her property here. 
Pennington soon died and Logan was her sole at- 
torney, until in 171 1, having married William 
Aubrey, a London merchant, Letitia and her hus- 
band executed another power of attorney to 
Logan and Samuel Carpenter. 
Kennett The land described in Letitia Penn's patent in- 
Township (,l^JgJ nearly all of the Township of Kennett, 
excepting a few small tracts already conveyed to 
settlers, and although for some years known by 
its manorial name, it soon came to be called Ken- 
nett.^ Kennett is first mentioned on the court 
records in February, 1705, when Henry Peirce 
appeared in court as constable for that township. 
In 1706, he was appointed supervisor of the high- 
ways, and Ezekiel Harlan (son of George Har- 
lan), the heaviest tax payer in the Township, suc- 
ceeded him as constable. George Harlan and 
Gayen Miller were probably the first of the Irish

Friends to secure land in Kennett. In 1702, 
Miller purchased 200 acres on the east branch of 
Red Clay Creek, including the eastern part of the 

' The name Kennett, it is Ihoiiglit, was suggested by Krancis Smith, who 
in 16S6 had taken up 200 acres of land at the mouth of Pocopson Creek, 
within the original limits of the township, and who had come from Devizes, 
in Wiltshire, England, in which county there is a creek and a village 
called Kennett.

present Borough of Kennett Square.' He was 
elected to the Provincial Assembly in 1 714." Har- 
lan, as we have previously stated, settled at first 
at Centre in New Castle County, but soon moved 
up the Brandywine and purchased 470 acres in 
Kennett, now Pennsbury, Township. While liv- 
ing here he had for his neighbors, over the creek 
in a great bend, a settlement of Indians. After 
they had gone away he obtained, in 1701, a war- 
rant for 200 acres in this bend of the creek, the 
land beino- aranted " in reirard of the great trouble 
and charge he has bore in fencing and maintain- 
incr the same for the said Indians while living 
thereon." George Harlan was elected to the Pro- 
vincial Assembly from New Castle County in 
1695, and from Chester County in 1712.^ 

Of the forty-three persons taxed in Kennett, 
in 171 5, there were nine Irish Friends, as follows : 
Gayen Miller, 8s. 6d. ; Michael Harlan, 5s. 6d. ; 
Ezekiel Harlan, 12s. 6d. ; Aaron Harlan, 5s. 6d. ; 
Moses Harlan, 4s. 2d. ; Valentine HoUingsworth, 
2s. 9d. ; James Harlan, 2s. 6d. ; Joshua Harlan, 

' Kennett Square was laid out and named about 1768 or 1769 ; for in 
a deed of 9 Mo. 29, 1768, William Dixson conveyed to Joseph Musgrave 
a tract of 3 acres in Kennett Township, " in a place intended to be laid 

out for an inland town called town," the blank indicating that a name 

had not yet been chosen ; and the next year Dixson conveyed to Musgrave 
another tract "near a place called Kennett Square." Both grantor and 
grantee in this transaction were of Irish Quaker stock.

the western part ot the 30,000 acres surveyed 
by HoUingsworth, in 1699, and his sister Letitia 
the eastern part. The western tract of 14,500 
acres was granted by patent to Penn, by the com- 
missioners of property. May 24, 1 706, and like his 
sister's land received the name of the Manor of 
Steyning. Before obtaining the patent young 
Penn had already appointed Griffith Owen, James 
Logan, and Robert Ashton as his attorneys, he 
being about to return to England. The land was 
not immediately taken up by settlers, but about 
1 7 1 1 , several families of Friends from Ireland, 
principally from the Province of Leinster, with a 
few from the Province of Ulster, arrived and, pre- 
senting their certificates of removal to Newark 
Monthly Meeting, settled in that part of the Manor 
which lay north of the circular line, giving to their 
new home the name of New Garden in remem- 
brance of New Garden Meeting, in County Car- 
low, Ireland, whence came John Lowden and 
others of the company. Some time after, the part 
of the Manor north of the circular line was erected 
into a township and called New Garden. 

These Irish Friends in most cases had been 
settled on the land some years before obtaining 



Places of Settlement 131 

their titles. In 171 2, Gayen Miller, of Kennett, 
purchased 700 acres, while the next year grants 
were made to John Lowden, James Lindley, 
Michael Lightfoot, Joseph Hutton, from County 
Carlow ; James Starr, from County Meath ; Wil- 
liam Halliday, from County West Meath ; Thomas 
Jackson, from Queen's County; and John Miller, 
from Grange near Charlemont ; and in 17 14, to 
Thomas Garnett, from Grange near Charlemont, 
and to Joseph Sharp, possibly from Dublin or near 
by. The whole amount of land purchased by 
these Friends, including two grants to Mary Row- 
land, in 1708, and to Abram Marshall in 1713, 
Friends not from Ireland, was 5413 acres, at the 
rate of £ 20 per hundred, or according to modern 
computation, one dollar per acre. 

A drafts of the Manor, made not lonof after the 
above grants, probably by John Taylor, surveyor, is 
reproduced on the next page in the form of a map, 
and shows that nearly the whole of what is now New 
Garden Township was seated by Irish Friends.'- 
The following is a list of the first settlers of the 
Manor, as shown on this map, the numbers indi- 
cating the location of the land and the asterisk 
showing who were Irish Friends : 

1 The original draft is in possession of Thompson Richards, of Tough- 
kenamon, who is a descendant of several families of Irish Friends, and who 
owns and resides upon a large part of the 700 acres granted to his ances- 
tor, Mary Rowland, iri 170S.

The tracts, as may be seen, were mostly rec- 
taneular. In the north-east corner we find Rob- 
ert Johnson, from County Carlow, with 200 
acres, confirmed to him in 171 5 ; Evan Evans, 
probably a Welshman, with 500 acres in the 
north-west corner, which he sold some time prior 
to 1 716 to Thomas Garnett; Joseph Sharp 
below him on White Clay Creek, 200 acres, 

tory of the land, as laid out in this draft, from the first to the present 
owners, which appeared in the weekly issues of the Kennett Square

is a prominent member of New Garden Monthly Meeting and a son of the 
late Dr. Ezra Michener, author of A Retrospect of Qiiaierism, so frequently 
cited in this work, is the custodian of a large collection of Friends' rec- 
ords kept in a safe at his residence in New G.irden, and as a surveyor and 
conveyancer for many years in the Township, he has had exceptional op- 
portunities for the compilation of these sketches. What makes the sketches 
of special value is the fact that he has made use of the original title deeds, 
many of which have not been recorded.

granted in 1717 ; James Lindley, 200 acres, lying 
north of the Toughkenamon^ Hill. The remain- 
ing land north of the hill, about 1,050 acres, was 
vacant. From the hill a line ran south through 
the middle of the Manor, following the course of 
the present road from Toughkenamon to New 
Garden Meeting House, almost to the circular 
line. Taking the east side we have first, Mary 
Rowland, 700 acres, including the beautiful valley 
which extends from the present village of Tough- 
kenamon to Kennett Square. Ne.xt south of this 
tract 800 acres were divided among John Sharp, 
doubdess a brother of Joseph Sharp, on the east 
side 300 acres ; Joseph Sharp, 200 acres, confirmed 
to him in 17 14, but sold by him the next year ; 
and Thomas Garnett, with 300 acres. South of 
these on the Kennett line were William Tanner, 
probably an Irish Friend, with 200 acres, which 
passed finally into the hands of Thomas Milhous, 

an arrival from Dublin, in 1729; John Lowden, 
from County Carlow, with 300 acres ; and Benja- 
min Fred, with 300 acres, the latter almost touch- 
ing on the circular line. Below Benjamin Fred 
came Simon Hadly, from County West Meath,

tween these and the middle line were Michael 
Lightfoot, (300 acres), who arrived in 171 2, be- 
came an eminent minister of the Society, and some 
years later removed to Philadelphia, at the time 
of his death being Treasurer of the Province ; John 
Wily, from County West Meath, with 200 acres ; 
Thomas Jackson, with 200 acres ; and continuing 
southward, William Halliday, with 200 acres. 
John Miller owned 1,013 acres which extended 
from the middle line to London Grove Township 
on the west, and from Toughkenamon Hill to 
New Garden Meeting House. He lived on White 
Clay Creek, on or near the site of Avondale, 
and built a trrist mill — the first in that region 
— which did the o-finding for the inhabitants 
many miles around, even, it is said, as far as 
Lancaster. New Garden Meeting was held at 
his house as early as 1712. He also owned a 
smaller tract of land. No. 15, the greater part of 
which extended into New Castle County. He was 
appointed a representative to the Provincial As-

south of Miller's large tract, Joseph Hutton held 
250 acres on the west line, and James Starr 
350 acres on the middle line. Of 900 acres south 
of these, Francis Hobson, from Grange near 
Charlemont, held 200 acres in the north-east corner 
and the remainder was purchased by Gayen 
Miller. From this southward there was a vacant 
tract of several thousand acres. 

Of the twenty-two persons taxed in New Gar-

further of settleing a meeting at or nere John Mil- 
ler's, Do allow that a first and fifth Dayes meeting 
be kept at John Miller's Dwelling House for this 
Ensuing Quarter, or until further order, and the

A meeting-house was built probably later in 
this year, on a rectangular tract of six acres, in 
the south-east corner of John Miller's original 
plantation. James Miller, of New Garden, yeo- 
man, son and heir of John Miller, for a considera-

It was held sometimes at Nottingham, now in 
Cecil County, Marjdand, until the establishment 
of Nottingham Monthly meeting, in 1730: and 
afterward alternated to London Grove, until the 
erection of London Grove Monthly Meeting, in 
1792. The first clerk of the Monthly Meeting 
was James Starr, who served until 1726, when he 
was succeeded by Benjamin Fred.^ 

Adjoining New Garden on the west is London London Grove 
Grove Township to which also came many Irish °^°^ '^ 
Friends. This township was organized in 1723. 
On August 12, 1699, William Penn sold to Tobias 
Collet, Daniel Ouare, Henry Goldney, and Michael 
Russell, Friends of London, among other lands, 
60,000 acres, not then located, and granted a 
warrant, dated 6 Mo. (August) 17, 1699, for the 
survey thereof These persons admitted others 
into partnership with them, and formed a com- 
pany, generally known as the London Company, London

of shares eventually reaching 8,800, and the share-

1 40 luimigration of tlic Irish Quakers 

acres, a survey in Chester County, was made of 
16,500 acres, which inchided nearly all of the 
present Township of London Grove and the 
greater part of the Townships of Franklin (for- 
merly a part of New London) and London Britain. 
This tract was rectangular, being over three miles 
wide, and about eight and six-tenths miles long. 
That part of London Grove which lies directly 
north of New Garden, containing 718 acres, was 
subsequently added to the former survey, so that 
the London Company owned, altogether, 17,218 
acres in Chester County, for which a patent was 
granted June 25, 1718. Much of the land was 
originally leased for a term of years, with stipula- 
tions that a certain number of acres should be 
cleared and plowed yearly, orchards planted, etc. 
The following advertisement was probably cir- 
culated soon after the land was taken up : 

"The PkurRimoRs Oi" Tiik Pe.\silvani.\ Land

"To all persons that are willing to settle upon 
lands in Pensilvania, and the territories there- 
unto belonging, 

"That they will Give to Every such Person or 
Persons I-'ifty Acres of Land to them and their 
Heirs for ever, Free and Clear of all manner of

and cleared Ten Acres of Land, every Family so 
settling shall have Deeds executed by the trustees, 
and sent them over upon Certificate for that 
purpose first obtained under the Hands of this 
Company's Agent or Agents Residing in Pensil- 
vania. 

" Samuel Carpenter & Tho. ffairtnan are the 
Comp's Agents." 

Under the direction of the Company's agent, 
John Estaugh, of Haddonfield, in New Jersey, 
Isaac Taylor, Deputy-Surveyor of Chester County, 
surveyed many tracts for settlers on the Company's 
lands. Like those of New Garden the subdivis- 
ions in London Grove were mostly rectangular, 
and a laree number of them seem to have been 
laid out in 1718 and 1719. Many of the settlers 
obtained deeds for their lands, dated March 14, 
1722-3, from Collet, Ouare, and Goldney. 

John Cane, a Friend, who with his wife Ann 
came over from County Armagh about 1713, was 
one of the first settlers of London Grove, but he 
did not long sur- 

Vive to enjoy his ^^ Qyi^hn^ 
new home. John /y 
Allen, who was an 
Irish Friend, arrived as early as 17 14 and lo- 



142 Imyttigration of tlie Irish Quakers 

cated in the Township on the north-west line of 
New Garden. Here he built and operated one 
of the earliest mills of that section. In 1719 
he purchased from Thomas Garnett an adjoining 
tract of 200 acres over the line in New Garden, 
being part of the 500 acres granted to Garnett by 
Evan Evans, as previously stated. Below Allen 
we find Joseph Sharp with a tract of 100 acres, 
which joined his plantation in New Garden. 
Joseph Sharp, a tanner by trade, was appointed 
one of the overseers of the poor in the newly- 
organized Township of London Grove in 1723. 
His son, Samuel Sharp, a resident in London 
Grove, served as a member of the Continental 
Congress. In 1722, James Lindley, of New Gar- 
den, purchased 400 acres and in the next year 
became the first constable of the Township. 
Jeremiah Starr, of Oldcastle, County Meath, 
brother of James Starr, of New Garden, arrived 
with his family in the year 171 7, and took up a 
tract of land in London Grove, a little north-west 
of Avondale. He represented Chester County in 
the Assembly from 1 738 until 1 743, when he be- 
came Collector of Excise, a position he held until 

Of the forty-two taxable persons in London 
Grove in 1724 there were ten Irish Friends : John 
Allen, 8s.; Joseph Sharp, 13s.; Jeremiah Starr, 4s.

London Grove Meeting was established by au- London Grove 
thority of Chester Quarterly Meeting in 1 714, and '^^ '"^ 
was held at the house of John Smith, son-in-law of 
Caleb Pusey, in what is now East Marlborough, 
until 1724, when a meeting-house was erected in 
the north-east corner of London Grove. In 1743 
this was replaced by a larger house. An addition 
was made to this building in 1775, for Richard 
Barnard, a member of the meeting, notes in his 
diary under date of 10 Mo. 19, 1775, that he was 
" At London Grove, raisinsj adition to meeting 
house."' This structure was removed in 1818, 
and the present meeting-house built.'- 

North of Kennett, New Garden, and London Marlborough 
Grove was Marlborough Township, named from ^"^^^""p 
Marlborough, in Wiltshire, England, and organized 
in 1 704. The eastern part was laid out about 
1700, in right of purchases made in England, as 
was also some of the western part. The Town- 
ship was divided into East and West Marlborough 
in 1729.

1 44 J)iiniigratio)i of tJie Irish Quakers 

The only resident Irish Friend mendoned in 
dic! list of twenty-eight persons taxed in the 
Joseph Township in 171 5, was Joseph Pennock, a nadve 

Pennock ^j- (^loprnel, County Tipperary. He removed to 
what is now West Marlborough Township as early 
as 1 7 14 and settled on a large tract of 1250 acres, 
of which he became proprietor by virtue of a 
grant from William I'enn to his grandfather, 
George Collett, of Clonmel. In i 738 he built a 
mansion called " Primitive Hall," which is still 
standing in a good state of preservation. Pen- 
nock took a prominent and active part in meet- 
ing and civil affairs, serving as a member of the 
Provincial Assembly almost continuously from 
1 7 16 to 1744.^ For many years he was a jus- 
tice of the peace,- and in 1736, during the Cre- 
sap War, rising from the dispute over the 
boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland, 
he was one of the five men appointed by Gover- 
nor Thomas Penn to investigate a conspiracy 
hatched by agents of Maryland among the set- 
tlers of New Garden and London Grove. 

By the Minutes of the Board of Property, i Mo. 
6, 1724-5, we find that " Joseph Pennock requests 

the Grant of acres of the tract called S'r John 

t'^^.gg's [Fagg's Manor], if to be disposed of " ^

Manor which later was erected into Londonderry 
Township and which adjoined London Grove on 
the west. At this period the Manor was exposed 
to the encroachments of the Scotch-Irish squatters, 
who caused the authorities much annoyance by 
the irregularities of their settlements. John Tay- 
lor, the surveyor, notes in his memorandum-book 
that on April 3rd, 1730 he " went and warned the 
Irish off Fagg's Manor." In the following letter 
to James Steel, manager of the land-office, in 
Philadelphia, Pennock evidently is writing of the 
tract requested of the Board of Property, and, not 
having a patent, doubtless has been having trouble 
to hold his land against the squatters. The letter^ 
is given with the quaintness and phonetic speUing 
of the orieinal.

Joseph Pennock's son Nathaniel Pennock also 
served many years in the Assembly, until in the 
memorable year of 1 756, with the beginning of the 
war against the Indians, he and other Friends 
resigned their seats declaring that they could not 
be a part of a government openly at war. 

In the movine and drifting about which was 
continually occurring among the settlers, other 
Irish Friends made their way to the Marl- 
boroughs, among the earliest of whom were 
Ezekiel and William Harlan of the numerous pro- 
geny of the I larlans, Thomas Jackson, who came 




'^ • cTl^hfi^ 



Places of Settleme7it 1 47 

over from New Garden Township as early as 
1 7 18, and Samuel Beverly, from Ballinacree Meet- 
ing, County Antrim. 

Crossing the northern boundary of Marlbor- Newun xowr- 
ough we come to a township the whole of which by an wsh 
was owned by an Irish Friend, Nathaniel Newlin, of Q"^''" 
Concord, and named 
in his honor Newlin 
Township. This 
tract, consisting of seven thousand seven hundred 
acres, through the center of which flows Brandy- 
wine Creek, was purchased by Newlin, evidently as 
a land speculation, from the trustees of the Free 
Society of Traders, by deed of June 10, 1724, for 
a consideration of ;^8oo, and at once negotiations 
were entered into for the sale of portions of it. 

Soon a difficulty arose with the Indians, who NewiMs 
had a village on the north side of the Brandywine JfiJ"l/in. 
in the east end of the tract, and laid claim to the '^""^ 
land one mile wide on each side of the Creek ; 
but Newlin and the purchasers from him paid no 
attention to their demands. Thereupon, in the 
summer of 1725, several of the tribe led by the 
chief Checochinican proceeded to Philadelphia 
and appeared before the Provincial Assembly, 
through their interpreters, one of whom was Eze- 
kiel Harlan, making complaint of the encroach- 
ments upon their lands. The Assembly carefully 
considered the case, but made no satisfactory ad- 
justment before adjourning. 



148 hnmigration of the Irish Quakers 

At the beeinnintj of the next session in the fol- 
lowing year, the Indians again appeared and 
urged their claims. The subject was again taken 
up and James Logan on behalf of the Commis- 
sioners of Property reported that they had " used 
such means as they thought most likely to satisfy" 
the Indians, "and continues them in the quiet 
possession of their claims, and for that end . . . 
had agreed and accommodated the matter with 
Nathaniel Newlin." Newlin was then summoned 
before the Assembly, and declared in writing that 
" neither he nor his heirs will, by any means, dis- 
turb or molest the Indians in their possessions or 
claims." With these assurances the Indians ex- 
pressed themselves as satisfied, and after shaking 
hands with Newlin in a friendly manner, quietly 
returned to their homes. 

The work of settlement, however, seems not to 
have been retarded, and in 1729 the chief Checo- 
chinican, on behalf of his people, appealed once 
more to the government, writing that notwith- 
standing Newlin's promise that they should not 
be disturbed in the free and peaceable enjoyment 
of their lands on the Brandywine, some of their 
lands had been sold, and they had been forbidden 
even to make use of timber growing thereon for 
the building of cabins. What action, if any, was 
taken upon this complaint has not been learned, 
but not long after, the greater part of the Indians

removed from the County, and all trouble grow- 
ing out of their claims ceased.

to pay a yearly quit rent of one shilling per

On the death of Nathaniel Newlin in 1729, 
those portions of the Township yet unsold were 
divided among his children as follows: John, 946 
acres; Nathaniel, 1,620 acres; Jemima, wife of 
Richard Eavenson, 913 acres; Kesia, wife of

Newlin was not the only township in Chester 
County owned by an Irish Friend. By patent 
dated December 3, 1705, William Penn granted 
to Joseph Pike,' a wealthy Quaker merchant, of 

'Joseph Pike, the author of several works relating to 1-riends (see 
Joseph .Smith's Calalogiif of Friends' Boots, II., 414), son of Richard 
and Elizabeth Pike, was bom II Mo. 15, 1657, on a farm called Kil-

about 1627, in the town of Newberry, Berkshire, England, of parents of 
good reputation "and having some estate in houses there " ; and about

Cork, a tract of over 10,000 acres of land, lying 
north of the Great Valley, which was organized 
under the name of Pikeland Township, and in 
1838 divided into East and West Pikeland. 
Joseph Pike died in 1729, and by his will, dated 
1727, and proved in the Prerogative Court of the 
Archbishop of Armagh, devised Pikeland and a 
tract of over 1,500 acres in Cain, on the south- 
ern part of which is now Cain Meeting House, 

1648, he " came over to Ireland a Corporal in a Troop of Horse in Crom- 
well's Array." He married Elizabeth Jackson, bom in London about 
1636, of parents of good repute, " some of her connexions having been 
chief magistrates of that city," and settled near Cork. Richard and 
Elizabeth Pike were among the Friends convinced by the ministry of Ed- 
ward Burrough at Cork in 1655. In 1664, they removed from the farm of 
Kilcreagh to Cork and kept a shop. Richard died 4 Mo. 1668, while a 
prisoner for his Quaker principles, and was the first Friend interred in the 
burial ground of the Society outside the south gate of Cork. Elizabeth 
died in 1688. Their children were : Elizabeth, married Henry Wheddon, 
merchant, and died in 1693; Joseph; Ebenezer ; Richard; Sarah; and 
Benjamin, who died the same day as his father. 

Joseph Pike was married in 1682, to Elizabeth Rogers, eldest daughter 
of Francis Rogers, a minister of the Society. After his marriage he joined 
his brother Richard in opening a linen-draper's shop in Cork, the first of 
the kind in the city. His business affairs fi-equently took him to England, 
Holland, and Flanders. On one of these journeys he accompanied William 
Penn to Holland and attended the yearly meeting at Amsterdam. Thomas 
Story notes in his journal (p. 533) that in 1716, while on a religious journey 
to Ireland, he visited Joseph Pike, of Cork, among whose guests one day 
at dinner were the young Countess of Kildare, her maiden sister, and three 
others of the gentry. Joseph and Elizabeth Pike had fourteen children, 
of whom seven survived : Richard ; Mary, married Thomas Beale, son of 
Joshua, of Mountmellick ; Elizabeth, married to Joshua Beale, brother of 
Thomas ; Rachel ; Samuel ; Benjamin ; and Anne. — .\utobiography of

to his wife Elizabetli. The widow Pitce lield the 
lands until her death in 1733, when they came 
into possession of her son, Richard Pike. I le 
died about 1752, and by his will' bequeathed all 
his estate in Pennsylvania to his kinsmen, Sam- 
uel Hoare and Nathaniel Newberr)', merchants of 
London. In 1756, Hoare purchased Newberry's 
interest and became the sole owner. The land 
was then offered for sale in small tracts. Amone 
the first settlers were Samuel Lightfoot (son of 
Thomas), a surveyor, and builder of the first mill 
in that neighborhood ; Michael Lightfoot ; Thomas

Kirks of Lurgan, County Armagh.

erected the same year on John Mendenhall's land. 
In 1726, it was decided to build another meeting- 
house " upon the further side of y" mounten." 
Some years later Richard Pike, a Friend, of Cork, 
who owned over 1,500 acres in Cain Township, 
conveyed to Thomas Parke and Robert Miller, of 
East Cain, for the use of Friends, a lot.'of ground 
on which a meeting-house had been built with his 
consent ; whether this was the second or a third 
location has not been determined. In 1801 the 
meeting-house was enlarged to accommodate the 
new Quarterly Meeting of Cain. 

Cain Township, originally including the territory East Cain 
now embraced in Cain, East Cain, West Cain, """"" 
East Brandywine, West Brandywine, and a part of 
Valley Township, and the Borough of Downing- 
town, and that part of Coatesville lying east of 
the west branch of Brandywine Creek, was named 
from the town of Calne, in Wiltshire, England, 
and was organized as a township about 17 14. 
In 1728 it was divided into the Townships of East 
and West Cain. 

In East Cain settled WiUiam Pim, from Queen's 
County, for many years clerk of Bradford Monthly 
Meeting, overseer and elder of Cain Meeting, and 
justice of the peace ; his sons Thomas and Rich- 
ard Pim ; Thomas Parke, from County Carlow, an 
elder of Cain Meeting, purchaser of 500 acres of 
land at the site of Downingtown or near by, where

some of his descendants of the name yet reside ; 
Robert Valentine (son of Thomas Valentine and 
grandson of Thomas Parke), from County Car- 
low, an eminent minister of the Society of P'riends, 
who made a religious visit to Great Britain at the 
close of the Revolution ; Thomas Coates, son of 
Moses Coates, from County Carlow ; Thomas 
Pain, from Queen's County ; Joseph Wilkinson, 
son of Francis Wilkinson, from Ballinacree, 
County Antrim ; and Evan Wilkinson, probably 
the latter's brother, from Ballinacree, a settler in 
West Cain. 

Moses Coates, grandson of Moses Coates, the 
emigrant from County Carlow, was married in 
1770 to Hannah Musgrave, daughter of Thomas 
Musgrave, an Irish Quaker, of Sadsbury, Lan- 
caster County, and became the owner of a tract 
of land now occupied by the Borough of Coates- 
ville, which was laid out and named in his honor 
by his son Dr. Jesse Coates. 

In 1 731, Moses Coates, a Friend, originally from 
County Carlow, purchased 600 acres, and James 
Starr, one of the first settlers of New Garden, 350 
acres, in Charlestown, now Schuylkill, Township, 
on the north side of French Creek at its junction 
with Schuylkill River, and became the first settlers 
at the site of Phoenixville. Judge Pennypacker, 
who has written an interesting history of the be- 
ginnings of this town, relates that previous to his 



Places of Settlement 155 

purchase Moses Coates "had lived for about a 
year upon the other side of the Schuylkill, where 
stands the present village of Mont Clare, a locality 
he selected because the Indians were there less 
numerous. At night he slept with a loaded gun 
at his side, and a servant lay at the door of his 
hut with a pitch fork. Upon longer acquaintance, 
however, he found the Indians disposed to be 
friendly, and his fear of their hostility being dis- 
sipated he changed his place of residence"^ to 
the other side of the River. Here he "blazed 
paths through the wilderness about his home, by 
cutting chips from the sides of the trees, so that 
his children should not be lost." ^ 

In 1732, James Starr erected a mill which was EastNantmeai 
placed under control of his two sons, James and ^""^^•"p 
Moses ; and this was the first use of the water 
power of French Creek. ^ A near neighbor of the 
Starrs and Coates was Thomas Valentine, orig- 
inally from Ballybrumhill, County Carlow, who 
settled across the Schuylkill in New Providence 
Township, now Montgomery County. 

In the summer of i 736, Joshua Marsh and his 
son John Marsh, with their families, from Grange 
near Charlemont, arrived and settled among the 
Welsh in East Nantmeal Township. Two years 
later they were joined by Joshua's son-in-law,

Thomas McMillan, and family from Ballinacree, 
County Antrim. The only other Irish Friends 
known to be in the locality were their nearest 
neii^hbors, William and Timothy Kirk, sons of 
Alphonsus Kirk, of New Castle County, William 
Kirk for many years serving as overseer of Nant- 
meal Meeting. 

These Friends brought their certificates to 
Goshen Monthly Meeting, thereby becoming 
members thereof and attended Uwchlan Partic- 
ular and Preparative meetings until the establish- 
ment of Nantmeal Particular Meeting and the 
erection of a meeting house there in 1741, when 
Nantmeal became their place of worship, al- 
though they still attended preparative meetings 
at Uwchlan. 

A meeting-house was built at Nantmeal in 
1777. This was burned about 1795, and another 
house was built. For many years the meet- 
ing has been extinct. Uwchlan Particular Meet- 
ing was established in 1 7 1 2, and the Preparative 
Meeting two years later. The present meeting- 
house was built in 1756. 

About 1750, the Marshes and McMillans joined 
the early westward movement and migrated to 
Warrington Township, York County, becoming 
members of Warrington Meeting. 
Nottingham Among the Irish Friends who made their way 
to the Nottingham settlements, now in Maryland,

were : Roger Kirk, son of Alphonsus Kirk, of

The Friends of Nottingham were residents of 
Chester County, until about i 765, when the run- 
ninaf of the famous Mason and Dixon line broutjht 
them within the limits of Cecil County, Maryland. 
In 1 701, a company of friends, prominent among 
whom were John Churchman, Andrew Job, Wil- 
liam and James Brown, and Henry Reynolds, re- 
moved from the old settlements in the vicinity of 
Chester and settled on a tract of some 18,000 
acres of land called Nottingham on Octorara 
Creek. 

In 1 705, they had a meeting settled among them, 
held at the home of William Brown, until the erec- 
tion of a meeting-house in 1708-9. This build- 
ing was replaced by one of brick in 1724. John 
Churchman notes in his journal that in 1748 the 
latter was destroyed by fire, and until a new meet- 
iniT-house could be built the meetings were held 
in a private house. When rebuilt, a stone addi- 
tion was made to the original brick-work. The 
wood-work was again destroyed by fire in 18 10. 
In 181 1 the present structure was erected, and 
although one-half stone, has always been known 
as the "Brick Meeting." 

Nottingham Meeting constituted a part of Con- 
cord Monthly Meeting until in 171 5 it was trans- 
ferred to Newark Monthly Meeting. On the 
erection of New Garden in 17 18 it became a part 
of that Monthly Meeting, thus continuing until 



Places of Settlement 1 59 

1730, when Nottingham Monthly Meeting, con- 
sisting of the meetings of East Nottingham, West 
Nottingham, and Rush River, was established. 

The first of the Irish Friends to settle in what Lancaster 

County 

is now Lancaster County were John Musgrave 
and his son, Moses Musgrave, who as early as 
1 713 had taken up land in the almost uninhabited 
region on Octoraro Creek within the present liinits 
of Sadsbury Meeting, the father purchasing 600 
acres and the son 3CX) acres.' John Musgrave, as 
we have stated before, came over from the north 
of Ireland in 1682, as an indented servant to 
Valentine HoUingsworth, and served his time with 
his master in New Castle County.- He was an 
active participant in the local affairs of his neigh- 
borhood, and in 1730 and 1731 represented Lan- 
caster County in the Provincial Assembly.^ 

For a decade the Musgraves were probably the 
only Irish Friends in Sadsbury, or indeed in all the 
County, there being no others mentioned in the 
tax lists of 1 718 for either Sadsbury or Cones- 
toga;^ but about 1723 an advance-guard of a 
larger migration, conspicuous among whom were 
Andrew Moore and Samuel Jackson, from Ballin- 
acree. County Antrim, arrived and located near

the Gap at the end of the Great Chester Valley. 
Soon these pioneers were joined by other mem- 
bers of the Society, many of them remaining in 
Sadsbury, and others, under the leadership of 
Hattill Varman, from County Wexford, pushing 
farther to the westward and forming a settlement 
in Leacock. Such a large proportion of these 
Friends were from Ireland that the meedngs, which 
were soon established, were frequently known as 
the Irish meetings. Edmund Peckover, a Friend 
of the ministr)-. from England, who visited these 
"back-settlers" in 1742, speaks of them as 
"Friends from Ireland" who have "three or four 
meetings ; though Friends are but thin to what 
they are in other parts of the province."^ 

In addition to those just mentioned, the follow- 
ing were some of the immigrants to this region : 
Thomas McClun or McClung, from County West 
Meath ; William McNabb, from Oldcasde, County 
Meath ; Neal O' Moony, John Boyd and sons Wil- 
liam and Samuel, James Hunter, Samuel Wilkin- 
son, and William Courtney, from Hallinacree, 
County Antrim ; William Evans, from County 
Wicklow ; John Griffith and son Christopher, from 
Grange near Charlemont ; Jonas Chamberlin, from 
King's County ; James Love and Thomas Nevitt, 
from County Cavan ; Isaac Steer and sons John

from County Armagh ; Thomas Bulla and Law- 
rence Richardson, from Grange, probably near 
Charlemont ; and Thomas Lindley (son of James 
Lindly), a representative to the Provincial As- 
sembly. 

Meetings of an informal character were held in Sadsbury 
Sadsbur)' in 1723,^ but a regular meeting was not " ^^'"^ 
established until the following year, when "Samuel 
Miller and Andrew ]\Ioore made application, on 
behalf of themselves and their friends settled about 
Sadsbur)', for liberty to build a meeting, which 
being granted by the Quarterly Meeting, they 
built one in 1725, which goes by the name of 
Sadsbury Meeting."^ The stone-work of the 
present meeting-house was built about 1760, but 
the wood-work was burned during the period of 
the Revolution.^ 

In 1729, "Sadsbury' Preparative Meeting re- Leacock 
quested on behalf of Friends who live beyond -^^^^'^"s 
Pequea, to have a meeting at the house of Hat- 
tell Varman [in Leacock Township] every sixth- 
da}' of the week ; which this meeting allows."* 
The regular First-day meeting at Leacock was 
estabHshed in 1732 and held at Varman's house. 
In 1 749, the meeting was removed to Lampeter

Township and the name of the meeting changed 
to Lampeter, 
sadsbury In I ']■},'], the Meetings of Sadsbury and Leacock, 
Meetine which up to this date had formed a part of New 
Garden Monthly Meeting, were erected into Sads- 
bury Monthly Meeting, sessions being held alter- 
nately at the two places. The Meetings of New- 
berry, Warrington, Huntington, and Menallen, in 
what is now York and Adams Counties, formed a 
part of Sadsbury Monthly Meeting, until 1747, 
when a monthly meeting of their own called War- 
rington was established. 
York and 'phe founding of the Sadsbury settlements ini- 
Counties tiated that westward migration of Friends which 
durino- the several succeedinof decades moved 
across Lancaster County to the west side of the 
Susquehanna and gave rise to the meetings in 
that part of the County which in 1749 became 
York County. By 1 727 thismovement had reached 
the east bank of the Susquehanna, at Hempfield, 
now Columbia, where in that year settled John 
Wright, Robert Barber, Samuel Blunston, and 
others. Here it was delayed for a time by the 
Cresap War rising from the boundary dispute be- 
tween the Penns and the Lords Baltimore, but 
soon it crossed to the west side of the River, and 
as early as 1738 at Newberry had begun the first 
of that belt of Quaker settlements extending across 
the northern sections of what is now York and

Adams Counties. The Irish Friends were not in 
the vanguard of the York County migration, but 
during the middle decades of the century they ar- 
rived in large numbers and figured prominently 
in the affairs of the settlements. 

New^berry ^ Meeting, during its first three or Newberry 
four years called Manchester Meeting, was in- " "^ 
eluded in Manchester Township, until in 1 742 with 
the organization of Newberry Township it fell 
in the latter.- The first settlers came from the 
meetings in southern Chester County and New 
Castle County and presented their certificates of 
removal to Sadsbury Monthly Meeting. The 
Sadsbury minutes contain an interesting account 
of the beginnings of the York County meetings 
and we shall let the records tell their own tale.

The original Newberry Meeting land, which is 
in the present village of Newberrytown, consisted 
of a hexagonal tract' of 42 acres and 61 perches, 
surveyed April 10, 1767, to John Garretson and 
Joseph Hutton, in trust for the Society of Friends. 
Our information about the early meeting-houses 
is very meagre, but the first building, which is 
said to have been of logs,' was probably erected 
on this tract. The old burial ground,^ which at 
the time of the writer's visit to the place in 1897 
was an almost impenetrable wilderness of briers 
and sumac, is all of the plot that is now owned by 
the Society. The remainder of the land and the 
meeting-house,^ which according to the inscribed 
stone in the west gable was erected in 1792,^ was

meeting-house at Warrington, and is now occupied as a dwelling, but there 
has been no material chtinge in its exterior.

sold about 181 1, by authority of a special act of 
the State Legislature,^ and the meeting was moved 
to another location about two miles from the town. 
Here a stone meeting-house was built on a five- 
acre lot sold to Jesse Wickersham and George 
Garretson, in trust for the Society, by Samuel 
Garretson and Alice his wife, by deed of 10 Mo. 
4, 1811." The meeting is now extinct, and at the 
time of my visit in 1897 the meeting-house was in 
a sad state of decay, but recently it has been re- 
covered with a slate roof and thoroughly repaired.^ 
In 1897, the graveyard presented a well-kept ap- 
pearance and was enclosed by an iron fence. 

The Newberry community received a consider- 
able body of the Irish Friends, but not so large 
as did Warrington and Menallen. Some of those 
who located at Newberry were : Timothy Kirk 
and his sons Jacob, Timothy, Caleb, Ezekiel, 
and Jonathan Kirk ; Robert Whinery, originally 
from Grange, probably near Charlemont ; Robert 
Miller and his son Samuel ; George Boyd ; Joshua 
Low ; Joseph and John Hutton ; William Wilson ; 
and several members of the Hobson family.

Nesareys and go on with Building an addishing to our Meeting house."

" at Meeting this Day we agreed with John & Jonah Thomas to Build a 
Stone End to the Meeting house and with y" Carpenters." 

For several months afterward we find Walker turning aside from his 
many other duties and actively engaged in pushing forward the building of 
the meeting-house. One day (7 Mo. 30) he goes to York for lime ; 
another he is hauling stone; and another (8 Mo. 7), he drives "to the 
pigeon hills for Lime 35 Bushels." 8 Mo. 8, " Ditto and hailing Comer 
Stone from Klihu Underwood." 8 Mo. 27 he is " hailing the -Summer 
Beam." By 9 Mo. 6, 6th day, the stone work had so far progressed that 
our diarist notes, " At our Meeting f[or] Suflfrings Raising y' New End of 
y* meeting house." 10 Mo. 14, he hauled "Shingles from y' Meeting 
house to Wm. McMuUins [brother of George McMillan] to Soak." By 
10 Mo. 21, no doubt the shingles were sufficiently soaked, and evidently 
he is returning them, when he writes under this date, " hailing Shingals 
for y" Meeting house." 

The addition was soon completed, and, I Mo. 2, 17S3, we lind the 
committee settling with " the Masons for Building y' new meeting house 
and ther is Due to them jf 44-4-0." 

Repairs on the old end were begun the following summer. 5 ^'°' ^7i 
1783, they were " Striping the old Roof of[r]," and 6 Mo. 20, " hailing 
Sleepers for the Meeting house." 8 Mo. It, they were " taking up the 
Meeting house floorc." 9 Mo. 26, Walker went "to Manahan to Allin 
Tarbuts for a Load of Boards for y* Meeting." II Mo. 17, they settled

on a wooded ridge overlooking Bermudian Creek,

early as 1745, for at Sadsbury Monthly Meeting, 
9 Mo. 4, 1745, William Garretson was directed to 
read three papers of acknowledgment "at Hunt-

old log meeting-house was taken down, removed 
about three miles to the north-west, and rebuilt in a 
more convenient place,* near Flora Dale, about one 
mile south of what is now Bendersville.' In 1884, 
the old log house gave way to the present brick 
building, erected to the rear of the former one on 
a plot of 84 perches, purchased in 1871.^ The 
Meeting is still well attended, and with the excep- 
tion of Fawn Meeting, in the south-east corner of 
York County, is the only surviving meeting of 
the original York County. 

In its early years Menallen Meeting was dis- 
tinctively an Irish meeting, the majority of its 
members being from Ireland. Among them were 
John Blackburn,* Judge of the York County Court 
in 1764, County Treasurer in 1759 and 1766,^ and 

the tract tc the Dunkers or German Baptists, at the rate of one dollar 
annually for a term of fifty years. Upon this plot the Dunkers erected a 
wooden meeting house and laid out a burial ground. The Friends con- 
tinued to make their interments in the original graveyard until 1853, when 
a piece of land adjoining the new site was purchased and another graveyard 
opened {Land Title Papers, in possession of Menallen Meeting). 

' The land for the new location, consisting of I42.4 perches, was con- 
veyed to the Meeting by Nathan Wright and Elizabeth, his wife, by deed 
of May 15, 1839, for a consideration of ;Jl7.75 and with the condition that

" Our Friends in and about York, living remote

Street was purchased from Nathan Hussey and 
Edith his wife.^ Upon this lot a brick meeting- 
house was erected in 1766.- By will, dated i 
Mo. 25. 1773, Nathan Hussey bequeathed to the 
Meeting a lot adjoining on the west. About 
17S6 the meeting-house was enlarged to its pres- 
ent proportions, an addition being made to the 
west end. The Societj^ in the city is now almost ex- 
tinct and rcijular meetinos have been discontinued. 

Among the most prominent of the Irish Friends 
to settle in York were the Loves and Kirks. 

We see, then, that the Irish Friends first lo- Expansion of

Chester. Thence, with the expansion of the 
Province, many of them joined the southward and 
westward migrations of Friends, which durino- the 
third and fourth decades of the eighteenth centurj' 
began from the Quaker strongholds of the original 
settlements. 

For three-quarters of a centur)' one of these Southuard 
streams of Quaker migration injected a new and 
vigorous element into the Quakerism of the South.^

At Western Quarterly Meeting, S Mo. II, 1767, report was made that 
" Friends in and about York have now built a Meeting- House."

Dr. Stephen B. Weeks' Southern Quakers and Slavery^ which is a most 
thorough and scholarly treatment of the subject.

1 78 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

The movement reached the Monocacy region of 
Maryland about 1725. Here it rested for a time, 
and then crossed the Potomac River and struck 
Hopewell, north of what is now Winchester, in 
Frederick County, Virginia, in 1732.^ In that 
year a company of Friends from Pennsylvania, 
under the leadership of Alexander Ross, an Irish 
Friend, settled on a tract of 100,000 acres of land, 
called Hopewell, on Opequan Creek, in the beau- 
tiful Shenandoah Valley, obtaining a charter for the 
land from the government of Virginia. A meet- 
ing called Opequan, afterward Hopewell, was es- 
tablished two years later ; and Hopewell Monthly 
Meeting, including the meetings of Hopewell and 
Monocacy, in 1735.^ Among the Pennsylvania 
Friends of Irish name who made their way to 
Hopewell we find the Kirks, Hollingsworths, Wil- 
sons, Greggs, Hiatts, and Steers. 

About the same time with the founding of the 
Hopewell settlement a branch of the same migra- 
tion moved from Maryland into Loudon and Fair- 
fax Counties, Virginia ; thence to the southern 
counties of that colony ; and by 1 743 it had gotten 
as far as Carver's Creek in Bladen County, North 
Carolina. During the next twenty years Friends 
swarmed into the central sections of the latter 
state and founded Cane Creek, New Garden, and

a large number of other monthly meetings. About 
1 760, the movement was once more on its way 
southward, and by the time of the Revolution had 
spent itself in the founding of a series of meet- 
ings in South Carolina and Georo-ia. 

Among the Friends of the Carolinas we find the 
Starrs, INIcCools, Steers, Greggs, Musgraves, 
Sharps, Hobsons, Newlins, Hadlys, Harlans, Hol- 
lingsworths, Coates', Dixons, Stanfields, Jacksons, 
Johnsons, Lindleys, Milhous', Hiatts, Hinshaws,^ 
and many other families of Irish name, formerly 
from Pennsylvania. 

By the end of the eighteenth century the south- 
ern Friends had taken such a firm stand against 
the institution of slavery, that they were no longer 
able to come into economic competition with their 
neighbors who utilized slave labor. Their situa- 
tion was rendered still more uncomfortable by the 
hostile attitude assumed by these slave-holding 
neighbors, and the passing of the century wit- 
nessed a great exodus of the Society to the newly 
opened free Northwest Territoi'y. Thousands of 
Friends, including many of Irish name originally 
from Pennsylvania, left their old homes to escape 
the hated system, and following several routes 
through Virginia and Kentucky, poured into the 
new country'. 

^The Hinshaws settled at Cane Creek, in North Carolina, several of 
them coming directly from Clrange near Charlemcnt, Ireland, and others 
from Warrington, York County, Pennsylvania.

u^estward The direct westward migration/ as previously 

narrated, reached Sadsbury, in Lancaster County, 
about 1723. By 1727 it was on the east bank of 
the Susquehanna, where it halted for a decade ; 
then with the close of the Cresap War it moved 
in full force upon York County. Here its west- 
ward course was checked for a time by the great 
barriers of the South Mountain and the Allegheny 
ranges, and by the French occupation of the west- 
ern country, and the movement was deflected 
southward into Maryland, Virginia, and the Caro- 
linas ; but with the close of the French and Indian 
War, at the Peace of Paris in 1763, the rich allu- 
vial lands of the Monongahela Valley or Redstone 
Region in Western Pennsylvania, which with the 
Mississippi Valley had now come into possession 
of the English, were thrown open to settlement, 
and once more the tide of migration was west- 
ward bound. 

From the original York County the migration 
passed to points in the Cumberland Valley, most 
detachments moving through Shippensburg. 
Here the migration divided. One branch, taking 
the less mountainous and, for a time at least, the 
more popular route, proceeded down the Cum- 
berland Valley into Maryland and then followed 
the devious course of the valley of the Potomac to

Fort Cumberland ; thence, advancing along the 
line of march of the ill-fated Braddock, it crossed 
the great ridge of the Alleghenies, and passing 
again into Pennsylvania made its v^ray over Laurel 
Hill through Beesontown,' to Redstone Old Fort, 
later Brownsville, on the Monongahela, where it 
was diffused over the valley of that river. The 
other branch, crossing an almost continuous series 
of mountain ridges, advanced directly westward 
along the old military road from Shippensburg by 
way of Fort Littleton and Bedford^ to Redstone, 
where the two branches were aeain united. 

So far as known, the first Friend to settle in the 
Redstone region was Henry Beeson, who removed 
from Berkeley County, Virginia, in i 768, and be- 
came the founder of Beesontown, now Union- 
town.^ He was soon joined by other Friends 
from Virginia, Maryland, and a little later by those 
from the eastern part of Pennsylvania ;^ and by 
1773, when the ministers John Parrish and Zebu- 
Ion Heston,^ on their return from a mission to the 

' Now Uiiiontown, Fayetle County. 

^At Dunnings Creek, near Bedford, settled Thomas Blackburn, of Men-

Ohio Indians, visited the region, several small 
Quaker settlements had been made/ In 1776, 
report was made to Warrington and Fairfax 
Quarterly Meeting that about eighteen families 
" have removed from 'different parts of this & 
the neitrhborino- Provinces & settled over the 
Alligahania Mountains"^; but the War of the 
Revolution having now begun in earnest the work 
of settlement was greatly retarded. 

In this same year of 1 7 76, the British commander 
at Detroit began to incite the Indians to attack the 
frontier of Pennsylvania, and the assaults of the 
red men upon VVheeling and the neighborhood of 
Pittsburgh in this and the following year caused 
such alarm among the settlers that large numbers, 
including some Friends, returned to their former 
homes. Margaret Cook, a minister, on her way 
to this county in the spring of 1778, mentions in 
her Journal that she and her companions " met 
some going back with their fleetings ^ driving as if 
the Indians were just behind them, and the road 
was so filled with pack horses that it was difficult 
getting along." ^ Later in this year the Quarterly 
Meeting was informed " that many of the Fami-

lies of Friends settled there have removed back to 
the Meetings from whence they went and they 
were much dispersed."' 

After the victories of George Rog^ers Clark in 
1778-79, and the subjugation of the Indians, the 
Redstone settlers feared attack no longer, and 
many of those who had fled now returned ; but 
the remainder of the war period was marked by 
few accessions of emigrants, a census of the 
Friends in these sections in 1780 showing only 
seventeen families or about one hundred and fifty 
persons.- The close of active hostilities, however, 
witnessed a great inpouring of immigrants along 
the two routes. In 1782, a meeting for worship 
and a preparative meeting were established at 
Westland, about six miles west of Redstone Fort. 
By 1785, the Quaker population had so increased 
that another meeting for worship was erected at 
Redstone, and these two meetings were formed 
into a monthly meeting called Westland. Other 
meetings soon followed, and in 1 793 a new monthly 
meeting- called Redstone was organized. 

Among the Irish Friends in the van of the 
movement, as mentioned by Parrish in h\s Journal 
of 1773, were Joseph and Anthony Blackburn and 
Simon and James McGrew, living between the two 
Sewicklys ; Solomon Shepherd and his brother

John, located near Fort Ligonier, — all from Men- 
alien ; and Barnabas McNamee and Thomas 
Greesf, near Redstone Fort, the former from Not- 
tingham and the latter from Kennett. Joshua 
Brown, travelling in 1787, speaks of Joshua 
Dixon, of Fallowfield, in what is now Washington 
County'; and Peter Yarnall, who made a visit in 
1789, mentions Alexander and Finly McGrew, of 
near the Sewicklys, and Henry Dixon on the Mo- 
nongahela.^ Other Quaker arrivals of Irish name, 
as shown by the records of Westland and Red- 
stone Monthly Meetings, were the Huttons, Pen- 
nocks, Hobsons, Newlins, McMillans, Whinerys, 
and Kirks; in fact, few Irish names were unrep- 
resented in this and the later great mitjration to 
the Middle West. 

By the opening of the nineteenth century the 
Friends became infected more strongly than ever 
with the prevailing spirit of migration, and again 
we find them on the westward march. A stream 
of migration more powerful than any of the pre- 
ceding, arising to considerable extent from new 
sources in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and 
even New York, now flowed in a steady current 
through the two well-worn channels to the gate- 
way of the Redstone region, where, gathering new

strength, it moved to the River Ohio and spread out 
over the broad and fertile plains of the Old North- 
west. Here, mingling with the great stream of 
Quakers from the South, it gave rise to many new 
meetings, almost if not equaling in number those 
of the Atlantic seaboard, and became an important 
factor in the formation and development of the 
great commonwealths of the Mississippi Valley. 



CHAPTER II. 

SOCIAL LIFE OF THE IRISH FRIENDS 



O' 



Introductory /^~\ F the social Conditions among the Irish 
Friends in early Pennsylvania some idea 
will have been formed from the preceding 
chapters, particularly from Robert Parke's long 
letter' ; now let us consider this phase of our 
history more in detail, dwelling especially upon 
some of the more important sides of country life. 
The diaries, wills, and inventories of the time, 
and the ancient records of Friends, abound in 
quaint and interesting items reflecting the man- 
ners and customs of the period, and it is these rich 
stores chiefly that have been drawn upon. On 
many points, however, authentic material was not 
at hand, and this in part accounts for the some- 
what inadequate and fragmentary character of 
portions of the chapter. 
Irish Friends The Irish Friends were an active and enlerpris- 
iveii Adapted j^g people, particularly well adapted for pioneer 
Li/e life, doubtless more so than the English and Welsh 

Friends ; for the unsetded state of Ireland through 
so long a period, — that of the Cromwellian Settle- 
ment, the raids of the Rapparees, the troubles

between James II. and William III., and the re- 
ligious persecutions and other causes of emigra- 
tion — had inured them to privation and hardship 
and prepared them to contend with the difficulties 
of the new country. 

Although the majority of these Friends were of Mostly of 
English stock, yet those families that had been in tj'uf Modified 
Ireland for a generation or more had become by insit eh- 
modified by their Irish environment and by con- 
tact with their restless and aggressive Celtic- and 
Scotch-Irish neighbors, developing habits and 
characteristics that distinguished them from the 
English Friends of the Province. 

These characteristics crop out in the old meet- 
ing records, which show that the younger Irish 
Friends especially were impulsive and full of 
spirit, chafing under the restraint of the strict and 
repressive discipline of the Society as enforced 
in those days ; and it is quite common, as we shall 
see, to find them "marrying out by y" priest" 
and otherwise breaking the rules. In this con- 
nection it is also worthy of note that in those 
meetinofs in which the Irish element was strong- 
there was a tendency to be more liberal in belief 
and less string-ent in the administration of some 
of the rules of discipline. 

In those neighborhoods where the clan spirit 
was strong, and where most of the marriages oc- 
curred among their own number, these Friends

preserved much of their Irish identity for genera- 
tions ; but by the early years of the nineteenth cen- 
tur}- they had lost much of this peculiarit)' and were 
becoming rapidly absorbed in the new composite 
American race. 

On their first arrival from Ireland, and before 
their own homes could be provided, immigrant 
Friends did not want for food and shelter ; in that 
era of simple kindliness and free-hearted hospi- 
tality the old settlers were ever ready with open 
door to receive the newcomers and to assist and 
counsel them in choosing a location. The great 
body of these Friends brought only small capital 
with them, but they were young and vigorous and 
the favorable opportunities offered here enabled 
the most of them to begin a fairly comfortable 
settlement. Men with families usually brought 
their household goods with them, purchasing in 
the Colony, horses, cattle, and such other neces- 
saries that could be bought to better advantage 
on this side of the water. 

It was customary for those Friends who in- 
tended to establish themselves upon inland planta- 
tions, first to provide temporary' homes for their 
families near the place of landing, and then to go, 
often several in a company, prospecting for farm 
land in the interior. 

Ties of kin and of friendship had an important 
bearing on the selection of lands ; those who had

and in consequence we find such distinctive Irish Ties 0/ Kin 
Quaker settlements as those of Newark and "pricdskip 
Centre in New Castle County, New Garden in 
Chester County, Sadsbury in Lancaster County, 
and Menallen in the original York County. 

Once the land was selected and steps taken to joumeyto 
secure the title thereto, usually by warrant^ from ■* ''' 
the Proprietary, haste was made to remove the 
families thither so that the settlement might be 
well advanced before the winter season had 
begun.- Pack-horses, almost the only means of 
transportation, were now made ready with saddles 
and pillions, and the women and children and farm 
and household effects were loaded upon them, 
the men frequently travelling on foot, leading the 
horses and driving the flocks and herds before 
them. Thus equipped the little procession would 
set off through the dark and lonely woods, follow- 

' The planter applied at the land office for the warrant, which was 
issued by the Proprietary, or the Commissioners, and addressed to the Re- 
ceiver-General, authorizing that official to have a survey made on terms 
described in the document. The warrant then passed to the Surveyor- 
General, who made a copy, returning the original to the warrantee to be 
held as evidence of title until the patent was issued. The Sur\-ey or- General 
gave the copy of the warrant with an order to the Deputy -Surveyor of the 
county in which the land was located, directing the suney to be made. 
After the Deputy-Surveyor had completed his measurements, he reported to 
the office of the Surveyor-General, who then issued a patent to the pur- 
chaser of the land. It usually happened that the patent was not issued 
until some years after the warrant.

ing the Indian trails and the paths marked by 
blazed trees to the new abode. 

The site of the dwelling on the plantation was 
generally near a spring of water, either on low 
ground or on the warm southern slope of a hill, 
for the sake of protection from the bleak and 
piercing winds of winter. With an energy and 
enthusiasm born of the thought that they were no 
longer tenants but absolute owners of the soil, 
the whole family now worked to win a home from 
the unconquered wilds. The trees fell quickly 
under the sturdy blows of the woodman's sharp- 
edged axe, and soon a little clearing appeared 
amidst the encircling forest. The next concern 
was the erection of a house. This first habitation 
was only a rude cabin built of timber hewn and 
sawed by hand from the fallen trees ; but before 
many years had elapsed, with the large increase 
that blessed his labors, the farmer was enabled to 
erect a more comfortable and commodious dwell- 
ing of brick or stone, often making it an addition 
to the original house. 

There were several methods of constructing the 
first wooden house. One of those suggested by 
Pennin his Directions to Such Persons as are iuclitied 
to America,^ issued about 1682, was doubtless 
followed by many of the early settlers. He writes :-

To build then, an House of thirty foot long and eighteen foot broad, 
with a partition neer the middle, and an other to divide one end of the 
House into two small Rooms, there must be eight Trees of about sixteen 
Inches square, and cut off, to Posts of about fifteen long, which the House 
must stand upon, and four pieces, two of thirty foot long, and two o< 
eighteen foot long, for Plates, which must lie upon the top of those 
Posts, t!ie whole length and breadth of the House, for the Gists to rest 
upon. There must be ten Gists of twenty foot long, to bear the Loft, and 
two false Plates of thirty foot long to lie upon the ends of the Gists for the 
Rafters to be fixed upon, twelve pare of Rafters of about twenty foot, to 
bear the Roof of the House, with several other small pieces ; as Wind- 
beams, Braces, Studs, etc. which are made out of the Waste Timber. 
For Covering the House, Ends, and Sides, and for the Ijoft, we use Clab- 
board, which is Rived feather- edged, of five foot and a half long, that 
well Drawn, lyes close and smooth : The Lodging Room may be lined 
with the same, and filled up between, which is very Warm. These homes 
usually endure ten years without Repair. . . . The lower flour is the Ground, 
the upper Clabboard. This may seem a mean way of Building but 'tis 
sufficient and safest for ordinary beginners. 

Dankers and Sluyter' the Dutch Labadists, on 
their journey from New York to the Delaware, in 
1679, met with this form of house at the Falls of 
Delaware, now Trenton, New Jersey, and have left 
the following description : 

Nov. 17th. — Most of the English, and many others, have their houses 
made of nothing but clapboards, as they call them there, in this manner : 
they first made a wooden frame, the same as they do in Westphalia, and 
at Altona, but most so strong ; they then split the boards of clapboard, 
50 that they are like cooper's pipe staves, except they are not bent. These 
are made very thin with a large knife, so that the thickest end is about a 
pinck (little finger) thick, and the other is made sharp, like the edge of a 
knife. They are about five or six feet long, and are nailed on the outside 
of the frame, with the ends lapped over each other. They are not 
usually laid so close together, as to prevent you from sticking a finger be- 
ween them, in consequence either of their not being well joined, or the 
boards being crooked. When it is cold and windy the best people plaster

them with clay. Such are most all the English houses in the country, ex- 
cept those they have which were built by people of other nations. Now 
this house was new and airy ; and as the night was very windy from the 
north, and extremey cold. 

This description is confirmed in " An Account of East Jersey, in 1684" : ' 

" They build not only of Wood, but also of .Stone and brick, yet most of 

Country Houses are built of Wood only Trees split and set up on end on the 

ground, and coverings to their Houses are mostly Shingles made of Oak, 

Chestnut and Cedar Wood, which makes a very neat covering : " 

The most common form of the early dwell- 
ing, however, was the more permanent log 
The Lng Cabin," built of squared logs, placed horizontally 
House ^j^g upon the other and notched together at the 
corners. The interstices between the logs were 
filled in or "chinked" with stones or wedges of 
wood, and then plastered over with mortar or 
clay. The roof was covered with boards or oak 
shingles, either pinned by wooden pins or pegs or 
held in place by "weight timbers."^ Says Ash- 

' Hart's American I/islory told by Contemporaries, I., 569. 

^Dankers and Sluyter {^Memoirs L. I. Hist. Soc., I., 175) in their 
journey of 1679, give an account of the log house of Jacob Hendricks, a 
Swede, of Burlington, New Jersey, stating that it was '^ made according 
to the Swedish mode, and as they usually build their houses here, which 
are block houses, being nothing else than entire trees, split through the 
middle, or squared out of the rough, and placed in the form of a square, 
upon each other, as high as they wish to have the house ; the ends of these 
timbers are let into each other, about a foot from the ends, half of one into 
half of the other. The whole structure is thus made, without a nail or a 
spike. The ceiling and roof do not exhibit much finer work, except 
among the most careful people, who have the ceiling planked and a glass 
window. The doors are wide enough, but very low, so that you have to 
stoop in entering. These houses are quite light and warm ; but the chim- 
ney is placed in a corner."

mead : ^ "Locks in ordinary use were unknown ; 
the doors [were hung- on wooden hinges or straps 
of hide and] were opened by strings, which on be- 
ing pulled from the outside raised heavy wooden 
latches within, to which they were made fast, and 
intrusion was prevented when the inmates pulled 
the latch-strings in at the outer doors. From this 
common practice originated the ancient saying 
descriptive of generous hospitality, ' the latch- 
string is always out.' " 

A stone chimney of immense size, capable of Equipment of 
receiving a whole cord stick on the hearth, was ^^^^ 
built into one end of the house. The great fire- 
place was used for cooking and heating. Here 
were to be found frying-pans, chafing-dishes, and The Hearth 
spits, and suspended over the andirons by pot- 
hooks from an iron bar or crane, were the pots 
and kettles, which were so highly prized by the 
settlers that they were frequently bequeathed by 
will. George Harlan, of Kennett, in his will of 
1 714, devised to his son Aaron a "great brass 
kettle," and William Halliday, of New Garden, in 
1 741, left "unto my Daughter Deborah Lindly 
my big pott that I brought from Ireland." We 
may be sure that his bequest was all the more 
highly regarded because it had come over sea.

The great hearth fire was the center of attrac- 
tion in the long winter evenings. Its dancing 
flames filled the room with good cheer, throwing 
into the shadow the bare and homely outlines and 
lighting up with gentle touch the prominent fea- 
tures, — the rude furniture, the floor bare save for 
a rug or two, the overhanging beams, the mantel 
bright with pewter and brass,' and the walls un- 
adorned excepting perhaps for a map or sampler 
or a fowling-piece. Here by the fireside the 
household and perhaps a few neighbors would 
assemble to enjoy the evening fire and to chat of 
affairs of common interest and to exchange the 
marvelous stories current in those days ; but no one 
has equalled the gentleWhittier in giving the spirit 
of this scene of domestic peace and contentment : 

Shut in from all the world without, 
We sat the clean- winged hearth about. 
Content to let the north-wind roar 
In baffled rage at ])ane and door, 
Wliile the red logs before us beat 
The frost-line back with tropic heat ; 
And ever, when a louder blast 
Shook beam and rafter as it passed, 
The merrier up its roaring draught 
The great throat of the chimney laughed ; 
The -house-dog on its paws outspread 
Laid to the fire his drowsy head,

The cat's dark silhouette on the wall 
A couchant tiger's seemed to fall ; 
And, for the winter fireside meet, 
Between the andirons' straddling feet. 
The mug of cider simmered slow, 
The apples sputtered in a row, 
And, close at hand, the basket stood 
With nuts from brown October's wood. 

What matter how the night behaved ? 
What matter how the north -wind raved ? 
Blow high, blow low, not all its snow 
Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow.'

The absence of the items of furniture such

other inventories of the time, seems due to the 
fact that much of tlie furniture was of such crude 
construction, that it was not considered worthy of 
inclusion in the list. John Miller, yeoman and

dinner table in 1 7 1 4. The rough home-made ^«*'^. ^7^4 
board with its supporting trestles was covered with 
snowy cloth — board-cloth — and napkins of linen, 
spun, woven, and bleached by the good house- 
wife, doubtless, in her old home in Ireland. The 
dishes were mostly of wood with some few pieces 
of pewter, always kept bright and shining. The 
center-piece was the salt-cellar, which in many 
colonial homes divided the guests, seated "above 
the salt," from those of lesser note, placed "below 
the salt." Large shallow pewter platters were 
heaped high with meats and vegetables. Wooden 
trenchers served as plates, and wooden noggins as 
drinking cups ; and mustard cup, wooden tank- 
ards for water or liquor, and pewter porringers 
likewise graced the board. There were no cov- 
ered dishes, saucers, glass or china, although 
earthenware was to be found on some tables. 

1 From evidence of old diaries the sickle seems to have been used in 
Chester County up to the Revolution, and then the grain-cradle was intro- 
duced. Richard Barnard, of East Marlborough, on a visit to Deer Creek, 
Harford County, Md., notes in his manuscript diary, 6 Mo. 4, 1775, that 
he " observed a Creadle to Cradle wheat," and on 7 Mo. loth we find him 
engaged " about Cradle to Cradle wheat." On the 24th of the same month 
Samuel Hunt (see Fuihey and Cope, 338), of East Cain, records that 
" Leathe Ingram began to Cradle Oats at Is. 6 d. pr acre & I Pint of Rum 
a Day."

Knives were used, but forks did not come into 
general use until later, so that the hands had to be

Dress The dress of the Friends in the early years of 
Pennsylvania differed but little from that of the 
other settlers of the same class. It was not until 
the close of the first quarter of the eighteenth 
century that F"riends began to make an effecti\e 
protest against extravagance in apparel and to 
adopt a more formal costume'- of "home-spun

drab and gray." The clothing of the planters 
was generally simple and substantial, coarse cloth 
and deerskin being used for that of the men, and 
linsey and worsted for that of the women. The 
costume of a man consisted of leather breeches, 
loner collarless coat reachinof to the knees, waist- 
coat, neck cloth, woolen yarn stockings, low buckle 
shoes, and a flat felt or beaver hat. Often in 
summer, breeches made of a coarse linen called 
osenbrig were worn. Robert Parke, in his letter 
of 1725, writes : 

In Summer time they wear nothing but a Shirt & Linnen Trousers, 
which are breeches and stockings all in one made of Linnen, they are fine 
Cool wear in Summer. 

Wigs were worn by many Friends Penn at- 
tended carefully to his wigs, and purchased several 
during his short stay here. In a letter from Lon- 
don in 1702, he writes to Logan : " Did not a fine 
new wig come to thy hands for me ? It cost me 
fifty shillings sterling."^ In 17 19, Jonathan 
Dickinson, a Friend, in writing to London for his 
clothes, says: "I want for myself and my three 
sons, each a wig, light good bobs." ^ The Friends 
to a larore extent had laid aside their "Wip^grs" 
some time before the middle of the century, but 
the fashion was kept up in general society until 
1755 ; then, with the return of Braddock's de-

feated army, who had lost their wigs in flight, the 
custom was abandoned. 

Some of the wealthy Friends of Philadelphia 
had large and costly wardrobes for that time, as, 
for example, that of Robert Turner, one of the 
richest of the settlers, enumerated m his inven- 
tory,' made after his death, in 1 700 :

In 1726, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting took a 
decided position on the subject of plainness of 
apparel, the women in particular being advised to 
greater simplicity in such matters as follows : 

"That immodest fashion of hooped petticoats, or the immitation of 
them, either by something put into their petticoats to make them set full

be of rabbit's fur. In 168S, "Of Hats . . . the Caster is made of Coney

or wearing more than is necessar)', or any imitation whatsoever, which we 
take to be but a brancli springing from the same corrupt root of pride. 
And also that none of our friends accustom themselves to wear gowns with 
superfluous folds behind but plain and decent ; nor without aprons ;' nor to 
wear superfluous gathers or plaits in their caps or pinners ; nor to wear 
their heads dressed high behind ; neither to cut or lay their hair on their 
foreheads or temples. 

And that ffriends be careful to avoid striped shoes, or red or white 
heeled shoes or clogs ; or shoes trinmed with gaudy colors. 

Likewise that all ffriends be careful to avoid all superfluity of ffumiture 
in their houses, and as much as may be to refrain using gaudy flowers or 
striped calicoes and stufls. 

And .also that no ffriends use that irreverant practice of taking snuff, or 
hand snuft-boxes one to the other in meetings. 

Also that ffriends avoid the unnecessary use of fans in meetings, lest it 
divert the mind from more inward and spiritual e.xercise which all ought to 
be concerned in. 

And also that ffriends do not accustom themselves to go with breasts or 
bare necks. ^ 

Thehighdegree of interdependence and division workon 
of labor that characterizes ourmodern life was quite f^^P""^ 
unknown in these early days. At that time every 
farm house was a little factory and every farmer 
an adept in many branches of labor, and independ- 
ent to a considerable extent of the outside world. 
In summer the farmer and his sons were busily 
engaged in clearing and planting the land ; in 
winter, if the weather were too severe for outside 
work, they applied themselves to indoor labors, 
making shoes for the family, beating out imple- 
ments of iron or constructincr household furniture 
and utensils. 

' It was the custom of the women to wear green aprons.

The wife and daughters were even more fully 
occupied than the men. They not only attended 
to a score or more of domestic duties — cookinof, 
washing, dairying, candle-making, soap-making, 
spinning, knitting, and weeding the garden — 
but also frequently assisted the men in the work 
of the field ; and in truth they might say with the 

old adage, Man works from sun to sun, 

But woman's work is never done. 

The women devoted much time to the home- 
spun industries, picking, carding, and spinning 
wool, and swingling, hatcheling and spinning llax ; 
and from their own homespun they manufactured 
the clothing of the family. The large stores of 
linen that were produced by this industr)' were 
folded away with lavender in wooden chests, and 
were a source of much pride to the colonial house- 
wife. Beautiful specimens of the linen made by 
the Irish Friends are still treasured as heirlooms in 
the families of descendants, and attest that the an- 
cient skill in the handicraft for which Ireland is 
famous was not forgotten in the foster land. 
Markets The produce of the farm was carried to Phila- 
delphia, Chester, and New Castle, on horseback, 
and sold or exchanged for articles to be found 
at shops, fairs, and markets. Parke writes, in 
1725: "There is 2 fairs yearly & 2 markets 
weekly in I'iiiladclphia also 2 fairs yearly in 
Chester & Likewise in New Castle, but they Sell 



and Fairs

no Cattle nor horses no Living Creatures but al- 
together Merchants Goods, as hatts, Linen & 
woolen Cloth, handkerchiefs, knives, Scizars, tapes 
& treds, buckels, Ribonds & all Sorts of neces- 
sarys fit for our wooden Country." He humor- 
ously adds : " & here all young men and women 
that wants wives or husbands may be Supplyed. 
Lett this suffice for our fairs." 

The early settlers were much annoyed by cer- wna Animals 
tain of the wild animals that preyed on their flocks 
and herds. Fo.xes and wolves were the most 
persistently destructive, but black bears also fre- 
quently stole into the farm yard and carried off 
fine porkers. In 1721, a bear was killed near 
Darby, now Delaware County, and yet ten or 
fifteen years later, when Nathaniel Newlin (son of 
Nathaniel), of Concord, married Esther Midkiff, of 
Darby, her parents were inclined to make objec- 
tions because Newlin lived in the backwoods of 
Concord where bears abounded. Mrs. Deborah 
Logan relates that one night in 1740-41, one of 
these animals was seen at the old Loran home in 

o 

Chester.^ The family of Alphonsus Kirk, the 
early Irish Quaker settler, of New Castle County, 
had a thrilling experience with a bear. A grand- 
daughter of Alphonsus Kirk, Rachael Price, a min- 
ister of Birmingham Meeting, Chester County, 
tells the story in her Recollections .-"^

2o8 hmnigration of i/ic IrisJi Quakers 

A Bear Story My father, William Kirk (son of Alpbonsus and Abigail Kirk) was 

born 1st mo., 1708. He and his youngest brother Timothy, had many ad- 
ventures together when they were young ; they used frequently to meet 
and talk these over, which was very entertaining to us children. One oc- 
currence, however, which took place in their childhood, and which I heard 
my father relate, struck my infant mind with horror and dismay. It so 
happened that my grandmother was left at home with only these two little 
boys when a large bear came up near the door before she saw it. It was 
a double door, and she had only time to shut the lower part before he had 
his feet upon it, and she could not get the upper door shut quickly, as 
there was something hanging on it that prevented the door from closing. 
She pushed it against his paws with all her strength and called to the little 
boys to bring her the a.\e which was in the house, but they could not find 
it; then she told them to bring her the rolling pin, with which she beat 
his feet until he withdrew them, when she could get the door fastened. 
He then attempted to climb on a shed which was over the door, and which 
extended to a window in the second story. She seeing his determination 
told her little sons to go to the cellar and get into a chest that was there, 
but not to shut down the lid so tightly they could not breathe, while she 
went up stairs to keep him out, if possible. The shed was built of round 
saplings, which were covered with brush (wood) and a light snow. .Some 
of these rolled under the clumsy creature and let him fall through. They 
had killed a beef that day, the smell of which had probably attracted him ; 
she threw some parts of it to him which he devoured with great eagerness, 
appearing to be very hungry, and then went off. 

The next morning several men went in search of him ; his foot being 
wounded the blood upon the snow enabled them to track him, so that they 
soon came up to him. Grandfather's .stout dogs attacked him with violence, 
but the bear seeming likely to gain the victory, he went to their assistance 
with his axe. In the meantime the eldest son and the rest of the company 
came up, and seeing the scuffle but not that his father was there, [the son] 
incautiously raised his gun in order to fire, but his companions called to 
him in time to prevent it. They soon succeeded in killing the bear. 

Social Colonial farm life was not all a monotonous 

Intercourse rQi,ncl of labor and care ; time was also found for 

social enjoyment. The Irish Friends, as well as 

other members of the Society, were eminently a 

sociable people, and despite the hard travelling.

visited each other continually. All the events of 
community — harvests, huskings, raisings, vendues, 
meetings, weddings, funerals — brought the widely 
scattered neiijhbors together in social mincrlino^. 
On such occasions a spirit of sincere and hearty 
good-will and neighborliness generally prevailed, 
and in time of distress and need there was never 
lack of help and sympathy. 

A great event among the Friends was a wed- it^eddings 
ding. The first and important preliminary to the 
marriage was " to pass meeting," or obtain the 
consent of the monthly meeting. To this end the 
contracting parties appeared in two monthly meet- 
ings and declared their intentions. Then, after 
a searching inquiry by a committee, if the couple 
were found to be " clear of all entangflements," 
they were lett at liberty to accomplish their marri- 
age, according to "y' good order," of Friends. As 
an example of a "passing" of the Irish Friends the 
following extracts from the minutes of New Garden 
Monthly Meeting, Chester County, are given :

The friends y' were Appointed To See y* orderly Accomplishment of 
Thomas Jackson & Mary Willeys Marriage, Make report That it was Ac 
complished orderly. 

It often happened that marriages were not cele- 
brated with that high degree of good order which 
the committee thought necessary at such func- 
tions. There seems to have been a constant ten- 
dency, especially after the fourth decade of the 
century, to bring some of the ways of the "world's 
people" into the marriage ceremony. In 1761, at 
Warrington Monthly, a marriage was reported 
orderly, except for the couple^ " having a man & 
maid to wait on them, which practice this meeting 
doth not approve." In 1773, at the said Monthly 
Meeting, a groom- was complained of for having 
"assistance in taking of his Gloves." In 1775, 
the nuptials of Richard Atherton and Phebe Hob- 
son seem to have passed off to the satisfaction of 
the men Friends of the meeting, but the women 
members were scandalized at the presence of 
"assistants to pull off the glove "and hat." In 
1785, Friends had a concern as to the "practice 
of keeping on the Hat at the time of Solemnizing 
Marriage."* 

Many young Friends, impatient of the slow and 
troublesome process of passing meeting, would

hasten off to "ye priest" or to a magistrate, and be 
married without any delay or formality. Ancient 
church registers, notably those of the Old Swedes' 
Churches of Philadelphia and Wilmington, record 
the marriages of many young runaway Quaker 
couples. The monthly meeting minutes abound 
in the record of such infractions of discipline, and 
the elders of the meeting were ever busy laboring 
and dealing with the delinquents. If the offend- 
ers would not confess their faults they were " dis- 
owned " or expelled from the Society. At New 
Garden Monthly Meeting, in 1730, a complaint 
was made that " Mary Moore ^ is gone out from 
friends & is Marryed by a Justice of y° peace 
Contraiy to freinds advice to her." For this she 
was disowned. 

At the same meeting in 1 736, " John Mickle is 
married out by y" priest," and was disowned. 
Again, in 1737, "Sadsbury preparative Meeting 
informs y' John Musgrove Jun' is married out of y" 
Unity of friends (by y^ priest.) ' " He was then ex- 
pelled. At Warrington Monthly Meeting, in 1767, 
Sarah Delap made a written acknowledgment " for 
keeping company with a young man not of our So- 
ciety and attempting marriage with him by a priest 
to the great grief of my tender parents." She was 
then re-instated. Even those members who were 
present on the occasion of a marriage by " ye

priest " were dealt with for misconduct. Such 
complaints as this are frequent in the minutes : 
New Garden Monthly Meeting, 12 Mo. 22, 1734-5, 
is informed " y' Thos. Jackson Jun"' went a Long 
with Stephen Hayes when he went & gott mar- 
ried by y' priest." 

Warrington Monthly Meeting, in 1779, had 
a difficult love affair to settle. John Uclap made 
objections to the marriage proposals of Joseph 
Garretson and Rebecca McMillan, declaring that 
he had a prior claim to her "which he is not will- 
ing to give up, and it appears that she kept com- 
pany with him a considerable time after she al- 
tered her mind." The meedng finally decided 
against poor John, and the marriage was duly con- 
summated without any further interruption from 
him. 

The bride would ride to meeting behind her 
father or next friend seated on a pillion, but 
after the ceremony the pillion was transferred to 
the husband's horse, behind his saddle, and witli 
him she rode home.^ After the wedding the com- 
pany were invited to return to the home of the 
bride's father, where a bountiful repast was served. 
Great preparations were made for the wedding 
dinner, and Friends had frequently to be cau-

tioned against lavish entertainment on such occa- 
sions. At Warrington, in 1767, a marriage was 
reported orderly, "Except some unnecessary pro- 
vision." ' 

Courtship among Friends was a solemn affair, Courtship 
and must be pursued in a most decorous and cir- 
cumspect manner. Before declaring his affec- 
tions, the young man must first have the consent 
of the young woman's parents. This permission 
granted, he came "a courting," but he must strive 
by his grave and staid demeanor and "solid con- 
versation" to make an impression on the object of 
his regards. If however, he did not first obtain 
the paternal sanction, he was dealt with by the 
meeting. In 1726, George Robinson ^ had to sign 
the following paper before he was allowed to 
proceed with his marriage : 

Whereas I have Made My Mind Known to Mary M'Koy Upon y' 
Account of Marriage before I had her parents Consent Contrary to y" order 
of friends for which I am Sory as witnes my hand

Funerals A funeral was always an occasion for a great 
gathering of Friends. Thomas Chalkley notes 
that in 1725 as many as a thousand persons were 
present at a funeral.' The body was placed in a 
plain coffin and borne to the meeting-house, where 
after a short meeting in memory of the deceased, 
interment was made in the adjoining graveyard. 
The company then repaired to the house for din- 
ner, which was almost as elaborate a repast as 
that served at weddings. Friends were warned 
to " keep out of superfluity at maredges and 
bueriels." The funeral expenses of fames Lind-

filed by his executors, were ^4. los., and " y«

The meeting was one of the strongest forces in Meetings fot 
the social life of the Friends. Twice a week, on 
"First-day " and usually on "Fifth-day," it brought 
together the members from their scattered hold- 
ings for worship, and at the close afforded oppor- 
tunity for a short season of quiet and genial con- 
verse. Of the two meetings for worship, that of 
the Sabbath had the better attendance. On 

Fair First-day mornings steeped in Summer calm 
Warm, tender, restful, sweet with woodland balm, 

family parties, either walking or riding,^ might be

carry themselves with that degree of " gravity and moderation " that was

seen wending their way to the plain little meeting- 
house, embowered amid the trees. Reining up 
by the horse-block at the door the riders dis- 
mounted, and before entering the edifice would 
linger, perchance, for a few words of friendly 
greeting with the neighbors. There was no 

peal of bells to call them to the house of praise, 

but at the appointed time the company took their 
places on the hard, unpainted benches, the men 
on the one side and the women on the other side 
of the house. After a few moments of silent and 
reverent worship, seeking 

The Soul's communion with the Eternal Mind, — 

from the raised seats of the gallery, where sat the 
ministers and elders facing the body of the meet- 
ing a minister would arise to deliver his spiritual 
message. Frequently the speaker was a travel- 
ling Friend, from England or Ireland or other dis- 
tant parts. Perhaps it was Thomas Chalkley, 

Gentlest of skippers, rare sea saint,' , 

or Thomas Lightfoot, who 

expected of them by their elders, but took advantage of the ride to show ofi 
the paces of their fine young horses. As early as 1681, Friends of Dublin 
Half Year Meeting had a concern as to this departure from " y' path of 
truth" and sent an epistle, signed by William Edmundson, Abraham Ful- 
ler, and Amos Strettell, to Friends on the Delaware, urging that "all 
young Men and others in Riding to or from Meetings or other occasions 
refrain from Galloping and Riding after an aiery flurting manner." — Amelia

or perchance it was quaint and eccentric old John 
Salkcld, of Chester, of whom a contemporary 
writes, in 1739 : 

Salkeld from silent sitting slow would rise 
And seemed as with himself he did advise. 
His first words would be soft, but might be heard ; 
He looked resolved, yet spoke as if he feared 



Proposed his theme, and sometimes would repeat, 
Lest some should not observe, or should forget : 

Thus louder then he strained his cheerful voice, 
The sounds grow tuneful and their hearts rejoice.* 

It not infrequently happened that some good 
Friends, wearied with the arduous duties of the 
week, would drop off into restful slumber. But 
woe betide these offenders of good order and the 
testimony of truth, if John Salkeld chanced to be 
present at the meeting ! Their dreams were then 
of short duration. On one occasion, it is related, 
when he noted several members overcome with 
drowsiness, he suddenly sprang to his feet, ex- 
claiming, "Fire! Fire!" Everyone was awake

immediately and one of the excited sleepers cried 
out, "Where? Where?" "In Hell!" responded 
|ohn, "to burn up the drowsy and uncon- 
cerned." ' 

The close of meeting was announced by the 
shaking of hands by two gallery Friends, the 
signal passing down seat by seat through the 
house. After a friendly and genial chat the 
Friends dispersed, many of them taking guests 
home to dinner. 

The business meetings of the Society, from the 
point of view of social opportunity, were of greater 
moment even than the meetings for worship. The 
latter were usually only local in extent, but the 
former, especially the quarterly and yearly meet- 
ings, brought together large numbers of Friends 
from many distant points and thus enlarged and 
broadened the range of social intercourse. The 
business meeting was usually preceded by a meet- 
ing for worship, at the close of which wooden 
shutters were drawn down from the ceiling, leav- 
ing the women to conduct their branch of the 
meeting separate from that of the men. 
Quarterly The Quarterly Meeting, which continued often 
"'"'^ for several days, and in early times "circulated" 
to various fixed places in a district, occupied a 
conspicuous place in the life of the I'riends. The

season was looked forward to with pleasant an- 
ticipation by young and old as a time not only for 
religious worship but for social pleasure. Great 
preparations in the way of cooking and baking 
were made for Quarterly Meeting guests. Whole 
families would often come from great distances to 
"Quarterly" and visit around in the neighbor- 
hood during the progress of the meeting. 

Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, the central au- V'-ariy 
thority, to which all the other meetings of Pennsyl- ' " '"^ 
vania, Delaware, and parts of New Jersey and 
Maryland were subordinate, was the most impor- 
tant of the meetings and had the largest attend- 
ance. The meeting lasted for upwards of a week 
each year, oscillating for a time between Philadel- 
phia and Burlington, but finally settling down to 
regular sessions in Philadelphia. Country Friends 
took advantage of Yearly Meeting week to bring 
to town farm products, to exchange for articles to 
be found in the shops and markets. The visitors 
were always received and entertained with gener- 
ous hospitality by the city members. 

The Monthly Meeting, local in its character, was jironihiy 
the real working body of the Society, in matters ^'''"'^'"^ 
relatincr to the individual members. It " under- 
took to see that justice was done between man 
and man, that disputes were settled, that the poor 
were supported, that delinquents, whether as to 
the Society's own rules or those of the State, were 



2 2 2 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

reformed, or if reformation seemed impossible, 
were ' disowned ' by the Society, that appHcants 
for membership were tested and finally, if satisfac- 
tory, received, that all the children were educated, 
that certificates of sfood standing were orranted to 
members changing their abodes, that marriages 
and burials were simply and properly performed, 
and that records were fully and accurately kept. 
Under these were the Preparative Meetings."' 
Meeting The Friends in general maintained a high 

^"^ ° standard of conduct and morality, but among the 
young members, especially in the later genera- 
tions, there was a falling off in this respect and a 
tendency to drift into the ways of the world's 
people. The monthly meeting was constantly 
engaged in laboring with offenders. 

Some additional e.xtracts from the meeting 
records throw light on disciplinary action and af- 
ford further interesting glimpses of the manner of 
life among the Irish PViends. 
Card-piayini; The Friends had a strong testimony against 
"oan in ^"^'^ ' kicked practices " as card-playing and 

dancing, their sentiments being expressed by 
Thomas Chalkley, who denounces cards as "en- 
gines of Satan " and declares " that as many Paces 
as the Person takes in the Dance, so many Paces 
or Steps they take towards Hell."'' But in spite

* Journal^ 225, 



Social Life of the Irish Friends 223 

of all such protests many young members were 
found playing cards and engaging in such "vain 
and vicecious Proseedings as Frollicking Fiddling 
and Dancingr." 

At New Garden Monthly Meeting, 4mo. 1 2, 
1725: 

" New Garden Preparative Meeting has Acquainted this Meeting y' 
Neheniiah Hutton has been found In Company keeping & playing Cards 
which lias brought reproach upon truth & friends, & this Meeting has put 
him upon to Draw iip Something for y* Clearing of truth Against y® Next 
Monthly Meeting which he Acknowledges and is willing to do 

" Joseph Hadley being Also in Company w' Nehemiah Hutton and had 
y' Cards In his hand which he is Sory for y' he did not leave y* Company. 
It is y* Mind of this Meeting y' he condemn the Same So far as he is 
Guilty" 

6 Mo., 6, 1725. " Nehemiah Hutton has given in a paper Condemn- 
ing himself for his playing at Cards which paper this meeting receives & 
orders him to read y' S'? Paper in y' place where he was playing & in y* 
Presents of Benjamin ffred & Willf Halliday & that they give an Account 
to y" next Monthly Meeting & that he is desired to forbear coming to meet- 
ings of business until friends be better Satisfied with him as to his conver- 
sation and .Sincerity to truth." Joseph Hadley was dealt with in the same 
way. 

At Warrington Monthly Meeting, in 1769, 
Timothy Kirk acknowledged his error in dancing, 
and in 1777, Elizabeth Blackburn expressed her 
sorrow for "having Endeavored to dance." 

The Friends, in common with other people of 
the early part of the period under our study, seem 
to have indulged freely in strong drink. The Tem- Drinking. 
perance movement, which was initiated by Friends, 
was of later origin. So long as members kept 
sober no complaint was made, but when they got 



2 24 /mini oration of the Irish Quakers 

so deep in their cups as to become foolish and be- 
ligerent they were promptly taken in hand by the 
meeting. It was thought that no crop could be gar- 
nered, no building raised, in fact no difficult work 
accomplished, without the use of stimulants. On all 
social occasions liquor was freely passed around. 

In 1725, Chester Quarterly Meeting, which in- 
cluded nearly all the meetings of what is now New 
Castle County in Delaware, and the counties of 
Delaware and Chester in Pennsylvania, made 
some attempt to correct abuses that had sprung 
up. " It was desired [that] y" friends take care at 
Burralls not to make great provision as to provide 
strong Liquors and hand it about ; but lett Every 
one take y' is free to take it as they have ocation 
and not more than will doe them Good." 

The next year the Yearly Meeting took up the 
subject and adopted strong resolutions against 
the practice of giving liquor at public vendues, as 
it excited bidders and created an incautious rivalry. 
Thee,xpenditurefor rum was frequently the largest 
item in vendue accounts. At the vendue of Ann 
Marshall, of New Garden, as shown in her ac- 
counts of 1729, there was paid "To John Read 
for Rum at y' Vendue 13s. 4d.," while "ye 
Gierke " received only 4s. and "William Rowan 
Cryer at y* Vendue" only 10 s. 

In 1733, a writer in the Pennsylvania Gazette 
complains that 



Social Life of the Iri^h Friends 225 

" It is now become the practice of some other- 
wise discreet women, instead of a draught of beer 
and toast, or a chunk of bread and cheese or a 
wooden noggin of good porrige and bread, as our 
good old English custom is, or milk and bread 
boiled, or tea and bread and butter or milk or 
milk coffee &c that they must have their two or 
three drams in the morning." 

Here are some cases of intemperance of Irish 
Friends brought before New Garden Monthly 
Meeting : 

10 Mo 12, 1724. — " Whereas Joseph & Nehemiah H being both 

overtaken in Drink in y' County of New Castle & have condemned y" 
Same Under their hands which papers were read heere to y" Satisfaction of 
this Meeting & Appoints Benjamin fired to read y" Same in y' Next first 
dayes Meeting." 

10 Mo 12, 1724. — " Thomas Jackson of Thomas Town in Marlborough 
has appeared at this meeting as desired & has Signified y* it was not y® 
greatness of y* quantity of drink but beeing unwell for Some time before 
which he thinks was y" cause of this Sickness but for y' Clearing of truth 
he is willing to give in a paper, therefore he is desired to bring it y'' next 
Monthly Meeting." 

2. Mo. 10. 1726. — " Dear friends whereas it Accidentally hapened y' 
1 was overtaken In Licquor and I do believe y' my being before unwell & 
weak of body was Some occasion of it & I am Sory for it as witness my 
hand. THOMAS Jackson." 

4 Mo. 24, 1732. — London Grove Preparative Meeting reports "y' 

Joseph P was over taken with Strong Drink at Darby & and he 

being feavored with a deep Sence thereof have given this Meeting a paper " 
of acknowledgment. 

11 Mo. 25, 1734. — New Garden Preparative Meeting reports "y' 

James M Sen' was overcome with Strong Licqor & did Strik & 

abuse his wife." He was disowned, 12 Mo. 22, 1734-5. 

8 Mo. 30, 1736. — Mary B ly has "been Adicted to Drunkenness 

for some years past & has been visited and Admonished against it Divers 
times yett Does not Desist from it." Disowned 9 Mo. 27, 1736.

In harvest time neighborinij families assisted each 
other, the women often workins^ in the fields with 
the men. Says Parke : " The [y] also make great 
Preparations against harvest both Roast & boyled, 
Cakes & Tarts & Rum stand at the Lands End, 
so that they may eat and drink at Pleasure." Fre- 
quently refreshments of cider and rum were too 
much for Friends, and exciting scenes attended 
the harvest. We have an instance of this in 
Warrington Monthly Meeting records of 1748. 
A PViend made the following acknowledgment : 

I was overtaken with the effects of spirituous liquor in the harvest 
field, reaping for John Rankin in Red Land Valley [near Lewisberry, 
York County] last harvest. It was a hot day, I drank more than I should 
have to drive out the sweat to make me in better capacity to follow my 
work, but it produced the contrary effect, so that I was for a time light in 
the head and I talked foolish. 

At New Garden Monthly Meeting, 5 Mo. 29, 
1729, London Grove Preparative Meeting made 
report : 

yt Will'" Lowdon was a fighting with Michacll Harlan Jun ye Last 
Harvest for w^ he is Sorry & has Given a paper Condemning ye Same 
which this meeting Takes as Sattisfaction. 

In 1754, Warrington Monthly Meeting ex- 
pelled Robert W , on complaint of John 

Farmer who said that R. W. came " to his house 
full of drink and did abuse him and his family, and 
when he provoked some of them to strike him he 
took warrants for the whole family, considerably 
to their damage." 



Social Life of tJie Irish Friends 227 

Again, in 1758, John W , of Menallen Disorderly 

Meeting, made the following acknowledgment : 

" Whereas, some lime ago I went to the Burial of one of my Neighbours ; 
from the Grave yard I went a few miles where I heard there was a Gather- 
ing of men, Expecting to see some men I had business with, and notwith- 
standing I have made profession of the blessed truth for many years past, 
thro' unwatchfulness Committed that great Evil of taking more strong 
drink than I ought to have done, the Effect of which brought on another 
Evil, for Rideing home in Company with some of my Neighbours, a differ- 
ence fell out amongst us where I received, as 1 thought at that time, provo- 
cation Enough to do as I did, (but I am far from thinking so now, ) which 
was the putting of my hat and Jacket in order to have satisfaction," etc. 

In 1758, James McG , of Menallen, pro- 
duced an acceptable acknowledgment for being 
overtaken with strong drink ; " the adversary hav- 
ing got the advantage I took the undue liberty of 
singing Idle songs along with a company that was 
Engaged in that Exercise." His paper was read 
on "First-day" at Alenallen Meeting. 

Here are some further cases of disorder in which 
Irish Friends were concerned : 

At New Garden Monthly Meeting, 2 Mo. 26, 1729, Nottingham Pre- 
parative reports " that Roger Keirk son of Alphancius Keirk was a Rassel- 
ing for a weger which he seems to aveade." 4 Mo. 28th, it is reported 
" y' he said he hoped to be more Carefull but did not appear at this meet- 
ing nor is not willing to Condemn it any further." 7 ^^o- 27th, he appeared 
at the meeting but being of " Rather a Cavelling Contentious Spirit than 
otherwise this meeting thinks it of Necessity to disown him." 

u Mo. 31,1729, New Garden was informed that John C — n in Contro- 
versie with Thomas L — ly did through provecation Curse & Swear, and that 
y' s"* L — ly Did use Scurrilous vain & unbecoming Language to John C — n. ' ' 
An acknowledgment from these offenders was accepted, but the privilege 
to sit in business meetings was withdrawn. 2 Mo. 25, 1730, "John C — n 
& Thomas L — ly was a fighting." The former was then disowned, while 
the latter expressing his sorrow was retained in membership. 



2 28 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

Report was made to New Garden Monthly 
Meeting, ii Mo. 28, 1737-8, that certain Friends 
appointed to read a testimony against John St — r, 
of Sadsbury Meeting, for not complying with " y' 
Award of y" friends Chosen by him & his brother " 
in a dispute, 

shewed it to s'' John, and that he & and his father Joyned in running 
out against friends & said y* Testamony was a parsil of lies that they had 
made up amongst themselves and when a friend stood up & began to read 
it at y' breaking up of a first day meeting according to y" Direction of y" 

monthly meeting, Isaac St r [father of John] stood up & bid hira 

Leave of reading it for it is a parsil of lies & sleped to y* friend & Catched 
y° paper & tore it to pieces, whereby y" reading of it was stoped at that 
time." 

Isaac St — r was then dealt with "for his Con- 
tempt of y" Authority of y' meeting " and was re- 
quired to bring in a written acknowledgment of 
his fault. 

Care of One of the duties of the monthly meeting was 
to investigate cases of alleged mistreatment of 
indented servants. At New Garden, 12 Mo. 25, 
1726-7, Sadsbury Preparative Meeting 

made a Complaint against James Musgrave Son of Jn° Musgrave of Sads- 
bury for Strikeing a .Servant man of Caleb Perces [Peirce's] the which he 
Seems to Justifie therefore this meeting appoints Saml' Miller & Caleb 
Perse to Endeavour to bring him to a Sence of his Evill Action. 



Indented 
Servants 



Caseoj One of the most interesting cases concerning 
Lowden indented servants that Friends were called upon 

versus _ ' 

Smith to settle was that of I^owdcn versus Smith, brought 
before New Garden Monthly Meeting. It seems 
that William Lowden, probably after the death of 



Social Life of the Irish Friends 229 

his father, John Lowden, in 17 14, was bound as a 
servant, until the age of twenty-one, to John 
Smith, of Marlborough, son-in-law of Caleb Pusey. 
As young Lowden approached his majority a dif- 
ference arose between him and his master as to 
the date of expiration of the term of service. 
Evidently there were not exact data at hand to de- 
termine the point. Thereupon, 3 Mo. 9, 1724, 
the matter was brought up for the Monthly Meet- 
ing to decide. 

At this meeting, as a first step in the proceed- 
ings, a committee was appointed "to write to y° 
Monthly Meetings of y*" Grange In y'' County of 
Antrim «& to New Garden In y" County of Carlow 
both In Ireland for y" Ages of y' Children of John 
Lowdon." 

At the next Monthly Meeting, held 5 Mo. nth. 

Friends being Informed Alt our Last Monthly Meeting of A Differ- 
ence between John Smith and William Lowden about y' Age of William 
Lowden he being bound to John Smith Until! he come of Age & y' Last 
Meeting .Appointed Thomas Jackson James Lindley Benjamin ffredd Si- 
mon Hadly Joseph Sharp & Michael) Lightfoot to See they could help them 
to Accommodate it, 

And Now these friends gives this Meeting An Account that they Mett 
with them & they could not fully End it, but John & William Mutually 
have Chosen four friends whom they have left it to fully to determine. 

The young man, becoming impatient of the 
delay of tne arbitrators, probably left his master 
before the proper time, for on 9 Mo. 7, 1724, just 
three days before what later proved to be his 
twenty-first birthday, 



230 Iimnigration of the Irish Quakers 

A Concern coming Upon this Meeticg concerning Wm : Lowdens dis-

as he had agreed to do, Therefore we now desire y' Visiters to speak to 
him to bring him to a Sence thereof that he may condemn y" Same & y' 
they give an account to y" Next Monthly Meeting. 

No further mention of the matter is to bef ound 
in the minutes until 7 Mo. 11, 1725, when the de- 
sired evidence from Irish ret^nsters — showing the 
vakie of such records — had arrived : 

" This Meeting has received an account from y"

The records show that during the several wars Military 
in which the Province was involved, not a few •'^'^''*" 
Friends departed from their peace principles and 
enlisted as soldiers. In the period of the French 
and Indian war, we have an instance in the War- 
rington minutes. i Mo. 17, 1756, " Menallen 
Meeting informs this meeting that John Black- 
burn [an Irish Friend, sometime Judge of York 
County] and John Pope, at a report of Indians 
doincj mischief at a OTeat distance from them went 
out in a warlike manner to meet them Contrary to 
our Peaceable principles." For this breach of 
discipline the offenders finally expressed their 



232 Imniigratio7i of the Irish Quakers 

sorrow and were continued in membership. Widi 
the opening of the Revolution, however, Judge 
Blackburn was reported to the Monthly Meeting, 
2 Mo. 10, 1776, as having " inlisted as a soldier" 
and was subsequently disowned. Other members 
of the same family also joined the American ranks. 
6 Mo. 7, 1777, Joseph Blackburn "hath Knlisted 
to be a soldier." 7 Mo. 12, 1777, Thomas Black- 
burn, Jr., and Anthony Blackburn, jr., have "as- 
sociated or joined in the Military Exercises." 

As President Sharpless points out in his valu- 
able monograph,' the Society of Friends in the 
struggle for independence took a neutral position 
and stood firmly by their testimony against war. 
They were "friends of liberty, but opposed to 
war, desirous of maintaining their civil rights, but 
by other means than illegality and revolution, and 
unwilling to afford aid to the British ; divided in 
their sympathies, but largely united in the stand 
that they could take no part in the strife of the 
day. . . . When war and revolution became in- 
evitable . . . they issued a declaration of neu- 
trality.^ They were neither Tories nor revolu- 
tionists." In considering the question of Quaker 
sympathies in the conllict, the author con- 
tinues : " About four hundred, perhaps, actively 
espoused the American side by joining the army, 

' The Quakers in the Revolution. 
^ Ibid., Preface. 



Social Life of the Irish Frietids 233 

accepting positions under tlie revolutionary gov- 
ernment, or taking an affirmation of allegiance to 
it, and lost their birthright among Friends as a 
result. Perhaps a score in a similar way openly 
espoused the British cause, and also were disowned 
by their brethren. These members very likely rep- 
resented proportions of silent sympathizers." ^ 

The Revolutionar}' government of Pennsylvania Revointion- 
was resolved that if the Quakers and other non- '"'-^'^".'^" 

~ and I'lnes 

combatants would not fight they should at least 
pay the expenses of those who did. The Friends 
accordingly were ordered to pay heavy war taxes. 
This, however, they refused to do on the ground 
that they could not consistently contribute to the 
support of war, and those members who obeyed 
were dealt with by the meeting. Thereupon, the 
tax collectors seized the property of Friends to 
the value of the taxes and the fines imposed for 
non-compliance. An example of such exactions, 
covering the period 1 778-1 790, is recorded by 
George McMillan, an Irish Friend, of York 
County, in his manuscript account book, and it is 
of such interest that I venture to print it in full : 

On the 22'"' of i"' mo 1778 btwen one and two oclock in the after- George Mc- 
noon Came henry I^ewis James Perkeson and John Witherow to my hous Millan's

But little data on early schools attended by schools 
Irish Friends have been gleaned, but the evidence ^"^^^ 
indicates that from the earliest days of the Colony 
provision of some sort was made for education in 
nearly all Quaker neighborhoods. In 1725, Parke 
mentions an Irish Quaker pedagogue. " Unkle 
Nicholas Hooper," he writes, "lives very well he 
rents a Plantation & teaches School & his man 
dos his Plantation work." 

Reading matter in the country districts was 
confined chiefly to the Bible and Friends' books.

James Logan 

The Irish Quaker Governor of Pennsylvania 



CHAPTER III. 

SOME PROMINENT IRISH FRIENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA 

THE most eminent of the Irish Friends and James 
one of the most important personages of 
the Province, was James Logan, the faith- 
ful friend and efficient secretary and agent of the 
Proprietor, William Penn. He was born of 
Scotch parentage, 8 Mo. (October) 20, 1674, at 
Lurgan, County Armagh, Ireland.^ His father, 
Patrick Logan, a native of East Lothian, Scot- 
land, whose ancestry has not yet been satisfac- 
torily determined, was graduated from the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh, with the degree of Master 
of Arts,^ and became a clergyman of the Estab- 
lished Church, serving for a time as chaplain to 
Lord Belhaven '■' ; but later he joined the Society 
of Friends and removed with his family to 
Lurgan, where he took charge of a Latin school.

About all that is known of James Logan's early 
life is contained in his aiitobiojrraphy, which, as it 
has never been published — so far as I can learn — 
is here printed in its entirety : 

My Father was bom in E Lotbain in Scotland : was educated for the 
^'^"■SXi ^ ^''^ " Chaplain for some time ; but turning Quaker, he was 
obliged to go to Ireland & to teach a Latin School there — Me had 
several children,' of whom none are now living, nor have been, more than 
tliese 50 years past, saving my B' W'" who took his degree of Doctor of 
Physick in Holland — and is now the chief Physician in Bristol — and my- 
self — My Mother was Isabel Hume D&ugh' of James Hume — a younger 
Brother of the Mouse of St Leonards, of the Shire of Mers (as I think) in 
the South of Scotland. He was Manager of the I-state of the Karl of 
Murray — who owed, but never paid him ^^1500 Stcrl. iho the said Earl 
lodged for some years in his House in the Shire of Fife — My Grandmother, 
before she married, was lielhia Dundas,' Sister of the Laird of Dundas, of 
Didiston, alx>ut 8 miles west of Edinburgh a fine seat, and the Earl of 
Murray assisted my Grandfather in carrying off my Grandmother — She was 
nearly related to the Earl of Panmat [Panmure] &c. 

Having learned Latin, Greek, and some Hebrew, before I was 13 years 
of age — in my 14th I was put Apprentice to a Linncn Draper — one as con- 
siderable with his Partner as any in Dublin. But the Prince of Orange, 
landing before I was twund (tho' I served my Master 6 months) in the 
winter 16.S8, I went down to my Parents — and the wars in Ireland coming 
on. In the Spring I went over to Edinburgh with my Mother — after 
which my Father soon followed, who being out of employment — repair'd 
to London, & was there gladly receiv'd by our friends — Deputies to the 
Geni Meeting from Bristol in that City — as their schoolmaster ' — for the 

' Hannah Ix>gan, daughter of Patrick Logan, of Lurgan, died 7 Mo. 15, 
1678, and was interred in the burial place at Monreanerty. — MS. Lurgan

I^lin language, and I followed him the next year ; but tho' the wages 
were good, and well paid, he could not brook the Mothers taking upon 
them to direct his treatment of their children, and thereupon soon disliking 
it, having ordered my Mother to return to IreP to take care of what they 
had left there. 

In 1693 after above 3 years stay there, pretending to go over for my //,\j Father 
Mother,' but with a real design never to return He left me in his school. Returns to 
not full 19 years of age— ordering me on the receipt of his Letter Signifying Ireland and 
my Mother would not come over, that I should give up the school & re- I^eaves Son 
turn to him. But our Friends would not give me up, I therefore continued *" (-""''S' <U 
in the same employment untill the peace of Reswick in 1697. ' " 

In which time, as I had in Edinburgh in my l6th year, happily met Studies 
with a book of the Leyboms on the Mathematics, I made myself Master Mathematics 
of that, without any manner of Instruction, and in the time in which I kept and the 
school, I further improved myself in the Greek looking a little further into Languages 
the Hebrew — I also learned French & Italian with some Spanish ; but 
went 3 mos. to P>ench Master to learn the Pronunciation, without which I 
was sensible I should never be able to speak it. But otherwise I never 
paid one penny for Learning any thing whatsoever, and tho' I had my 
course of Humanity — as it is called in Ireland from my Father, I can 
safely say, he never gave me the least instruction whatsoever, more than 
he gave to the other scholars — 

good scholar, and an apt schoolmaster to instruct youth in Latin, &c. , is a 
present out of employment, and, upon some discourse of it among Friends 
at London, is in some expectation that he may be serviceable to Friends' 
children at Bristol, upon consideration of which this meeting is desirous 
to promote it, in hopes it may be serviceable to our youth." In 9 Mo. 
following the treasurer was desired to hand Patrick Logan " £%o, and to 
pay Jno. Harwood's note of carpenter's work for the said school." — Wil- 
liam Tanner, Three Lectures on the Early History of the Society of Friends 
in Bristol and Somersetshire, London, 1858, p. 124.

brought To Patt* Loagan Sent him from George Keeth & friends being

Rtfa^es in But to return ; After the Peace, having first agreed in Bristol, to go over 

Shipping, with another Factor to Jamaica, I went over to Ireland to see my Parents ' : 

i6gy and having told them my intention of going over to that Island, my Mother 

was so averse to it, that she affirmed s!ie would much rather see me dead — 
On this I was obliged to change my measures, & began with a cargo, 
from Dublin, to enier on a trade between that place and Bristol, which I 
followed for about 8 months. 
Becomes When in the spring of 1699, our old Proprietor [William Penn] sent for 

Penn's Secre- me, and made me his proposals to come over to Penn' as his Secretary, and 
lary, 1690 desired me to take time & advice upon it — Some of my Friends advised 

me to accept, & some others as strenuously against it ; but in some few 
days I went over to Bath — with my fr'' K* Hackel, & accepted of it. 
Comes to In 8" 1699, being then at Sea, in our voyage hither — I was 25 ys. of 

Pennsylvania age — The Proprietor continued here 2 years wanting about 5 weeks, and 
left me in more offices that I was fit to undertake & got tliro'. But had 
I left his whole business — at the time of his departure, I might — consider- 
ing my singular good fortune — or the kind Providence that has ever at- 
tended me — for which I can never be sufficiently grateful, I might I say 
with great ease have doubled my present fortune — & equaled what the 
Prop" son Tho' charged me with having — according to an information he 
had rec'' viz : — £ 60,000 but I am fully content with what I have tho' not 
half so much — The old Proprietor was willing to give me what I would 
ask, for my ten years service, & considering his melancholy circum- 
stances in 171 1 I set it at £ lOO a year cur"' for all manner of services 
whatsoever, But told him I would stay in his service no more than 2 years 
— liut he was seized with an apoplectic fit in less than I year which tied 
me down to his business, vastly it proved to my loss — as my Letters de- 
signed at first for our Proprietor Thos Penn fully demonstrate — '

second coming, in the Canterbury, in 1699, and 
immediately plunged him into the affairs of the

Colony. Young Logan soon showed such marked 
capacity for business and administration that his 
services became indispensable, and Penn, on his 
departure for England in 1701, not only continued 
him as Secretary of the Province but gave him a 
general charge both of the government and 
property, saying, " I have left thee in an uncom- 
mon trust with a singular dependence on thy 
justice and care."^ 

The Proprietor's confidence was not misplaced ; Governor 0/

Logan ever remained true to his trust, and dis- 
charged his duties with fidelity and judgment. 
His life becoming more and more occupied with 
public affairs, for the next forty years he was 
always holding some high office — Commissioner 
of Property, member of Provincial Council, Judge 
of Common Pleas, Mayor of Philadelphia, Chief 
Justice; and, in 1736-38, as President of the 
Provincial Council, acting as Governor of Penn- 
sylvania.'- 

He became the devoted leader of the Proprie- Leader of

that was waged after Penn's return to England, 
and zealously guarded the Penn interests and 
prerogatives against what were deemed the en-

bly, led by David Lloyd, and of the Church Party, 
led by Colonel Robert Ouarr)-. It is true that in 
these earlier years of his life Logan did at times 
become heated in partisan controversy, to such an 
extent as to make himself unpopular ; but later in 
life he was generally respected for his learning, 
character, and ability. He remained a Friend all 
his life, but differed from the great body of the 
Society in his belief in defensive war. 

Like his friend Penn, Logan knew how to win 
and keep the confidence of the Indians. It was 
largely due to him that friendship and alliance be- 
tween them and the Province was so long main- 
tained. He often had them as guests at Stenton, 
his beautiful county-seat, near Germantown. On 
some occasions, it is said, there were as many as 
three or four hundred, who would remain for days 
enjoying the hospitality of the plantation ^ The 
high regard in which he was held by the Indians 
was expressed by Cannassetego, chief of the Onon- 
dagas, in a speech at the making of a treaty be- 
tween the Six Nations and Governor Thomas and 
the Council, at Philadelphia, in July, 1742 : 

Brethren, we called at our friend James Logan's on our way to this city, 
and to our grief found him hid in the bushes and retired through infirmities 
from public business. We pressed him to leave his retirement, and pre- 
vailed with him to assist once more on our account at your council. He is 
a wise man and a fast friend to the Indians, and we desire when his soul 
goes to God you may choose in his room just such another person of the

same prudence and ability in counseling, and of the same tender disposi- 
tion and affection for the Indians.' 

It is not only as a statesman but also as a man Literary 
of letters and science that James Logan is con- """' ^ 
spicuous in our colonial annals. The fortune 
which he acquired in commerce and in trade with 
the Indians enabled him to spend his later days in 
scholarly retirement at Stenton,- in the enjoyment 
of his library' and in writing. He carried on an 
extensive correspondence with the most learned 
men of Europe and America, and wrote numerous

^ The picturesque and dignified old mausion of Stenton, built by Logan 
in 172S, is one of the most interesting examples of colonial architecture ex- 
tant. Thanks to the loving zeal of the Pennsylvania Society of the Colo- 
nial Dames of America, it has recently been carefully restored, and under 
their trusty guardianship it has been opened to the public. The house, 
still surrounded by ample grounds and reached by a fine avenue of hem- 
locks, is a two story brick structure with two great towering chimneys and 
a heavy roof set with dormer windows. 

Passing up the curious circular stone steps, firmly clamped together 
with iron, one enters the great hall, paved with brick and wainscoted to 
the ceiling. In one corner is an open fireplace, and in the rear the stately 
double staircase. On either hand are lofty rooms, also handsomely 
wainscoted. The large fireplace in the room to the left has in it a back- 
plate of iron inscribed ''J. L. 1728." In another room the fireplace 
still retains some of its original blue and white Dutch tiles, of most gro- 
tesque pattern. One of the most attractive rooms is the library, in which 
the book-loving master of the place spent much of his time. This is a large, 
finely lighted apartment, taking up half of the front of the house in the second 
story. Indeed, the ancient house is full of delights for the antiquary and 
the lover of the olden time. From garret to cellar there are all sorts of 
quaint nooks and comers, mysterious cupboards and closets and secret 
staircases ; and leading from the cellar to the stables is a long under- 
ground passage, the subject of many a strange legend.

works, many of which are still imprinted. His 
letters and writings show that there was almost no 
topic in science or literature that he could not dis- 
cuss with the scholars of his time. " Sometimes 
Hebrew or Arabic characters and algebraic for- 
mulas roughen the pages of his letter-books. 
Sometimes his letters convey a lively Greek ode 
to a learned friend ; and often they are written in 
the Latin tongue."' His friend Linnaeus, in com- 
pliment to his botanical knowledge, named after 
him a natural order of herbs and shrubs, the Lo- 
ganiacerc, containing some thirty genera in three 
hundred and fifty species. He published Latin 
essays on reproduction in plants, and on the aber- 
ration of light ; translated Cato's Disticha and 
Cicero's De Sencchite, and issued many other 
works which are Hsted in Joseph Smith's monu- 
mental Catalogue of Friends Books} His corre- 
spondence with the Penn family, from i 700-1 750, 
which is a mine of historical information, reveals 
his carefulness and intellectual breadth. Says 
Professor Tyler, " Occasionally one finds in it a 
passage of general discussion, in which the clear 
brain and the noble heart of the writer utter them- 
selves in language of real beauty and force."''

He bequeathed to the City of Philadelphia his 
private library of 3,000 volumes, comprising all 
the Latin classics and more than a hundred folios 
in Greek. These books formed the foundation of 
the Loganian Library which later was included in 
the Philadelphia Library Company.^ 

"In personal appearance," says Watson,^ Personal 
"James Logan was tall and well proportioned, 
with a graceful yet grave demeaner. He had a 
good complexion, and was quite florid even in old 
age, nor did his hair, which was brown, turn gray 
in his decline of life, nor his eyes require spec- 
tacles. According to the customs of the times, 
he wore a powdered wig. His whole manner was 
dignified, so as to abash impertinence ; yet he was 
kind and strictly just in all the minor duties of ac- 
quaintance and society." William Black, a Vir- 
ginia gentleman, who visited Logan at Stenton, in 
1744, says of his host, that he " seem'd to have 
some Remains of a handsome . . . Person and 
a Complection beyond his years, for he was turn'd 
off 70."' 

From his correspondence with Penn we learn unsuccessful 
of Logan's early disappointment in love. It '^°'"''^'"f' 
seems that he had formed an attachment for Ann 
Shippen, daughter of Edward Shippen, the first

Mayor of Philadelphia, but the fair Ann was in- 
clined to listen to the vows of another suitor, 
Thomas Story, the eminent minister. The prog- 
ress of the love affair soon became the town-talk, 
and even reached the cars of Penn in pjigland.' 
"I am anxiously grieved for thy unhappy love," 
writes Penn to Losjan, under date, 11 IMo. 16, 
I 704-5, " for thy sake and my own, for T. S. and 
thy discord has been of no service here, any more 
than there ; and some say that come thence that 
thy amours have so altered or influenced thee 
that thou art grown touchy and apt to give rough 
and short answers, which many call haughty, &c. 
I make no judgment, but caution thee, as in 
former letters to let truth preside and bear imper- 
tinencies as patiently as thou canst."- To this 
Logan replied, 12 Mo. 11, 1704-5, "I cannot un- 
derstand that paragraph in tliy letter relating to 
T. S. and myself; thou says our discord has done 
no more oood there than here, and know not who 
carried the account of it for I wrote to none that I 
know but thyself in yber, 1 703. . . . Before that 
we had lived eighteen months very good friends, 
without any manner of provocation, only that I 
had about three or four months before spoke 
something to Edward Shippen. . . ."^

In the following year Ann Shippen and Thomas 
Stor)' were married, and Logan seems to have 
become reconciled to the match. He wrote to 
William Penn, Jr., August 12, 1706. "Thomas 
Story carries very well since his marriage. He 
and I are very great friends, for I think the whole 
business is not now worth a quarrel."^ In the 
course of time he recovered from his disappoint- 
ment, and on the 9th of 10 Mo., 1714, was happily Marriage 
married to Sarah Read, daughter of Charles 
Read, a wealthy merchant of the City, sometime 
Mayor and Provincial Councilor.-' 

James Logan died 10 Mo. 31, 1751, in his ^"^"' 
seventy-seventh year, and was interred in Friends' 
burial ground at Fourth and Arch Streets, Phila- 
delphia. Of his children, Sarah married, in 1739, 
Isaac Xorris ; William Logan, who married Han- 
nah Emlen,* serv^ed as Provincial Councilor, 1 747- 
1776^; and Hannah married John Smith,^ of the 
scholarly Smiths of Burlington, New Jersey, an- 
cestor of John Jay Smith, for many years at the 
head of the Philadelphia Library Company.'

I)her, Oliver Hough, 
thinks there is little doubt that his birthplace is in 
England, possibly in Yorkshire. He is styled 
" gentleman," and evidently came of good family, 
probably from a younger branch of the family of 
Holme of Huntington, in Yorkshire, as he used 
an armorial seal on his official papers, correspond- 
ing with the arms - of this family. 
In Ireland Thomas Holme was residine in Limerick, Ire- 
land, in 1655, for it is stated in A CoMrKNDious 
VIEW Of Some Plxtraordinary SUFFERINGS Of 
the . . . QUAKERS . . . In . . . Ireland, etc.,^ 
that in 1655, James Sicklemore, one of the early

' For helpful suggestions and ni.iny of the facts used in this sketch of

*The arms are described in ISurke's General Armory t^s: ".Vrgent, a 
chrevon azure, between three chaplets gules." Mr. Hough says that the 
shield on Thomas Holme's seal is the same, surrounded by a bordure with 
ten roundels, the bordure being used to distinguish the branch of the 
family.

the City by Order of Colonel Ingoldsby."^ 

In 1657, Thomas Holme and others, "being 
peaceably in their F"riends House in Cashel, and 
their Horses at an Inn, as travelling Men, were 
apprehended by a Guard of Soldiers, in the Year 
1657, by Order of Colonel Richard Le Hunt, and 
being brought before him and examined, were vio- 
lently (by Soldiers) turned out of the Town, and 
the Gates kept against them though it was near 
Night, and a dangerous Time for Englishmen to 
lie out of Garrison, because of the Tories or Rob- 
bers, and thereby exposed to the Hazard of their

In 1659, he and fifty-two others published an ad- 
dress to Parliament recitino- " the Cruel and Un- 

O 

just Sufferings of the People of God in the Na- 
tion of Ireland Called Quakers." This pamphlet^ 
relates that " Thomas Holme (late a Captain in the 
Army) . . . and several of the Lords people, be- 
ing in a peaceable meeting at Wexford had their 
meeting forcibly broken and many of them vio- 
lently haled and turned out of the Town, by order 
from Edward Withers Mayor then." It may rea- 
sonably be presumed from this account that 
Thomas Holme came into Ireland as a member of

the New Model, and in the Cromwellian Settle- 
ment doubtless received his allotment (if land 
alontj with his fellow officers. 

He became one of the earliest converts to 
Quakerism in the Island, and about the time of 
the issue of the address of 1659 was livino- in 
Limerick, for it is stated that a guard of soldiers 
from Colonel Ing-oldesby, Governor of the town, 
" rifled the houses of Richard Piercy and Thomas 
Holme, and took awaj- what books and papers 
they pleased." At a later date he was residing 
in Waterford, but probably held propert}' in Wex- 
ford. He seems to have travelled extensively 
over the central and southern parts of the countiy, 
attending meetings of the Society. At Cashell, as 
related in the j)amphlet, he, Thomas Loe, and 
others, being " on their Journey " were brought 
before the officer in charge of the town, who com- 
manded his soldiers "(violently) to turne them out 
of the town and to cut their pates ; three of them 
were not suffered to go into the town again for 
their horses." 

In 1660,^ and also in 1661,'- Thomas Holme 
and other Friends were taken from meetings in 
Dublin and committed to Newgate prison by order 
of the Mayor of the City. In 1672, he and Abra-

whole work of laying- out the land of the settlers 
and locating towns and highways was under his 
super\'ision. With the rapid growth of the coun- 
tr)' the responsibilities of the office increased, so 
that it became one of the most important positions 
in the Province. Holme held this post the re- 
mainder of his life and discharged his duties with 
faithfulness and ability. 

He was also appointed to many other places of 
trust and honor. In 1682, he served as a mem- 
ber of the first Assembly of the Province, which 
began its session at Upland, December 4th, Penn 
presiding. In 1683, he was elected a representa- 
tive from Philadelphia County to the Provincial M^^^bero/ 

i ^ the Provin- 

Council for a term of three years, and took a dai councu 
prominent part in its transactions, serving- on sev- 
eral important committees. In i Mo., 1683, he 
was a member of the joint committee of the Coun- 
cil and Assembly that drew up the new Charter, 
or Frame of Government. Later in the year he 
was one of the commissioners appointed to treat 
with the Governor and Council of West Jersey in 
regard to certain differences between the two col- 
onies. In the following year he and two others 
were on a committee to investigate the actions of 
Lord Baltimore in connection with the bound- 
ary dispute. In the same year, 1684, he was 
one of three appointed to draw up a charter for 
the incorporation of Philadelphia as a borough, 
with a Mayor and six Alderman.

Places of 
Residence 



About the middle of Holme's term (6 Mo. i8, 
1684), Penn authorized the Council to act in his 
place as Governor. Thoma.s Lloyd, as President 
of the Council, now became acting Governor, but 
in 1685 he was absent a large part of the time, 
and Holme was elected to act in hi.s place, presid- 
ing- at twenty-seven out of the fifty meetings held 
this year and also at a number of meetings the 
next year ; so that during Lloyd's absence Thomas 
Holme acted as Governor of the Province. 

After Philadelphia was laid out in 1682, Holme 
removed his family to a house he had built on his 
lot ' at the northwest corner of Front and what 
is now Arch Street, and lived there until 16S8. 
Then he took up his residence at his plantation 
of "Well-Spring," in Dublin Township, Philadel- 
phia County, and, e.xcepting for several extended 
visits to England, continued there for the rest of 
his life, which terminated in March or April, 1695.- 



' It was on a part of this lot farther up Front Street, sold by Holme to 
the Trustees of the Meeting, that the Bank Meeting House was erected in 
1685. 

« The name of Thomas Holme's wife is not known. Oliver Hough says 
she probably died before 1682, as she did not come to Pennsylvania with 
her husband. Their children were : Sarah Holme, who married Richard 
Holcombe, but is not known to have come to Pennsylvania; Michael (?) 
Holme, who died without issue before his father ; Tryell Holme, who also 
died without issue before his father ; Eleanor Holme, married (l) Joseph 
Moss, and (2) Joseph Smallwood, by the latter having one daughter, Sarah 
Smallwood ; Esther Holme, married, in 1683, Silas Crispin, son of Captain 
William Crispin, formerly of the English navy, and died April 17, 1696, 
leaving six children. — See Hough in l^enna. Mag., XX., 251-256.

258 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

Ireland, called Quakers," printed in London, in 
1659, is this entry concerning Robert Turner: 

Kob. Turner, for speaking a few words in the Steeple house at Battdon, 
(after the Priest had done) had his Hat taken away, and was beaten : 
And for speaking a few words in the Steeple-house at Dublin, was very 
much abused, and had his coat taken from him in the said place, and not 
restored to him again : And for asking a Question of a Priest in Dublin, 
was sent to Hridewell, and after kept three months in prison, was put into 
a Cell or Dungeon, a very noisome place, graves being over his head, and 
under his feet : And being in a meeting at London- Derry, was violently 
haled thereout, and drawn along the street by the Arms and Legs, (the 
Mayor of that City then present, and helped with his own hands) and put 
him out of the said town ; and two dayes after hailed him as before, and 
one with a Knif in his hand, threatened to cut off his Members, and turned 
him out again, and tyed him back and legs on a Horses bare back, with a 
haire rope, and led him about as their sport, at their pleasure. 

In 1660 and also in 1661, for attending Quaker 
meetings in Dublin, Robert Turner was committed 
to Newgate ; and in 1662 for the same offense was 
sent to Bridewell.^ 

In William Stockdale's rare little book- there is 
an interesting recital of Turner's sufferings, in 
Dublin, in 1672, as follows: 

" Robert Turner of Brides Alley having his Shop open on the day called 
Thomas day, the Mayor came and took Samuel Randall his Servant, sent him 
to Goal, and the same day released him : and for the like cause on Christmas 
day (called) the Mayor come with a Guard of Souldiers and abused the 
said Robert, sent him to Newgate, where he was detained five days : also 
the rude multitude did beset his House with stones and staves, and throw- 
ing, broke down the Windows, to tlie hurting of some, endangering the 
Lives of others, one stone weighing nine pounds, and said they had 
Orders from the said Mayor : also on the day called Newyears day, for the 
said cause, the said Mayor committed the said Robert and Samuel Randall 

^ Bene IL, 466, 471. 

'^ A Great Cry of Oppression, 212. 



Some Prominent Irish Friends 259 

to Newgate, but released them next day : and on the day called Twelfth 
day the said Mayor for the like cause committed Robert Fuller Servant to 
the said Robert to Prison, and released him the same day : besides other 
wrongs the said Robert by breaking his Windows w'as damnified fourteen 
shillings six pence." 

In 1675, he had taken "by the Wardens, for Priest Gowburns Wages, 
out of the Shop-box three shillings." ' 

He seems first to have become interested in 
colonization in 1677, when he and other Irish 
Friends acquired one whole share of West Jersey, 
their land being laid out on Newton Creek, near 
the site of Camden, in 1681, and settled by Irish 
Friends.- In 1681, he joined with the Earl of 
Perth, William Penn, Robert Barclay, the Apolo- 
gist, and other eminent personages, in the pur- 
chase of East Jersey from the estate of Sir 
George Carteret.^ About the same time his 
friend Penn received the grant of Pennsyl- 
vania, and Turner became actively concerned 
in that project, purchasing 5,000 acres of 
land in the Province'* and subscribing ^500 of 
stock in the Free Society of Traders."" It is evi- 
dent from a letter of James Claypoole that before 
II Mo. 9, 1682, Turner had a prospect of going 
to Pennsylvania, '^ but he did not take his departure 
until a few months later, probably in 5 Mo. 1683,

As previously stated ^ he arrived at Philadelphia, 
8 Mo. 14, 1683, in the Lion of Liverpoole, bring- 
ing- with him his daughter Martha and seventeen 
redemptioners. Here he took up his residence 
and continued his mercantile business. In the 
summer of 1684, he erected the first brick house ^ 
in the city, using brick, as he writes to Penn, 
"after a good manner to encourage others . . . 
and now (6 Mo. 3, 1685) many brave brick houses 
are going up."^ 

Almost from the day of his arrival until his 
death in 1 700, Turner was closely identified with 
public affairs.'* At the Province Council, 8 Mo. 
26, 1683, he was impaneled as a juryman.'^ In the 
following year he became Justice of the Peace and 
Judge of the Court of Common Pleas ;'' he also 
served as Register of Wills and fudge of Quarter 
Sessions and Orphans' Court.' In 1686, he 
was appointed Deputy Surveyor of Philadelphia

1688, he was one of the five Commissioners from

her father. 

Thomas Tliomas Grifhtts, son of George- and Frances 
Griffitts Qi-iffitts, of Cork, was another of the Irish Friends 
to serve as Provincial Councillor and to hold 
other important positions. The Friends of Cork 
signed him a certificate of removal, 8 Mo. i6, 
1 716, stating that he was clear "in respect to 
marriao;e." At that date he was residingf on the 
Bay of Donna Maria in Jamaica, but was about to 
remove to Pennsylvania.

gave him a certificate, 1 1 Mo. 21, 1 7 1 6, and his 
parents wrote from Cork to Isaac Norris and 
Jonathan Dickinson, of Philadelphia, desiring 
them to assist him "in that weighty affair." He 
then settled in Philadelphia, became a merchant, 
and in 1 7 1 7 married Mar)', daughter of Isaac

About 1 716, Robert Strettell went to London 
and engaged in trade, but losing a large amount 
of money in the South Sea Bubble, he decided to 
remove to Pennsylvania. A certificate of removal, 
dated 1 1 Mo. 26, 1 736, for himself and family, from 
Friends' Meeting at Horslydowne, Southvi^ark, was 
received by Philadelphia Monthly Meeting, 4 Mo. 
24, 1737. He made his residence in Philadel- 
phia and opened a shop; in a newspaper of 1738 
is this advertisement: "late imported and to be 
sold by Robert Strettell at his store in Water 
Street facing Fishbourne's Wharf," muslin, cam- 
brics, "flowered damask," India velvet, blue and 
white China plates, Japanese tea kettles, Scotch 
snuff "fine London Pigtail tobacco," etc. His 
business prospered, and by 1 744, when William 
Black visited the city, he had attained such 
affluence that he was able to keep up a country 
house at Germantown. Black writes in his Jour- 
nal^-^ June i, 1744: 

Mr. Strettell carried us to Germantown about a mile further where he 
had a little County House to which he used to come and spend some part 
of the Summer Months, his Wife was then there : . . . We staid till near 
Sun-down at Mr. Strettell's Villa, where we were very kindly Received by 
Mrs. Strettell, she appeared to be a very Agreeable Woman, and Consider-

ing she was in j'ears was Admirably well Shap'd : Mr. Strettell had not 
been long in Philadelphia ; be came over from London with a Cargoe of 
Goods about 9 years Since, and had very Good Success in Trade ; he was 
one of the Friends . . . he, I really do believe, appear'd what he really 
was, a very Honest Dealer, and Sincere in everything he Acted ; he was a 
very Modest Man in Company, Spoke little, but what he said was always 
worth the Noticing, as he gave everything Consideration before he Deliver' d 
it ; he was . . . very Moderate in Drinking and kept Good horses . . . 
he had only one son [Amos] who Liv'd with him, about 19, and was in 
Partnership with him in Trade, he appear'd to be a very Promising Sober 
and well Inclin'd young Man, and much attach'd to Business, even uncom- 
mon for his years. 

Strettell began his public career in 1741. In 
that year he was elected a member of the Com- 
mon Council of the City and also appointed to the 
Provincial Council. In 174S, he was elected 
Alderman, and in 1751, Mayor of Philadelphia. 
He was a Friend, but like James Logan, was a 
believer in defensive war.' 

He was married, 5 Mo. 18, 17 16, at Reigate, 
Surrey, to Philotesia Owen.^ He died in June, 
1761, and in his will mentions his " Proprie- 

' In 1741, he was apiwinted on a committee to determine whether or not 
a letter on defensive war, written by James Logan to the Yearly Meeting, 
should be read before that body. Strettell was in favor of having the 
letter read, but the other members of the committee overruled and a nega- 
tive report was made to the Meeting. Thereupon, Strettell arose in his 
seat and began to express himself as .idverse to the decision, but one of the 
committee caught him by the coat, saying sharply, " Sit thee down, Robert, 
thou art single in that opinion." — Letter of Richard Peters to John Pcnn, 
October 20, 1741. (Paina. Mag., VL, 403.) 

'Philotesia Owen was bom at Coulsdon, England, 5 Mo. 17, 1697, and 
died June 28, 1782. She was the daughter of Nathaniel Owen (died II

Surrey, and subsequently of Reigate, in the same county, by Francis Ridge

moval to America, but came to Philadelphia about 
1745, where he died 2 Mo. 28, 1747." 

William Stockdale, Provincial Councillor of wiiuam 
Pennsylvania, and minister of the Society of 
Friends, first appears in the annals of Friends in 
1657, as of Lanarkshire, Scotland. On Februar)' 
26th of that year he wrote a short statement of 
some of the sufferings of Friends in Scotland, 
which is given in the second^ edition of a Quaker 
pamphlet called, "The Doctrines and Prin- 
ciples: the Persecutions, Imprisonment, Banish- 

' John Strettell remained in England and was brought up to business by 
his uncle, John Owen. He became an opulent merchant in Lime Street, 
London, for some time residing at Croyden in Surrey. He died in 1786, 
leaving an estate of over ;{j45,ooo.

the Priests and Magistrates of Scotland, contrary' 
to the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles,"' 
issued by him^ and several others in 1659. 

In this little work is the following account of 

o 

Stockdale's persecutions : 

William Stockdale, and John Boweram, being moved of the Lord to 
go to Strahaven [Slralhaven] in Evandale [Avondale, I^narkshire], and 
declaring the word of truth there one a Market-day to the people, was 
oftentimes knockt down with stones, and stoned out of the town with vio- 
lence by the wicked people (p. 3). 

William Stockdale, was knockt down in the Steeple-house yard of 
Damanoy, and the people set their feet upon him, and pulled much hair 
off his head ; insomuch that some of them cried he is kild, for he could 
not speak nor rise off the ground for along time (p. 4). 

William Stockdall, was put in prison four days in a hole where he 
could scarce get room to lye down for speaking to James Nesmith, Priest 
of Hambleton (p. 6). 3 

In 1670, we find William Stockdale living in 
County Tyrone, Ireland, probably in the Parish 
of Benburb, for in this year he had a "pair of Pot- 
hooks" valued at 5 d. seized for refusing to contrib- 
ute 2 d. towards the repairs of the "Seats and Glass 
windows of Benburb Parish Worship house." ' He 
was a member of Grange Meeting near Charle- 
mont, and with the exception of two years spent

as one of the authors of the first edition.

in missionary effort at Londonderry/ he seems 
to have resided in that neighborhood until his re- 
moval to Pennsylvania. John Whiting in his 
Memoirs, published in 1715, says that he "trav- 
elled much in the Service of Truth in England 
and Scotland and was very serviceable ; especially 
in Scotland as aforesaid, and also in Ireland, where 
he dwelt." - 

In 1683, he published a book entitled, "The 
Great Cry of Oppression : or A Brief Relation of 
some part of the Sufferings of the People of God, 
in scorn called Quakers in Ireland, for these 1 1 
years — for Tithes, &c. — with a Testimony against 
taking and paying Tythes."^ 

He sailed from Ireland for Pennsylvania with 
his family, probably in the ship Friendship, of Liv- 
erpool, in 1684-5,' ^s he witnessed a will made 
on board that vessel, January (11 Mo.) 16, 1684 

' Says y^K/O' (footnote, 343), "about the year 1673, William Stockdale 
a Friend of the ministry, and Thomas Francis another Friend, removed 
their Dwelling from Charlemont to Londonderry and kept a meeting there 
for two years," but met with so little success in their missionary work that 
they returned to their former abode.

John Whiting, etc. (London, 1715), 231-2. 

•■"He states that in 16S0 he had seven " carloads of Hey" taken for 
tithes (p. 150). In 1682, " William Stockdale, after his Tryal at the As- 
sizes in Londonderry, for being at a Religious Meeting, to worship God, 
in the County of Tyrone, was closely imprisoned for ten Months, upon Pre- 
tence of Fees, by Procurement of John Rooke, Clerk to Richard Reeves, 
who was then Judge there." — A Cornp'-ndioits View (Dublin, 1731), 5^-

lived for a number of years in the northeast part 
of New Castle County, of which he was chosen a 
Justice of the Peace in 1685 (July 29), 1689, and 
1690.- He was a member of Newark Meeting, 
the Newark Monthly Meeting registers recording 
the deaths of his daughter Ruth, 6 Mo. 30, 1687, 
and his wife Jane, 7 Mo. 8, 1688. In 1689, he was 
again married, under the care of the Monthly 
Meeting, to Hannah Druett. 

On 2 Mo. I, 1689, he was admitted to the Pro- 
vincial Council as a representative from New 
Castle County,^ and took an active part in its 
deliberations. His name does not appear in the 
minutes after 7 Mo., 1690. In the doctrinal con- 
troversy between George Keith and the Friends 
he was an ardent defender of the principles of the 
Society. 

At Philadelphia Monthly Meeting, 3 Mo. 26, 
1692, he "appeared before the meeting and Sig- 
nified his mind to leave this Province and desired 
a Certificate," but 8 Mo. 28th, "his inclination 
for removal of his family at present is ceased." 
He had now become much reduced in circum- 
stances, so that at the above meeting a commit- 
tee was directed "to look into his necessity and

County in the Provincial Council from 1685 to

to his emigration within the limits of Mountmel- 
lick Meeting, Queen's County, Ireland. F"rom 
Stockdale's^ account of his sufferings for tithes, 
and from other sources, it is evident that he was 
a prosperous farmer with large flocks and herds 
and several servants. 

In 1680, there were taken from him for tithes, 
seventeen "truckle-loads of Hey, and nineteen 
sheaves of Beans, and thirty-three sheaves of small 
Barly, all worth one pound one shilling" ;'' seven-

With the hope of ending these persecutions he 
made ready to remove with his family to Pennsyl-

as we have seen on page 58, that he had "walked 
honestly," but that Friends were " generally dis- 
satisfied with his so removing, he beine so well 
settled with his family, and having sufficient sub- 
stance for food and raiment . . . ; but our Godly 
jealousy is that his chief ground [for removal] is 
fearfulness of sufferings here." He sailed the

tract of land in Concord, now Delaware County.

the Provincial Assembly from Chester County, 
and was re-elected several times. In 1700, he 
was one of the committee to consider and draw 
up a new Frame of Government and to revise the

warnincT of the intended attack of the British on 
his army at White Marsh, in 1777, was an Irish 
Quaker. She was born about 1729, the daughter 
of John Barrington, a Friend, of DubHn, and was 
married 11 Mo. 2, 1753, at Friends' Meeting, in 
Sycamore Alley, Dublin, to William Darragh (born 
about 1 7 19) of the same city. They came to 
Philadelphia about i 765 and lived, it is thought, 
on Second Street, below Spruce. 

William Darragh died 6 Mo. 8, 1783, and his 
widow, on April 22, 1786, purchased a house on 
the west side of Second Street, between Market 
and Chestnut Streets, where she resided and kept 
a shop. She died 12 Mo. 28, 1789, and, although 
she had been disowned from the Society for neg- 
lecting to attend meetings, she was buried in 
Friends' burial ground at Fourth and Arch Streets. 
The inventory of her estate amounted to ^1628 
1 7 s. 9 d. In her will she mentions her son Charles 
Darragh, who served in the American Army, as 
"Ensign in Second Penna Feby 1777 and ist 
Lieut retired i July 1778."' I'or this breach of 
discipline he was disowned by Philadelphia Monthly 
Meeting, in 1781.^ 

We have now noticed a group of Irish Quakers 
who were most conspicuous and influential in the 
governmental affairs of Pennsylvania during the

Quaker regime, 1682-1756. Many others of 
prominence have been referred to in the chapter 
on " Places of Settlement," and still others receive 
attention in the Appendix. 

While outnumbered by the English and Welsh contribution 
Quakers, these Irish Quakers compare favorably Quakers 
in the performance of public services ; for they 
gave to the Province eight Provincial Councillors, 
three acting Governors, one Proprietar}^ Secre- 
tar}f, two Receivers-General, one Register- 
General, one Surveyor-General, one Provincial 
Treasurer, one Chief Justice, three Judges, one 
Master of Chancery, two Keepers of the Seal, 
twenty-two Justices of the Peace, eighteen As- 
semblymen, two Sheriffs, one County Treasurer 
and three Maj'ors of Philadelphia.^ Serving in 
these important capacities in a province, which, it 
is significant to remember, was founded and con- 
trolled by Quakers down to 1756, and which has 
ever been of foremost rank in the union of States, 
the Irish Quakers have had a strong formative 
influence upon our State and national institutions, 
and thus have been important factors in stamping 
upon these institutions imperishably the doctrines 
of civil and religious liberty. 

Nor did the Irish Quakers play a less important 
part in the social order. Here also they were a 
distinct element of strength. Like most of the

Quaker settlers they were plain yeomen and 
tradesmen, springing from that great middle class 
of society which has ever been the stay and 
strength of Britain, not only upon the field of 
battle but also in the pursuits of peace. They 
had escaped from a land of contest, imprison- 
ment, disaster, and suffering, and found within 
the Quaker commonwealth religious freedom and 
economic opportunity. Their thrift and energy 
made them a substantial and stable part of the 
population ; and their principles as exemplified in 
their lives have entered into the bone and sinew 
of our Republic.

honest Woman, whose House [near Killmore, County Armagh]

he married, 3 Mo. 25, 1710, and about 1715 settled on a tract of 
land in Nottingham, Chester County, which had belonged to his 
father. There he built a smithy and made brass cow bells, then

28o Immigration of tlie Irish Quakers 

In 1676, in County Meath, one William Chanley, of Killncross, 
Parish of Trim, had his goods seized for tithes. — S/ock<iah\ 68. 

Christopher Pennock was married prior to 1675 to Mary, 
daughter of George Collett, of Clonmell, County Tipperary, Ire- 
land. After residing there and in Cornwall, England, for some 
time, he emigrated to Philadelphia about 1685, and died in that 
city in 1701. A son, Joseph, born at Killhouse, near Clonmell, 
Ireland, 11 Mo. 18, 1677, was a merchant in Philadelphia until 
about 1714, when he removed to West Marlborough Twp., Chester 
Co., and settled on a large tract of land, of which he became pro- 
prietor by virtue of a grant from William Penn to George Collett, 
his grandfather. In 1738 he erected a large mansion, "Primitive 
Hall," in which he died, 3 Mo. 27, 1771. (See pages 144-6.) 
By his wife, Mary Levis, he had twelve children, an account of 
whom may be seen in Hiitory 0/ Chester County, p. 680. 

According to Hesse's Siifferini^s of the Quakers, in 1660 (II., 
467), 1666 (II., 475) Christopher Pennock, of Cork, Ireland, was 
imprisoned for attendance at Friends' meetings, and in 1670, for 
the same reason, he had 49 yards of "stuff" worth £1, 9s., 
taken from him (II., 478). In William Stockdalc's Sufferings 
(p. 12), printed in 1683, he is mentioned as having 6s. taken from 
him for maintenance of a "Priest." In 1675, in Cork the 
"Priest" took seven shillings out of his "shop-box." 
— Stockdale, 60. In Cork, in 1676, Mary Pennock for keepmg 
shop open on Christmas day was imprisoned for one night. —

the writer saw the original MS. of Dr. John Kutty's Rise and 
Prof^ress of the (Juaiers in /re/and (in possession of John Pim, 
J.P. , a Friend, of Honaven, Antrim Road. Belfast), bound in a piece 
of old parchment, which on a hasty inspection seemed to be a 
seventeenth century deed, containing the names of Christopher 
Pennock and George Collett, both of Cork. In 1680, George 
Collett, of Clonmell, had seized for tithes six " Pewler Dishes and 
a Pewter Candlestick," valued at ^{^r. — Stockdalt. 165. 

The following extract from a IcUer, dated 2 Mo. 7, 1685, ad- 
dressed to Christopher Pennock, doubtless refers to George Collett : 
" Dear Brother Pennock. Myne and my wife's afTectionate love is 
to thee, and we arc heartily glad it is in thy wife's hart to be 
with thee, and that the way is made for her ffather's condescen- 
sion and willingness thereto." ^Pennock Papers, belonging to 
Mrs. William II. Miller, of Media, Pa.) 

John McComd, from Ireland, was at Philadelphia, in 1688.

NEWARK OR KENNETT MONTHLY MEETING 

Of Chester County, Pa., and New Castle County, Delaware. 
Established in 16S6. 

Valentine Hollingsworth, wife Ann, and children came 
over to Pennsylvania in 1682, from Balleniskcrannell, Parish 
of Sego, County Armagh, Ireland, and settled in New 
Castle County on Delaware. 



3 1 2 Immigration of the Irish Quakers 

Henry Hollingsworth, son of Valentine, came over from 
Ireland in 1683, in the Ship Lion, as an indented servant 
to Robert Turner. — Fenn' a Mag. VIII., 334. 

Valentixr Hollingsworth,' son of Henry Hollingsworth, of 
Belleniskcrannell. Parish of Segoe, County Armagh, Ireland, and 
Catharine, his wife, was born at Belleniskcrannel, ' ' about the sixth 
month in the yeare 1632"; was married 4 Mo. 7, 1655, to Ann 
Ree, daughter of Nicholas Ree,^ of Tanderagee, County Armagh. 
She was born about 1628, at Tanderagee, and died 2 Mo. i, 1671. 
He then was married a second time, 4 Mo. 12, 1 672, to Ann Cal- 
vert, daughter of Thomas Calvert, of Dromgora, Parish of Segoe, 
County Armagh, and Jane his wife. The following is a copy 
of the marriage certificate : 

" ttbiS is to CCrtifle the truth to all people that \'alentine Hollen- 
worth^ in y' psh of Sego in y' county of Armagh, and Anne Cal- 
vert of the same psh having intentions of marriage according to 
the ordinance of God, and Gods joining, Did lay it before mens 
meeting before whom theire marriage being propounded, then y 
meeting desired them to wait some time, w'^" they did, so the 
meeting makeing inquiry between the times whether y'' man be 
free from all other women, and the woman free from all other men, 
and so the second time they comeing before the mens meeting, 
all things being found clear, so they being left to theire freedome. 
A meeting of the people of god being appointed and assembled 
together at the house of Marke Wright, in the psh of Shankell the 
twelfth day of the fourth month in y' yeare 1672 whene they tooke 
one another in marriage in the presence of god and of his people 

' The records of this family in Ireland are from the registers of I.urgan 
Meeting, County Armagh. There is, of course, no foundation for the tra- 
dition that Valentine Hollingsworth married Catharine, daughter of Henry 
Cornish, High Sheriff of London, who was executed in 1685. It is prob- 
able that the Hollingsworths went over from England to Ireland with other 
planters early in the seventeenth century, but there is no proof to show 
that they came from Cheshire, as stated by some historians of the family.

William Stockdale' gives the following account of Hollings- 
worth's persecutions for tithes : 

167 1, County Armagh, "Valentine HoUingsworth had taken 
from him for Tithe, by Thomas Ashbrook Tithmonger twenty 
nine stooks of Barly, and three stocks and a half of Oats, all 
worth one pound one shilling ;'' 1672, "Valentine Hollingsworth 
for Tithe by Edw^ard O'Maghan, 26 stooks wheat. 3 car-loads 
Hey, 26 stooks of Oats, 26 stooks of Barley, Value £z, i8s ;" 
1673, corn and hay, valued at £2 ; 1674, wheat, hay, oats, barley, 
valued at ^3 4s. 

In 1682, Valentine Hollingsworth and his family, accompanied 
by his son-in-law, Thomas Connaway, and by John Musgrave, 
an indented servant, sailed from Belfast for the Delaware,'^ and, 
as we have already stated, ^ settled on a large plantation of nearly 
a thousand acres on Shelpot Creek in Brandywine Hundred, Xew 
Castle County, about five miles northeast of the present city of 
Wilmington. He was prominently identified with the affairs of 
Friends, the early meetings being held at his house. In 1687, he 
gave "unto ffriends for a burying place half an Acre of land for 
y' purpose." A meeting-house was afterward built on this plot 
and the meeting known as Newark, from the name of the planta- 
tion, which in the original survey was called "New Worke." 
Valentine Hollingsworth was appointed a Justice of the Peace for 
New Castle County, in 1685, and represented the county in the 
Assembly in 1682-3, 1687, 1688, 16S9, 1695, and 1700.* He died 
subsequent to 1710, and his wife Ann died 8 Mo. 17, 1697. They 
were interred in Friends' ground at Newark.

Thomas Calvert,' son of John Calvert,' "of Moore Some' 
(neere Gisbrough)," Yorkshire, and wife Grace, was born in 161 7 

' Rc^iten Lurgan Mtttittg, County Armagh. 

'It is possible that John Calvert was of the same kin as the Calverts, 
Lords Baltimore and Proprietors of Mar)'land ; for he came into Ireland 
prior to 1617, from Moorsham, Yorkshire, only about twenty-five miles 
from Kilpin, in the same county, where about 15S0 was born George Cal- 
vert, the first Lord Baltimore (son of Leonard Calvert, a well-to-do country 
gentlemen, by Alice Crosland, his wife, and grandson of John Calvert). — 
See " George Calvert " in Dictionary of National Biography and pp. 1-4, 
George and Cecilius Cahert ("Makers of America" Series, by William 
Hand Browne, N. Y., 1S90). 

In the latter part of the seventeenth century there was a presumption that 
such a relationship existed; for on June 4, 1735, Samuel Hollingsworth, 
of Chester County, made a deposition before the Mayor of Philadelphia, in 
connection with the boundary dispute between the Penns and Ixird Balti- 
more, that in 1683 one Colonel Talbot and a party of I^rd Baltimore's 
surveyors were the guests one night at the home of his father, Valentine 
Hollingsworth, in New Caslle County ; and that in the course of conversa- 
tion during the evening "the said Talbot enquiring into the Place from 
whence this affirmat's fifalher and Mother came and the m.iiden name of his 
mother, which was Calvert, the said CoUonel Talbot invited this affirm- 
ant's ffather to come down and live in Maryland, assuring him his Lord- 
ship would be very kind to him on account of his wife's having been a 
Calvert." — McFarlan-Slem Genealogy, 58. Mary Calvert and William 
Whitesite, were married 3 Mo. 27, 1696, by Friends' ceremony at the 
house of Thomas Calvert near Carrickfergus.

at Lygasory, near Lurgan, County Armagh, and about 9 Mo. 11,

Margaret, of " Stranmillis (nere Belfast)," County Antrim. At 
Ulster Province .Meeting, 4 Mo. 7, 1680, £\. 13. gd. was paid

County Antrim, had some hay and oats, valued at iis., taken for 
tithes.'

John Calvert,^ son of Thomas Calvert, of Drumgor, Parish of

(May), 29, 1673, at the house of Roger Webb, to Judith Stamper, 
daughter of Hugh Stamper and Bridget, his wife, of Lurgan, 
County Armagh. Judith Stamper was born 3 Mo. 12, 1652, at 
" bowlton wood,"^ County Cumberland, England. 

John Calvert removed with his family about 1683 to Pennsyl- 
vania, and settled in Upper Providence Township, now Delaware 
County, where he owned 300 acres of land, granted to him by 
William Penn, i Mo. 13, 1683. An adjoining tract of 300 acres 
was also granted at the same time for Thomas Calvert, the father, 
who probably did not come to this country. Still another tract of 
100 acres, contiguous to the above, was granted on the same date 
to Margaret Calvert, probably the daughter of Thomas. On 2

Tho.mas Conway, or Connaway, of Lisburn, County Antrim, 
was married 4 Mo. 28, 1682, at the house of Francis Robson, 
Parish of Segoe, County Armagh, to Mary Hollinpsworth, daughter 
of Valentine (^Records of I.iirgan Mi'e/ing), and in the same year 
came over and settled near his father-in-law, in Brandywine Hun- 
dred, New Castle County. The records of Newark Jilonthly Meet- 
ing give the date of birth of a daughter, Mary Conaway, as 7 Mo. 
9, 1687, and the date of Thomas Connaway's death as 7 Mo. 17, 
1689. In 1693, the widow, Mary Connaway, married Randal 
Malin, of Upper Providence, and in 1727 removed and settled with 
her husband within the limits of Goshen Monthly Meeting. 

William Dixson and Isabelle Rea, both of Parish of Sego, 
County Armagh, Ireland, were married at the house of Roger 
Webb, Parish of Sego, 5 J\Io. 4, 1683. Among those who signed 
the marriage certificate were Henry Dixson, Rose Dixson, Thomas 
Harlan, and Isabelle Logan. — Marriage Book of Lurgan Mo. 
Mtg., Ireland. 

This, no doubt, is the same family that came over to New 
Castle Co., prior to 1690. Henry Dixson, it is said, kept an inn 
at New Castle and had three children : (I.) William was married 
about 1690 to Ann Gregg, daughter of William Gregg,' who, it is 
believed, also came from the north of Ireland. William was a 
weaver by trade and settled on Red Clay Creek, in Christiana 
Hundred, New Castle County. He made his will i Mo. 31, 
1708, and it was probated .Sept. 20, 1708. He mentions his wife 
Ann, and appoints his brothers, Michael Harlan and John Gregg, 

1 William Gregg settled on a tract of 400 acres of land in Christiana 
Hundred, New Castle County, surveyed to hira 3 Mo. 11, 1685. He 
died " ye 1st of ye 7th month and was buried on his own plantation 1687." 
Children: Richard; Ann; John, b. circa 1668, d. 1738, m. 11 Mo. 
1694, to Elizabeth Cooke [John Gregg, of Christiana Hundred, New 
Castle County, yeoman, aged about 67 years, made a deposition about 
1735, "that he has dwelt in the s"" County about" 51 years (No. 175, 
Miscellaneous Papers, i6jj~iSoj, Three Lower Counties, Hist. Soc of 
Penna. )]; George. It is presumed by the writer that William Gregg 
came from the north of Ireland with the Hollingsworths, Dixsons, Sharp- 
lys ; but no doubt the point could be fully proven if a diligent investigation 
were made in Ireland. 

One William Gregg, of Toberhead Mtg., and Ann Wilkinson, of An- 
trim Mtg., County Antrim, were married at Antrim, 11 Mo. 5, 1702 ; and 
George Gregg, of Toberhead Mtg. and Alice Richardson, of Ballyhagen

signed by : Thomas, Christian, and Catharine Harlan. {Records 
of Lurgan Mo. M/g.) I have seen no evidence to show that any 
of the family of Thomas Harlan came over to Pennsylvania. 

George Harlan settled at first about where the village of Cen- 
treville. New Castle Co., Delaware, now is, and the early meet- 
ings were held at his home. Later he removed farther up 
Brandywine Creek, and purchased 474 acres of land in Kennett, 
now Pennsbury, Township, Chester County. While living here 
he had for his neighbors over the creek, in a great bend, a settle- 
ment of Indians. After they had gone away he obtained, in 1701, 
a warrant for 200 acres of land in the bend of the creek, granted 
"in regard of the great trouble and charge he has bore in fenc- 
ing and maintaining the same for the said Indians while living 
thereon." He died in 1714, and was buried by the side of his 
wife at Centre Meeting House. 

In his will, dated 2 Mo. 21, 1714, probated 8 Mo. 2, 1714, 
George Harlan mentions his brother Michael Harlan, his ser- 
vant Mary Mathews, and directs that his body be interred in the 
new burying ground on Alphonsus Kirk's land. — Hist. Chester 
Co., p. 587 ; Chester County Wills. 

" George Harland [County Down, in 1680] had taken from him 
for Tithe, by Daniel Mac Connell . . . twelve stooks and a half 
of Oats, three stooks and a half of Early, and five loads of Hey,

Nathaniel Cart.mill and wife Dorothy came from Ireland to 
Pennsylvania, in 1685 and settled within the limits of Newark 
Monthly Meeting. They had at least two children : Martin, b. 
I Mo. 19, 1685, at sea on the voyage from Ireland ; and Thomas, 
b. 2 Mo. 29, 1689, disowned 12 Mo. 4, 171 5, for marriage out of 
Society {Records of Newark Mo. Mtg.). In 1689-90, Nathaniel 
Cartmill and Timothy Atkinson were each granted 200 acres of 
land in the Manor of Rockland, New Castle County, at a rent of 
one penny per acre, "being unwilling such good Husbandman 
should leave the Government" (Minutes of the Board of Prop- 
erty, Penn' a Archives, 2d Series, XIX., 25). At Newark Monthly 
Meeting, 7 Mo. 3, 171 5, Nathaniel Cartmill was dealt with for 
consenting to his son's marriage out of the Society ; for this 
breach of order he produced a satisfactory acknowledgment. 
In 1669, Godfrey and John Cantrell, of Queen's County, Ireland, 
had goods taken from them for refusing to contribute money for 
the church at Rosenallis (Besse's Sufferings of the Quakers, II.,

Gayen Miller, who first appears in Chester County in 1702, is 

thought to have been a near relative of John Miller, of New 
Garden. As stated on page 128, he purchased 200 acres at the 
site of Kennett Square, and in 1712 acquired 700 acres in New 
Garden. He also secured several other tracts. He took his seat 
in the Provincial Assembly in 1714. He died in 1742, leaving a 
will, dated 3 Mo. 31, 1742 (proved Aug. 31, 1742), in which he

of Friends, was born about 1645, perhaps in Cambridgeshire, and 
may have been the son of another Thomas Lightfoot who suflered 
persecution for his Quaker belief at Cambridge, in 1653,2 and was 
a companion of George Whitehead in his religious journeys. In 
1692, the younger Thomas was living in the neighborhood of

374 Imrnigratiofi of the Irish Quakers 

The following letter ' was written by an uncle of the emigrant, 
William Pirn, to his grand-nephew, Joshua Pirn, of Usher's Island, 
Dublin : 

"TULLYLAST, CO. KiLDARE, 1 

"Joshua PiM, ^ nth of ii mo. 1768. | 

Loving Cousin, 

In answer to thy request mentioned in 
thine of the 9th instant I send thee this : I can go no further 
back than to my great grandfather Richard Pirn, who before his 
marriage lived a considerable time, a cook, with (I think he was 
called) Sir John Stanhope, ancestor to the Earl of Chesterfield. I 
heard of but one brother that he had, called Robert Pim, who he 
said came into Ireland when young, of whom he heard no more. 
We suppose he was that Robert Pim that Sir John Temple men- 
tions to have been murdered by the Rebels at Graigue-ne-manch, 
in the County of Kilkenny. Richard Pim, before his marriage, 
had acquired what they call three livings ; I suppose that to be 
three small pieces of land with each a dwelling on it. 

He took a liking to a neighbor's daughter, a comely young girl 
of thirteen years of age, and as he and his fellow servants rode 
out on a merry-making, one of his fellow-servants took a pillow 
behind him and found her playing ball with other girls and asked 
her to go with them, which she did (it is probable that this was 
by conceit) and the said Richard married her and sent her to a 
boarding school for two years and then took her home at fifteen 
years of age. By her he had my grandfather, William Pim, and 
several daughters ; one married Godfrey Cantrell and one mar- 
ried to William Neale. 

My grandfather, William Pim, married Dorothy, the sister of 
William Neal, and dwelt if I remember right, at his grandfather 
Neales house in Castledunnington, in Leistershire, in the year 
1641 ; and in the year 1655 Godfrey Cantrell and family came 
into Ireland and Richard Pim, then very old, came with him and 
some time after died at Godfrey Cantrell' s house, near Rosenallis 
(in the Queen's County), and was buried in the Church at Rose- 
nallis. The same year my grandfather William Pim, and William 
Neal and families came over and settled in the County of Cavan, 
where after some years my grandfather died and was buried in his 
orchard at his own request, tho of the profession of the church of 
England ; about which time William Kdmundson and Richard 
Jackson and some other Friends retnoved to the (lueen's Co. 
William Edmundson settled near Rosenallis, Richard Jackson 
and my father near Mount Melick. My father had his mother to 
take care of, and one sister, Ellen, afterwards the wife of Thomas 
Nevitt. My father joined partnership with Richard Jackson in

Bradford ]\Ionthly Meeting 375 

the Butchering trade, and at Mount Mehck became acquainted 
with my mother, Mar)', the daughter of William Pleadwell, who 
was born at Normanton upon Sere, in Nothinghamshire. My 
grandfather, William Pleadwell and his wife came into Ireland in 
1655, they being Baptists, and settled near Killaloe. He had by 
his first wife Tobias Pleadwell, and by a second wife John Plead- 
well, and by a third wife Thomas Pleadwell and my mother and 
two other daughters, one of whom was married to William Neale ; 
and some time after my grandfather settled near Killaloe he was 
convinced by the ministry of Edward Burroughs and died not 
after ; and as his son Tobias Pleadwell was convinced some time 
before his father and settled at Mount Melick, my grandmother 
and her children came to dwell at Mountmelick, and in the year 
1663 my father & mother married and settled at Mountmelick ; 
but in the year 1665 my father and several other friends were 
sent to prisoners for Tythe to Maryborough Gaol, where they con- 
tinued prisoners for several years, though he had nothing tithe- 
able but a garden ; so he got a ho\ise in Maryborough for my 
mother to dwell in and by favour of the Gaoler or Gaolers fol- 
lowed some business in his trade at Maryborough, and after they 
were discharged from the prison he took a farm at Coalnecart, 
part of the lands thy father now holds, and in 1678 or 1679 he 
went to live at Mountrath. As to the feme and place of the births 
and burials of my brothers and sisters I refer thee to the abstract 
of the monthly meeting records of births and burials of Mount 
Melick Monthly Meeting, which abstract, so far as relates to 
Mountrath meeting is mostly in my handwriting. I suppose it is 
in the hands of John Clendenon. 

Thojias Pim. 
P. S. Richard Jackson, before mentioned, had three sons, 
John, Thomas and Robert, and one daughter, Sarah, the wife of 
Nicholas Gribble. John I had no acquaintance with : Thomas, 
thy grandfather, lived at Killenare, and Robert at Mountmelick : 
thy grandmother, Sarah Pim, was born at Killenare. Thou may 
get all their genealogies out of the records of births and burials 
of Mountmelick monthly meeting." i 

' Thomas Pim, the writer of the above letter, was the sixth son of John 
and Mary Pim. He resided at Mountrath until about 1735, when he went 
to live with his son's family at Tullylast, County Kildare. He died a few 
months after he wrote the letter, in his 86th year. He had two sons who 
had large families. My mother was his son Robert's eldest child. She 
was 16 years old when he died, and often spoke of him with great re- 
spect. His last grandchild, John Pirn, died last summer in his Sgth year. 
His sister, Hannah, died in her 91st year in 1849. There are now not any 
of his descendants of the name of Pim among Friends. — Robert Good- 
iody writing in 18^2.

THE IRISH QUAKER SETTLERS OF NEWTON, NOW 
IN CAMDEN COUNTY, NEW JERSEY 

Thomas Sharp, " woolstead comber," of Dublin, nephew of 
of Anthony Sharp, a wealthy Quaker merchant of that 
city, was one of the leaders of the Irish Quaker settlement 
of Newton, N. J. He has left the following interesting 
account of his immigration and settlement, written in 
1718: ' 

" Let it be remembered y' upon yi^ nineteenth day of September, 
in y" year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and eighty-one, 
Mark Newby, \Villiam Bates, Thomas Thackara, George Gold- 
smith and Thomas Sharp, set saile from y' Harbor belonging to 
y" city of Dublin in y^ Kingdom of Ireland, in a pink called Y' 
oiuner s adventure, whereof Thomas Lurtin, of London, was com- 
mander, and being taken sick in y'^ city, his mate John Dagger, 
officiated in his place ; in order to transport us, and y' we might 
settle ourselves in West Jersey, in America. And by y« good 
providence of God we arrived in y Capes of Delaware y eigh- 
teenth day of November following, and so up y' bay until we came 
to Elsenburg, and were landed with our goods and families at 
Salem, where we abode y° winter. But it being very favourable 
weather and purchasing a boat amongst us, we had an opportunity 
to make search up and down in y' which was called y"" Third tenth, 
which had been reserved for y« proprietors dwelling in Ireland, 
where we might find a place suitable for so many of us to settle 
down together, being in these early times somewhat doubtful of 
y*^ Indians, and at last pitched down by y' which is now called 
Newton creek, as y*^ most invitingist place to settle down by, and 
then we went to Burlington, and made application to y" commis- 
sioners y' we might have warrants directed to Daniel Leeds, y° 
Surveyor General, to survey unto every of us, so much land as 
by y constitution at y' time was alloted for a settlement being five 
hundred acres, or y' we had a right to, for a taking up it under, 
which accordingly we obtained. 

"At which time also Robert Zane, who came from ye city of 

'Liber A, of Gloucester County deeds, page 98, in the Office of the 
Secretary of State, Trenton, N. J. (See Judge Clement's First Sittlers in 
Newton, 24-26. )

Dublin, and had been settled in Salem, four years before, joined 
in with us who had a right to a tenth, Mark Newby to a twentieth, 
William Bates to a twentieth, Thomas Thackara to a twentieth, 
Thomas Sharp (out of his uncle Anthony Sharp's right) a 
twentieth, and George Goldsmith (under ye notion of Thomas 
Starkey's right) a tenth ; all which of us excepting William Bates 
who took his on ye southerly side of Newton creek, we took our 
land in one tract together for one thousand seven hundred and 
fifty acres, bounding in ye forks of Newton creek and so over to 
Cooper's creek and by a line of marked trees to a small branch of 
ye fork creek and so down ye same as by ye certficate of it stand- 
ing upon record in ye Secretary's office it doth appear. And 
after some time finding some incoveniency in ha\ing our land in 
common together being at ye time settled at ye place now called 
Newton in ye manner of a town for fear as aforesaid at which 
being removed we came to an agreement to divide. George 
Goldsmith he chose the head of the creek, Thomas Sharp the 
forks or lower end of the land next towards the river by which 
means the rest kept to their settlements without any disadvantage 
to themselves. 

And so ye land was divided according to every man's right.

Thomas Sharp." 

Thomas Sharp was Recorder and Clerk of the Courts of Glouces- 
ter County for many years. He was also a surveyor and made sev- 
eral important maps of the early settlements which are reproduced 
in facsimilein Judge Clement's /»i/&///6-r.f()/"A«i'/c«. Heacted 
as agent for his uncle, Anthony Sharp, of Dublin, who had large 
holdings in New Jersey. In 1684, he was made Commissioner 
of Highways, and in the following year was returned as a mem- 
ber of the Legislature. I n 1 700, he became Judge of the Glouces- 
ter County Courts. 

Thomas Sharp was married in 1684, to Sarah Fearn, of Darby. 
A daughter Elizabeth, m. 8 Mo. 3, 1709, at Darby, John, son 
of John and Mary Hallowell, and resided at Darby and New-

Irish ^takers of Newton 385 

Isaac Sharp, son of Anthony Sharp, of Dublin, came to New 
Jersey about 1702-3, and settled at Blessington, now 
Sharptown. 

He was Judge of Salem Court and served as a member of the 
Assembly from 1709 to 1725. About 1726 he returned to Ire- 
land and resided on his estate called " Roundxvood," in Queen's 
County, where he died in 1735. He married in 1704, Margaret 
Braithwaite, of Salem, and had children : Anthony. Isaac (of 
Blessington, Salem County, N. J., died in 1770. He was also 
Judge of Salem Court), Joseph, Sarah, Rachel (m. Daniel De- 
laney, of Queen's County, Ireland, by whom she had children : 
Sharp, William, Martin). — American Genealogist, 146. 

Robert Zane, of Dublin, "Serge Maker," pioneer settler of 
Newton, or the Irish Tenth, in Gloucester County, N. J., 
probably came out with John Fenwick and his party, in 
1675, for he was one of the members of the Friends' Meet- 
ing established at Salem that year. 

By deed of April 12, 1677, he became one of the Proprietors of 
West New Jersey. In 1679 he was married, at Burlington Meet- 
ing, to Alice Alday, who is thought to have been an Indian. In 
1681 he became a settler at Newton. He was elected to the first 
Legislature in 16S2, and was returned in 1685. He died in 1694, 
leaving his second wife, Elizabeth (daughter of Henry Willis, of 
Hempstead, Long Island), and several children to survive him. 

Children were : Nathaniel, b. about 1673, m. Grace Rake 

straw, of Philadelphia, in 1697 ; Robert, m. Jane ; Elna- 

than ; Simon ; Mary ; Esther; and Sarah. (For further details see 
Clement's First Settlers of A^ewton, 11-22, and Penna. Mag., 
XII., 123-25.) 

William Bates, carpenter, of County Wicklow, who was im- 
prisoned in 1670, for attending'Friends' Meeting at Thomas 
Trafford's house in Wicklow {Besse, II., 470), was one of 
a company of Friends who purchased a share of West New 
Jersey, by deed of April 12, 1677. 

He sailed from Dublin in September, in 1681, in Ye Owners 
Adventure, and settled with the other Irish Friends at Ne^vton, 
where he owned 250 acres of land. In 1683 he was one of the 
representatives from the Irish Tenth in the Legislature of the 
Province of West New Jersey, and was the same year appointed 
constable. The next year he was again returned as a member of 
the Legislature, and was appointed one of the commissioners for 
laying out highways. He died in 1700. His children, all bom

in Ireland, were : Jeremiah, m. Mary, daughter of Samuel Spicer ; 
Joseph, m. Mercy Clement, in 1701 ; Abigail, m. Joshua Fearne, 
in 1687 ; William, said to have married an Indian girl ; Sarah, 
m. Simon Ellis, in 1692.' 

George Goldsmith, a Friend, came over from Dublin, in 
Ye Owners Adventure, in 1681-2, and settled at Gloucester, 
N. J.» 

His grandson, James Parrock, a Friend, of Philadelphia, ship- 
wright, aged seventy-six years, in a deposition made at Phila- 
delphia, Jan. 2, 1751, states that his grandfather had formeily 
lived at Ballinakill, Queen's County, Ireland, and had served in 
Ireland as Lieutenant in Cromwell's Army.' 

John Hugo, from the Parish of Castle Ellis, County We.xford, 
was an early settler on Little Timber Creek, in the Newton 
settlement, where in 1683 he purchased 500 acres of land 
from Robert Zane. 

He served as a member of the Jersey Legislature in 1685. He 
died in 1706. His children were: John, Judge of Gloucester 
County courts, 1695-1706, Provincial Councillor of West New 
Jersey, etc., m. Priscilla, daughter of Francis Collins; Elias, m. 

Margaret, sister of Priscilla Collins ; Joseph, m. Sarah ; 

and Charles.' 

Mark Nevvbie, says Judge Clement, "was a resident of the 
city of London, and a tallow chandler." He was a mem- 
ber of a Friends' Meeting, whose house of worship was in 
a street of that city, called "Barbican, " and removed to 
Dublin, in i58i. 

Unfortunately the Judge does not give his authority for this 
statement or it might be confirmed ; but this date of removal to 
London is at least ten years too late, for Stockdale mentions 
Newbie as a persecuted Quaker shopkeeper residing in Thomas 
Street, Dublin, in 1 67 1. Says Stockdale : ' 

In 1 67 1, Mark Newby, of Thomas Street, Dublin, " because for 
Conscience sake he could not be an observer of Holidays (so- 
called) he opened his Shop on the 25th of the loth month, called 
Christmas day." For this he "had his house assaulted by a

rude multitude," who with great violence threw dirt and stones 
into "his Shop, endangering his Life and his Families ; spoyled 
Shop-goods, broke Glass-windows and Pewter vessels, abused their 
Neighbours for reproving them ; the said Mark was damnified " 
16 s. 6d. 

Mark Newby set out for New Jersey, in the latter part of 1681, 
in Ye Owners Adventure and settled at Newton, the first Friends' 
meetings being held at his house. In the political affairs of New 
Jersey he took a prominent part and filled several positions of 
trust and responsibility. At the May term of the Legislature, in 
1682, he appeared as a member, and was selected by the Gover- 
nor as one of his Council. He was made one of the Land Com- 
missioners and one of the Committee of Ways and Means to raise 
money for the use of the government. He died probably early 
in 1683, for at the May term of the Legislature in 1683 he is 
mentioned as deceased. 

As far as ascertained, he had two sons and two daughters : 
Rachel, m. Isaac Decou.in 1695 ; Stephen, m. Elizabeth Wood, 
in 1703; Edward, in Hannah Chew, in 1706; and Elizabeth, 
m. John Hogg, in 1 7 14. 

Hannah, the widow of Mark Newbie, married James Atkinson, 
in 1685.1 

Thomas Thackara, "stuff maker," of Dublin, by deed of 
April 12, 1677, in conjunction with other Friends, pur- 
chased one whole share of West New Jersey. 
He sailed with his family from Dublin, in September, 1681, in 
Ye. Ouiners Adventure, and settled on 250 acres at Newton. He 
became one of the leading men of the settlement, serving as a 
member of the first Legislature that sat at Burlington to frame and 
adopt laws for the Province. In 1682, he was appointed one of 
the Judges of the Court for the Irish Tenth and served until 1685, 
inclu-ive. He was also one of the land commissioners. The first 
Friends' meeting house built at Newton stood upon lands con- 
veyed by him to the trustees of the Society. He died about 1702, 
letters of administration on his estate being granted in that year. 
His first wife probably died after his settlement here, as in 1689 
he married Hepzibah, daughter of Francis Eastlake. 

Children were : Benjamin, m. Mary, daughter of William 
Cooper; Thomas, m. (i) Ann Parker and (2) Abigail Bates; 
Hannah, m. John Whitall ; Sarah, m. John Eastlack ; and Hep- 
zibah.'

388 hmnigration of the Irish Quakers 

John Jarvis, or Jervis,' a Friend, of Roscore, King's County, 
Ireland, with his son Martin, as stated in the deposition of 
James Parrock, made at Philadelphia, in 1751, was " obliged 
to fly from Ireland [in 168.S] with as much haste and pri- 
vacy as he could for fear of being massacred by the Papists." 
He came to New Jersey by way of Boston and took up his 
residence with his old friend George Goldsmith, of Glou- 
cester, N. J., where he remained until 1691, when he set- 
tled on a large tract of land which he had purchased at 
Cape May. He was appointed Justice of the Peace for Cape 
May County in 1695, 1696, and 1697. In 1701, he re- 
turned to Ireland. He had five' sons: I. Charles Jarvis' 
(b. about 1675 in Ireland, d. in London, in 1739) studied 
in London under Sir Godfrey Kneller, court painter, and 
became a celebrated artist. (He was a friend of Pope, the 
poet, and translated Don Quixote. — See National Diction- 
ary of Biography, XXIX., p. 354. ) II. John Jarvis, whoin 
1753,* was living in King's County, Ireland. III. Mathew, 
died young. IV. Trevor, died young. \'. Martin Jarvis, 
shoemaker, b. about 1675, d. 1742, says Parrock, settled for 
a time in Newton, then (jloucester County, N. J., and mar- 
ried in i6g8, Mary Champion (whose father John Champion 
came afterwards from Long Island and settled near Glouces- 
ter). In 1705, Martin Jarvis purchased a house and lot on 2d 
Street, between Market and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, 
and made his residence there the remainder of his life. 
His daughter Sarah married William Sandwith, an Irish 
Friend, of Philadelphia, and became the mother of Eliza- 
beth (Sandwith) Drinker (wife of Henry Drinker, of Phil- 
adelijhia, one of the Quaker exiles to Virginia, in the war of 
the Revolution), whose diary, ' covering the period 1759- 
1807, is a valuable record of the social life of the time.

THE MARSH FAMH^Y 

John Marsh, a Friend, of Armagh, County Armagh, Ireland, 
was residing in that town as early as 1664, for in his will, dated 
1688, he mentions "the half tenement and Garden plott Situate 
lying and being in the Scotch Street in Ardmagh which I have by 
lease from the primate of Ireland bearing date the twentyeth day 
of October 1664." He was staunch and true to his Quaker prin- 
ciples and on account of them had to endure severe persecutions. 
From the record of these sufferings it was evident that he was a 
thrifty yeoman or farmer, having servants and cattle and sheep, 



77/1? Marsh Favtily 407 

and raising wheat, oats, barley, etc. In 1660, "John Marsh 
[County Armagh] being sued for Milch-money and Offerings, to 
the value of about 3I. at the Manner Court of Loiighall (by Hum- 
phrey Pettard Priest) had taken from him so many of his Cattel 
as were worth 18I." 

"The said John Marsh being sued again, in the said Court, for 
five years' Tythe of sixty-two Sheep (by the said Priest) had the 
very whole number of sixty two Sheep taken from him (being all 
he had) worth 12I." ' 

In 1666, for refusing to pay tithes he had taken from him 
"Cattle and Sheep worth 2^3o," ' and in 1669 "John Marsh 
being sued for Priests and darks Dues (so-called) and such like 
things, to the value of 8s. 3d. in a Temporal Court at Anhnagh, 
by Thomas BieTzn Clark, had taken from him by the Bailiffs, a 
Brass Pot, and four Pewter Dishes, worth £1. 17s. ' In 1673, he 
was one "Of those who suffered Distress for Tithes of Corn, Hay, 
&c." * "In this and some preceding Years, several had suffered 
Distress for refusing to contribute to the repairing of the Parish 
Worship-house at Kilmore, in the County of Armagh." Among 
these, from John Marsh were taken "two Heifers, three Sheep, 
and two Calves, worth ^3. 7s."' In 1673 " John Marsh had taken 
from him for Tithe, for the Dean of Ardmagh, forty three stooks of 
Barly and fifteen car-loads of Hey, all worth one pound sixteen 
shillings." * 

"Anno 1674. Isabel Lancaster, Servant to John Marsh, of 
the County of Armagh, was sued in the Primate's Temporal Court 
for carrying Home her Master's Corn, under Pretence of its being 
Tithe, though it was neither markc nor set forth as such. An 
Execution was obtained against her, on which she was imprisoned 
in the Bayliff 's House, and after two Weeks removed thence to 
another Bayliff' s, where she was detained six months." ' 

In 1674 "John Marsh had taken from him for Tithe, by the 
Servants of James Downham, Dean of Ardmagh, thirty stooks of 
Barly out of two hundred thirty eight, and nine stooks of Oats out 
of three score and ten, worth one pound four shillings six 
pence." s He also suffered similar persecutions in 1675 and in 
1676.

Joseph Marsh, son of John Marsh, for some breach of discip- 
line, was disowned from membership in the Society of Friends, 

10 Mo. 5, 1674, at Lurgan Meeting, held at Roger Webb's 
house near Lurgan, County Armagh. In the testimony issued 
against him he is mentioned as late of Lisneny near Loughgall, 
County Armagh, widower, " who for several years past frequented 
our meetings." According to his father's will Joseph died prior to 

11 Mo. (Jan.) 7, 16S8, leaving at least two children, Joshua and 
Margery. 

Joshua Marsh, of Drumanicannon, Parish of Sego, County 
Armagh, son of Joseph Marsh, was married, 6 Mo. (Aug.), 28, 
1695, at Friends' Meeting place at Alexander Christy's, County 
Armagh, to Elizabeth Rogers, of Drumanicannon, possibly a 
daughter of John Rogers, whose name appears at the head of the 
list of men signers to the marriage certificate. Christy Rogers, 
who heads the list of the women signers, may have been the 
mother. The following interesting records of the marriage have 
been found : 

"At our [Ulster] Province Meeting held at Richard Boyes" 
house [near Ballinderry, County, Antrim] y^ 6th of y= 5th Mo. 
1695 . . . Joshua Marsh and Elizabeth Rogers haveing apeared

In addition to his share in the leased property in the town of 
Armagh, becjueathed to him by his grandfather John Marsh, 
Joshua Marsh owned a small farm in Ireland ; for in his will, 
made in Pennsylvania in 1747, he mentions "my farm in Bele- 



77/1? Marsh Family 411 

nacar in Clambrasel in the County of Armagh in the Kingdom of 
Ireland Containing Thirty three Acres of Land with the Rights 
members and Appurtnances thereof." 

Early in the spring of 1736. Joshua and his son John began to 
make ready to remove with their famihes to Pennsylvania. " Att 
a mens [Preparative] meeting [at Grange, near Charleniont, 
County Armagh] held ye 2d of ye 4th month [1736] Joshua March 
having an Intention to transport himself & family to America & 
desires from us a certificate therefore Jacob Marshill & James 
Pillar is desired to draw Suitable ones for him & his Son John 
. . . yt they may be Signed next meeting." 

In accordance with the request of the meeting certificates 1 were 
drawn up as follows : 

" From our Monthly Meeting of men & women friends, held at 
Grange Near Charlimount in the North of Ireland ye 2 of 4 Mo. 
1736. To friends and Brethren of pensylvania or elsewhere in

In the spring of 1736, shortly after the signing of the above 
certificates, the Marsh family started on the long and wearisome 
voyage to Pennsylvania, where they arrived, it is believed, some 
time in August, for in John Marsh's land warrant, dated Nov. 
24, 1736, he is mentioned as having been settled on the land 
"about three months." The two families of the father and 
son settled near each other on two tracts of land in East Nant- 
meal Township, Chester County, adjoining other Irish Friends, 
William and Timothy Kirk, of the Kirks of Lurgan Meeting, 
County Armagh. Soon after their settlement the Marshes were 
received as acceptable members of Goshen Monthly Meeting, 
Chester County, as appears from the following extracts from the 
minutes of that meeting : 

Minute of Men's Meeting, 8 Mo. 18,1736. — "John Marsh Pro- 
duced a Certificate to this Monthly Meeting from the .Monthly 
Meeting of friends held at Grange near Charlemount in ye North

Joshua Marsh settled on a tract of two hundred acres of land 
which he purchased from the Penn Proprietors. The following 
abstract of his land title is from the records preserved in the De- 
partment of Internal Affairs, at the capital, Harrisburg, Pa.:

ment of Nantmeal Meeting in 1740, and was appointed a repre- 
sentative from Uwchlan Preparative to Goshen Monthly Meeting. 

' See Sarvev, No. 446, Taylor Papers, HisL Soc of Penn'a.

to which Uwchlan was subordinate. The minutes of the Monthly- 
Meeting show that he was appointed on committees to inquire 
into requests for certificates of removal, to oversee marriages, 
etc. His name appears for the last time in the meeting records, 
9 Mo. I, 1745, when he signed a marriage certificate. He was 
taxed in East Nantmeal Township, in. 1737-8, is.; in 1739, is. 
3d ; in 1 740- 1, IS. 6d.' 

He died probably in the spring of 1748, for his will was made 
August 18, 1747, and probated May 17, 1748. As his wife is not 
mentioned in the will, he must have survived her. The following 
is a copy of the will :

hen Mo. Mtg., 3 Mo. 17, 1742. About 1750 John Marsh removed 
with his family from Chester County and settled on a tract of land 
adjoining his brother-in-law, Thomas McMillan, in Warrington 
Township, York County, Pa. The records at Harrisburg show 
the following purchases of land :

John Marsh was living in 1769, but the date of his death has 
not been learned. His wife, Elizabeth died in or prior to 1761. 
As far as can be learned they had the following children : i. 
John ; 2. Margaret ; 3. Joshua ; 4. Jonathan ; William (?) ; 
Ruth (?) 

I. John Marsh, born in Ireland, in 1724, died 3 Mo. 10, 1804, 
and was buried in Friends' graveyard at Warrington Meeting 
House, York Co., where his gravestone, with inscription, may 
still be seen. He probably removed from Chester to York Co., 
with his father, about 1750, but his certificate of remoxal from 
Goshen Mo. Mtg. , dated 8 Mo. 17, 1752, was not received at War- 
rington Mo. Mtg., until II Mo. 18, of that year. At Warrington

1740, " Thomas Atherton with the approbation of Uwchlan Pre- 
parative Meeting Proposes to joyn himself to our Religious So- 
ciety who is Received by us as his Conduct Proves Agreeable to 
our Our Principles." He was appointed an overseer of Nant- 
meal Meeting, in 1754. In 1763 he received a certificate to re- 
move with his wife Abigail and three children, Richard, Henry, 
and Elizabeth, to Warrington .Mo. Mtg., York County. The cer- 
tificate was received at Warrington, i Mo. 14, 1764. He died, 
probably in 1782, for his will' was dated Feb 2, 1774, and pro- 
bated Sept. 23, 1782. His wife and three children survived him. 
Children : (l) Henry ; (2) Richard ; (3) Elizabeth. 

1. Henry Atherton, m. 3 Mo. 22, 1780, at Warrington Mtg., 
to Ann Hobson, of the same place daughter of Francis and Ann 
Hobson, Friends from Ireland. In 1784, Henry was disowned 
by Warrington Mo. Mtg. for attending musters. About 1790 
they removed to Western Pennsylvania, and in 1794 were re- 
ported as living in the Glades of Stony Creek, probably in 
Bedford County. Children : Mary, Thomas, Francis, and Ann. 

2. Richard Atherton, m. 5 Mo. 18, 1775, to Phebe Hobson, 
sister of Henry's wife. The committee appointed to oversee the 
marriage reported that the occasion had been orderly, ' ' Except 
having assistants to pull off the glove and hat." In 1784 he 
produced an acknowledgment for marriage by a "hireling 
Teacher." He removed within the limits of Westland Mo. Mtg., 
about 1790. 

3. Elizabeth Atherton, m. i Mo. 16, 1777, to Alexander Elliot, 
of Newberry Twp., York County, son of Isaac, deceased. At 
Warrington Mo. Mtg., 6 Mo. 13, 1778 ; they were complained of 
by Newberry Mtg. for having differed and parted ; disowned 8 
Mo. 8, 1778. In his Diary (1780-1786) Benjamin Walker, of 
Warrington, under date of 5 Mo. 22, 1781, 3d-day, notes that he 
was " Diging a Grave for Elizabeth EUet formerly Atherton," at 
Warrington Friends' burial ground. 

VL Peter Marsh, with the concurrence of Uwchlan Prepara- 
tive Mtg., requested of Goshen Mo. Mtg., 4 Mo. 21, 1740, a 
certificate of removal to Oley (Exeter) Mo. Mtg., Berks County. 
The certificate was received at Exeter 6 Mo. 28, 1740. A certi- 
ficate for him to return to Goshen was signed by Exeter, 8 Mo. 
29, 1741. At Goshen Mo. Mtg., 6 Mo. 15, 1743, "The Repre- 
sentatives of Uwchlan Preparative Meeting Acquaints this Meeting 
that Peter Marsh Persists in keeping Company in Order for mar- 
riage with a young woman not of our Religious Society." At the

meeting 7 Mo. 12, 1743, he was reported married out of the So- 
ciety. He was then disowned, 9 Mo. 21, 1743, the testimony 
against him to be read at Nantmeal Meeting House. He was 
taxed in Nantmeal Township, in 1739. '" '^e tax list for 1 740-1 
his named has been crossed off. 

He removed to Warrington Township, York County, about 
1750, about the same time as his brother John and his brother-in- 
law Thomas McMillan, and settled on a tract of land at the foot 
of Round Top. A warrant (No. 36) for 25 acres of land "on a 
Branch of Beaver creek adjoining Robert V'eale [Vale] in War- 
rington Township," was granted to him May 7, 175 1 ; patented 
Dec. 7, 1762 (G. 489). In his will,' dated 4 Mo. 21, 1788, pro- 
bated April 4, 1789, bespeaks of his "meadow next Roundtop." 
He leaves 88 acres of land, which was surveyed May 3, 1753, to 
his son Jonathan, and mentions his other children, John, Mary 
Jones, Deborah Frazer, Jane Phillips, Lydia Brunton, Rachel 
Howe, Rebecca, and Esther. 

Deborah, daughter of Peter Marsh, born 4 Mo. 5, 1746 ; m. i 
Mo. 22, 1772, to Joshua Frazer, son of James and Rebecca (Cox) 
Frazer. A daughter, Elizabeth Frazer, married William Brinker- 
hoff, who when living in Ohio, in 1876, at the age of ninety-two 
years, gave the following interesting reminiscences* of the 
Marshes and Frazers : 

Peter Marsh's wife Margaret was a Welsh Quakeress of gigan- 
tic size. Deborah, the daughter, was buried beside her husband 
and parents at Warrington Meeting House. Joshua Frazer was 
first engaged to a younger sister of Deborah'sof about his own age, 
and they were to have been married in the spring of 1771 ; but 
in the fall of 1770, with an eye to securing some ready money to 
help him set up housekeeping, Joshua kissed his sweetheart good 
bye and went down into North Carolina to chop wood durinj^the 
winter. Here he met with such success that he concluded to stay 
a little longer than had been arranged for, and wrote to his in- 
tended to that effect. But, unfortunately for him, she never re- 
ceived his letter, and when he failed to appear at the proper 
time " the girl was mad and up and married another fcllar to 
wonst." 

Soon after, the young Joshua returned with his pockets weighted 
with hard earned money and his mind filled with pleasant anticipa- 
tions of the coming event. But, alas, for all his high hopes, the 
girl had gone with another man. 

At length, Deborah, an older sister, came to the rescue. It 
was true she was somewhat too old, but what better could be

done ? So, in 1772, she became my future mother-in-law. When 
Joshua asked Peter Marsh for Debby, Peter replied : 

"Joshua, I gave thee one girl, and I'm not going to give thee 
another. — But, if thee will come with two horses and a side- 
saddle, and the girl wants to go with thee, take her right along." 

The test was soon made and with a happy result for Joshua, 
for " the girl she climbed into the saddle, she did." 

VII. Jonathan Marsh was married, in 1748, by authority of 
Exeter Mo. Mtg., Berks Co., to Mary Long, of that meeting, 
probably a daughter of Robert and Rachel Long. The marriage 
was authorized 9 Mo. 24, and reported accomplished 10 Mo. 29, 
1748, so that the ceremony must have occurred between the two 
dates. He died shortly afterward, letters of administration on his 
estate being granted to his widow Jan. 19, 1749-50. The follow- 
ing inventory ' of his estate was filed March i. 1748-9 :

THE MOORES OF BALLINACREE, COUNTY ANTRIM 

James Moore,' Quaker, was residing on an extended estate in 
the Townland of Ballinacree,* Parish of Hallymoney, County 
Antrim, Ireland, as early as 1675. In that year he had "taken 
from him for Tithe, by James Cunningham, Tithemonger under 
John Dunbar Priest of Bellimunny Parish, twelve Stooks of 
Barley, forty nine Stooks of Oats, and seven car-loads of Hey, 
all worth three pounds four shillings six pence." (Stockdale, A 
Great Cry of Oppression, 48, printed in 1683.) The following 
year the same " Priest" took his oats, barley, wheat, and hay to 
the value of £2. 13s.; and thus each year down to 1682 he suf- 
fered a similar loss. In 1682, the birth of a son is thus recorded 
in the Friends' Registers : John Moore, son of James and Eliza- 
beth Moore, of Ballynacree, County Antrim, was born 6 Mo. 9, 
1682. 

A Friends' Meeting (Rutty, 343) was established at Ballinacree,' 

' According to the tradition in tlie family, the Moores came to Ireland 
from Cumberland, F.ngland, during the plantations of James I.

meeting house, tlio they have not yett gott y" place made Sure So they are 
Still desire to continue their care." 

Whether or not the plans for building a meeting-house were carried out 
at this time I have been unable to determine. In 1796, Thomas Scatter- 
good {Memoirs, 190) records in his journal that he " Rode to Ballynacree, 
and on the 22d (I Mo.) held the preparative Meeting. This meeting- 
house joins a dwelling, and on sitting down, it seemed like sitting in a 
cellar: two men, two women and three children composed it." On a 
visit in 1809, Thomas .Shillitoe ( Life of Friends' I.ihrary, I20-I ) says that 
Ballinacree Meeting consisted of parts of two families and that the Meet- 



The Moorcs of Ballinacree 429 

near B.-illymoney, in 1673, ^f^ doubtless was held at James 
Moore's house, as later meetings were regularly held there. 
JohnC.ratton, a Quaker minister, notes in \\\i Journal (iZ^,) under 
date of 6 Mo. 14, 1696, that he lodged at "J Moor's " at Balli- 
nacree. James Moore's daughter Alice was married in a Friends' 
Meeting at his own house, 10 Mo. 17, 1697, to Thomas Irwin, of 
Lisnegarvy {Minutes of Ulster Province Meeting). 6 Mo. 13, 
1698 at the Province Meeting there is mention of " y" men and 
womens meeting held at James Moors y' 30"* of y« ^ 1698." From 
this time on there are constant references to this meeting. In 
1698, lames Moore, of Ballymoney, was appointed on a commit- 
tee of the Province Meeting to obtain subscribers for Barclay's 
Apology. 

Thomas Story, a Quaker minister, gives the following account 
{Journal, 537) of his visit to the Moores, in 1716 : 

"On the 18th [7 Mo.], the great Rains having raised the 
Waters, we had but a small Meeting at Dunclaudy ; but a very 
broken tender Time it was, and we were generally comforted. 
That Evening I went forward about ten Miles to James Moor's at 
Ballimuny ; but his Wife being ill he directed us to his Son 
James about a mile farther ; where we staid that night. 

" On the 19th I had a Meeting near James Moor's, the elder ; 
which was small, being Harvest, and wet weather, and not so 
open as the last ; and yet a good Meeting. That Evening I 
went over the River again to Ely Crocket's." 

The following is an abstract of the will' of James Moore, made 
in 1727, and probated by his three sons who are styled 
' ' Quakers ' ' :

called the Lamb's Fold, at Enogh, near O'Hara Brook, about two miles 
west of Ballymoney.
