In drawing from this book, copy the last diagram, or finished picture, of the particular series 
before you. 

The other diagrams — beginning with number one, then number two, and so on — show how to 
go on with your drawing. They give the order in which to make the various strokes of the pencil 
that together form the completed picture. The dotted lines indicate where light lines are drawn that- 
help in construction — that is; getting proportions correctly, outlining the general form, or marking 
details in their proper places. Do not press ftaid on' the pencil in making these construction lines, 
then they can be erased afterwards. '.':■'. :i''. * ■' 

Use pencil compasses for the circles, or mark theto Off with buttons or disks.

DRAWING OVALS AND ELLIPSES 



Take note, first of all, of the difference between an ellipse and an oval. 

The large plate explains the construction of an ellipse. It shows how to find the points where 
the three pins are placed that determine the size of the looped string. Be sure and make measure- 
ments accurately. Use a string that will not give, cotton thread is good for small ellipses, silk is too 
elastic. A suggestion to amateur gardeners: make elliptical flower beds this way. 

The caution in regard to accuracy also applies to the making of the oval.

Here is a good list of colors for practical work. The 
first eight are enough for every purpose; but add, if you 
wish, purple and orange. Moist colors in pans are best. 
There are many different kinds of red, green, blue and 
brown paints; and as you may be puzzled and not know 
what to get, the names of the best hues of these particular 
colors are also given. The most useful paints in this list 
are yellow ochre, light red, Vandyke brown and Payne's 
gray. Learn to work with them, use them often and see 
the beautiful effects they produce. Delicate tints are made 
with thin washes of yellow ochre and light red. Vandyke 
brown makes a variety of pleasing tints. 

Use the bright colors sparingly. 

You do not need a black paint. Payne's gray with 
either brown, blue, crimson or green gives rich dark tones. 
Payne's gray is also useful in shadows and shading other 
colors. For the different kinds of greens, mix yellow ochre, 
blue or brown with Hooker's green. Use thin washes of 
light red and blue for the gray of distances and clouds.

WHAT TO DRAW 

THIS is really a remarkable book in 
which tine ia made a good rea$on for 
form. The youngest child may grasp 
the magic progress of this way of working 
knd he will draw the picture naturally and 
Mrell. 

INSTRUCTIONS are very brief, for the 
key line* of each object tell their own story 
uid the child is entranced by the results 
toon gained. There is no stupid tracing in 
this book, for tracing accomplishes at most 
Bnly a little muscular controL 

The book provides a step-by-step system

that fixet the object in memory and 6 
ops naturally a physical skill and a m 
knowledge of proportion and form. 

Foreshortening and perspective, t 
bugbears to young artists, are overcom 
the simplest progressive examples. 
REMEMBERING THE KEY LINE o 
the way to the completed object T 
are hundreds of pictures to draw and all 
those most fascinating to the child, wh
