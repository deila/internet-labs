INTRODUCTORY 



Tl 1 li present "Genealogical and Family History of the State of Maine" 
presents in the aggregate an amount and variety of genealogical and 
I>ersonal information and portraiture unci|ualled by any kindred pub- 
lication. Indeed, no similar work concerning Maine I-aniilies has ever l>efore 
been presented. It contains a vast amount of ancestral history never before 
printed. The object, clearly defined and well digested, was threefold: 

First. To present in concise forni the history of Maine Families of 
the Colonial Days. 

Second. To preserve a record of the prominent present-day people of 
the State. 

Third. To present through personal sketches the relation of its prom- 
inent families of all times to the growth, singular prosperity and widespread 
influence of Maine. 

There are numerous voluminous histr)ries of the State, making it 
unnecessary in this work to even outline its annals. What has been pub- 
lished, however, relates principally to civic life. The amplification neces- 
sary to complete the picture of the State, old and nowaday, is what is sup- 
plied by these Genealogical- and Family Memoirs. In other words, while 
others have written of "the times," the pro\ince of this work is to be a 
chronicle of the people who have made Maine what it is. 

Unique in conception and treatment, this work constitutes one of the 
most original and permanently valuable contributions ever made to the social 
history of an American commonwealth. In it are arrayed in a lucid and 
dignified manner all the im])ortant facts regarding the ancestry, personal 
careers and matrimonial alliances of those who. in each succeeding genera- 
tion, have been accorded leading positions in the social, professional and 

business life of the State. Nor has 

it been based upon, neither does it 

minister to, aristocratic prejudices 
and assumptions. On the contrary, 

its fundamental ideas are thoroughly 

American and democratic. The work 

everywhere conveys the lesson that 

distinction has been gained only by 

honoral)le public service, or bv use- 
fulness in private station, and that 

the de\elopment and prosperity of 

the State has been dependent upon the 

character of its citizens, and in the 

stimulus -which they haxe given to 

commerce, to industry, to the arts 

and sciences, to education and reli-

sjion — to all that is comprised in the highest civilization of the present day 

through a continual progressiNe devcloijnient. 

The inspiration underlying- the jirescnt \voH< is a fervent appreciation 
of the truth so well expressed by Sir Walter Scott, that "there is no heroic 
poem in the world hut is at the bottom the life of a man." And with this 
goes a kindretl truth, that to know a man. and rightly measure his char- 
acter, and weigh his achievements, we must know whence he came, from 
what forbears he sprang. Truly as heroic poems have been written in 
human lives in the paths of peace as in the scarred roads of war. Such 
examples, in whatever line of endeavor, are of much worth as an incentive 
to those who come afterward, and as such were never so needful to be writ- 
ten of as in the present day, when pessimism, forgetful of the splendid 
lessons of the past, withholds its effort in the present, and views the future 
only with alarm. 

Every community with such ample history as Maine, should see that 
it be worthily supplemented by Genealogical and Personal Memoirs of its 
leading families and prominent citizens. Such a work is valuable in its his- 
toric utility as a memorial of the development and progress of the com- 
nnmity from its very founding, and in the jiersonal interest which attaches 
to the record made by the individual. 

Out of these considerations the authors and publishers have received 
encouragement and ap[)roval of authorities of the iiighest standing as gen- 
ealogists, historians and litterateurs. In the production of this work, no pains 
have been spared to ensure absolute truth — that quality upon which its value 
in every feature depends. The material comprising the genealogical and per- 
sonal records of the active living, as well as of the honored dead, have been 
gathered by men and women experienced in such work and acquainted with 
local history and ancestral families. These have appealed with confidence 
to the custodians of faniil\- records concerning the useful men of preceding 
generations, and of their descendants' who have lived useful and honorable 
lives. Such custodians, who availed themselves of this opportunity of having 
this knowledge placed in preservable and accessible form, have performed 
a jniblic service in rendering honor to whom honor is due, in preserving 

the distinction which rightfully 
belongs to the Colonial Fami- 
lies, and which distinguishes 
them from later immigrations; 
and in inculcating the most val- 
ualile and enduring lessons of 
liatriotism and good citizenship. 
Than Maine, no other State 
or region offers a more ])eculiar- 
ly interesting field for such re- 
search. Its sons — "native here, 
and to the manner born," and

INTRUIJUCTORY iii 

• 
of splendid ancestry — Iiave attained distinction in every field of human 
eflfort. An additional interest attaches to tlie present undertaking- in the 
fact that, while dealing- primarily with the history of native Maine, this 
work approaches the dignity of a national epitome of genealogy and biog- 
raphy. Owing to the wide dispersion throughout the country of the old 
families of the State, the authentic account here jiresented of the constituent 
elements of her social life, past and present, is of far more than merely 
local value. In its special field it is, in an appreciable degree, a reflection 
of the development of the country at large, since hence went out repre- 
sentatives of historical families, in various generations, who in far remote 
places — beyond the Mississipjii and in the h'ar West — were with the van- 
guard of ci\-ilization, building- up communities, creating new common- 
wealths, planting, wherever thev went, the clun"ch, the schoolhousc and the 
nrinting press, leading into channels of thrift and enterprise all who gath- 
ered about them, and proving a power for ideal citizenshi]) and good 
government. 

These records are presented in a series of independent genealogical and 
personal sketches relating to lineal familv heads, and the most conspicuous 
representatives in the present generation. There is an entire avoidance of 
the stereotyped and unattractive manner in which such data is usually pre- 
sented. The past is linked to the present in such style as to form a sym-_ 
metrical narrative exhil)iting- the lines of descent and the history of distin- 
guished menibcrs in each generation, thus giving to it a distinct personal 
interest. That these ends are conscientiously and faithfully ccjnserved is as- 
sured by the cordial personal interest and recognized capability of the super- 
vising editors, of promii-ient connection with the leading patriotic societies, 
all of whom have long pursued genealogical in\estigations with intelligence 
and enthusiasn-i. 

A very happy arrangement was that which secured the services of 
George Thomas Little, A. M., Litt. D., as editor-in-chief. Of course, it 
was a physical impossibility for Professor Little to conipile all the matter 
for this work, Init his aid and assistance have been invaluable, and many 
articles herein are the pmduct of his pen. Rev. Henry S. Burrage, D. D.. 
has also been a very valuable contributor. The efficient aid of Mr. Nathan 
Goold. Librarian of the Maine Historical Society, is gratefully acknowl- 
edged. His familiarity with the 
history of Maine and its families, 
~^-. and with the authorities touching 
the san-ie. have been of much value. 
antl his knowledge has been gener- 
ous!}- afforded at all times when 
called upon. The same may be

iv INTRODUCTORY 

the state liave contributed aid in many ways. One of the most active and 
dihgent writers is J. C. Jenning-s. Esq.. a native of Wayne, Androscoggin 
coimty, wliose tliorough scholarship and cntlnisiasm and interest in genealog- 
ical work ha\e made his services invaluable. 

After two years of diligent labor, the publishers place this work in the 
hands of their patrons and in libraries, with the confident assurance that it 
will be found a valuable assistance to coming generations of the Sons of 
Maine, in tracing their ancestry. It is believed that it includes the main 
stem of the familv tree of every family of any importance in Maine, and 
in many cases it has been practicable to carry down several lines to the 
present time. It has reached out to cities of the West, as well as the East, 
where worthy Sons of Maine are now abiding, and has brought together and 
made acquainted many remotely separated and divergent lines of descent 
from a common ancestor. In all cases, the matter for the work has been 
submitted in typewritten manuscript to the persons most interested, for cor- 
rection. If, as occurs at times, a sketch is faulty or incomplete, the short- 
coming is mainly ascribable to paucity of data, or conflicting records, many 
families being at disagreement with regard to given names and dates. 

It is believed that the present work, in spite of the occasional fault which 
always attaches to such undertakings, will prove a real addition to the mass 
of annals concerning the old families of Maine, and that, without it, much 
• valuable information would be left inaccessible to the general reader, or 
irretrievably lost, owing to the passing away of custodians of family records, 
and the consequent disappearance of material in their possession.

STATE OF MAINE. 



The earliest family of Clif- 
CLIFFORD fords in New England, that 

of George Clifford, though 
for a time resident of Massachusetts, may be 
called a New Hampshire family, as George 
and all his children settled and lived in New 
Hampshire, and from him, as the only seven- 
teenth century innnigrant who is known to 
have left posterity, all the New England Clif- 
fords of the earliest times are said to be de- 
scended. The only other immigrant of this 
name before 1700 was John of Lynn, who is 
not said to have left children. 

(I) George Clifford, the immigrant, de- 
scended directly from the ancient and noble 
family of Clifford in England, came from the 
village and parish of Arnold, Nottingham 
county, England, to Boston, in 1644, prob- 
ably bringing his wife, whose name seems to 
have been Elizabeth, and a son John. He was 
a member of the Ancient and Honorable Ar- 
tillery Company. After residing for a time 
in lloston he removed to Hampton, New 
Hampshire. 

(II) John, son of George and Elizabeth 
Clifton!, was born in England in 1614, and 
baptized, says Savage, May 10, 1646. He died 
October 17, 1694, "aged eighty years," accord- 
ing to the town records. His first wife was 
Sarah; he married (second), September 28, 
1658. Mrs. Elizabeth Richardson, who died 
December 1, 1667: and (third), February 6, 
1672. Mrs. Bridget Huggins, widow of John 
Huggins. His children were: John, Israel, 
Hannah, Elizabeth (died young), Mehelabel, 
Elizabeth, Esther, Isaac and Mary. 

(III) Israel, second son of John Clift'ord, 
was born in Hampton, April 15, 1647, ^"d 
took the oath of allegiance in 1678. He mar- 
ried, March 15, 1680. Ann Smith, probably 
the same Ann who was alleged to be a victim 
of Goody Cole's witchcraft. Their children 
were: Ann, Mehetabel, Samuel, Sarah, John, 
Isaac and Richard. 

(IV) Isaac, si.xth child of Israel and Ann 
(Smith) Clift'ord, was born in Hampton, May 
24, 1696. and settled in Kingston, originally a 
part of Hampton. In 1745 he bought land of 
Samuel Healy, the same being one-fourth of 



No. no, U. 11. He linally moved to Runi- 
ney, where the latter part of his life was spent, 
and there he was a citizen of considerable 
prominence and was for many years collector 
and treasurer of the town. He married Sarah 
Healey, born in Cluster, 1726, daughter of 
William and Mar\- (.Sanborn) Healey, of 
Chester. The\ had ten children, eight of 
whom were: -Sarah, Elizabeth, Bridget, Isaac, 
Nathaniel, John, Samuel and Joanna. 

(V) Nathaniel, fifth child of Isaac and 
Sarah (Healey) Clifford, was born in Rum- 
ney, in April, 1750, and died January 23, 1824. 
Ele was much like his father — active, public 
spirited and respected, and was for years 
town treasurer and collector. He married 
Ruth Garland, of Candia, born in September, 
1757. Their only child was Nathaniel, whose 
sketch follows. 

(\T) Deacon Nathaniel (2), only son of 
Nathaniel (i) and Ruth (Garland) Clifford, 
was born in Runme_\-, September 2t„ 1778, and 
died 1820. Deacon Clift'ord was of a serious 
turn of mind, a tritle stern and Puritanical, 
perhaps, but highly respected for intelligence 
and uprightness of character. He married 
Lydia Simpson, born October 7, 1773, daugh- 
ter of David Simpson, of Greenland. She was 
a woman of great personal beauty and unusual 
energy, vigor and perspicacity. Her mental 
characteristics were transmitted to some of iier 
descendants. She lived to see her son Nathan 
one of the supreme court judges of the United 
States. She died June 30, 1869, in the ninety- 
sixth year of her age. The children of this 
union were: Mary Williams, Betsy Ham, 
Nathan, Nancy Hutchins, Ruth Garland, 
Katherine Simpson, and Lydia Simpson. 

(\'II) Hon. Nathan, only son of Deacon 
Nathaniel (2) and Lydia (Simpson) Clifford, 
was born in Rumney, Grafton county. New 
Hampshire, August 18, 1803, and died in 
Cornish, Maine, July 25, 1881. His father 
was able to provide a comfortable home for 
his family, but their circumstances, like those 
of their neighbors on the frontier of New 
Hampshire, in those days, were far different 
from those which obtain there now, and Na- 
than Clifford had to put forth all his energies

to ac<|uire the education he got. He attended 
school in his native town until he was four- 
teen years of age, and then by great effort 
overcame objections to his going away to ob- 
tain a more extended education and entered 
Haverhill Academy, where he remained three 
years. He was an industrious and earnest 
student, and made good progress in his stud- 
ies, but was compelled to spend a portion of 
each year in teaching school to obtain money 
to pay his expenses. Besides teaching school 
he gave instruction in vocal music, for which 
he hnd rare taste and talent. He left the 
Haverhill school in 1820, and then took a 
year's course in the New Hampton Literary 
Institution, which he left at eighteen years of 
age. He then entered the law office of Hon. 
Josiah Quincy, then the leader of the Grafton 
county bar. At that time admission to the 
bar of New Hampshire required of those not 
college graduates a period of five years" study 
to prepare for practice. While in the acad- 
emy Mr. Clifford had pursued a broad course 
of general reading, and this he kept up, after- 
wards giving much attention to the study of 
the classics as taught in the regular courses of 
the New England colleges. Having to make 
his own way he continued to teach while a 
student at law, and up till near the time of his 
admission to the bar in May, 1827. Leaving 
New Hampshire he crossed over into the bor- 
der town of Newfield, in York county, Maine. 
and there opened an office. His thorougn 
preparation for his work, remarkably retentive 
memory and good habits formed a foundation 
upon which the young man soon reared the 
superstructure of success. He gained the con- 
fidence and got the business of the people. He 
entered the political arena early, and became a 
•warm supporter of the principles of Democ- 
racy, though there were in Newfield scarce 
twenty men of that faith. He had inspired so 
much confidence in his fellow citizens that in 
1830, only three years after settling in New- 
field, he was elected by a large majority to 
represent the town in the state legislature. To 
this office he was three times successively re- 
elected. At the beginning of his third term he 
was elected speaker of the house, and at the 
next session was again elected. Lie soon be- 
came one of the ablest leaders among the 
Maine Democrats, and at the same time that 
he was gaining a leadership in politics he car- 
ried on a successful practice of law. In 1834 
be was appointed attorney general of the 
state. This office he filled with ability until 
1838, when he was nominated for congress 
from the first district. In the exciting politi- 



cal conflict which followed he was elected. 
Before his term was out he was renominated, 
and again elected, — his term of service cover- 
ing the period between December 2, 1839, and 
March 3, 1843. \\ hen he left congress his 
reputation as an able and zealous leader and 
an accomplished parliamentarian was firmly 
establis^ieil. During the presidential canvass 
of 184D he supported Martin \'an Buren, and 
met in political debate many distinguished 
Whig orators, and gained for himself the 
reputation of being one of the most eloquent 
champions of his party. Though originally 
favoring the reelection of \'an Buren to the 
chief magistracy of the nation, he supported 
the nomination of Polk with earnest and ei- 
fective ardor, and in 1S46 was offered the 
appointment of attorney-general in President 
Polk's cabinet, to accept which he gave up a 
very extensive legal practice at home. He 
found the duties of the office congenial to his 
tastes, and his administration was such as to 
prove him a worthy successor of the best of 
those who had preceded him. While he was 
a member of the cabinet the war with Mex- 
ico was in progress, and at its close i\Ir. Clif- 
ford became a member of the United States 
commission with the power of envoy ex- 
traordinary and minister plenipotentiary, to 
arrange terms of peace, and through his ef- 
forts the treaty was arranged with Mexico, by 
which California became United States terri- 
tory. In September, 1849, with the outgoing 
of the administration, he returned to Maine 
and settled permanently in Portland, where he 
carried on his law practice until 1858. Jan- 
uary 12 of that year he was appointed asso- 
ciate justice of the supreme court of the 
United States, and served as a member of that 
august body for more than twenty-three years. 
Judge Clifford was now fifty-five years old, 
and in the full vigor of his physical and in- 
tellectual faculties. He found himself a=50- 
clated with a bench, the majority of v.-hich 
were old men rendered slow by age and that 
habitual caution which attends the con- 
scientious exercise of judicial functions. The 
business of the court was far in arrears, and 
to the work of relieving this condition he ap- 
plied himself with characteristic energy, and 
by continuous labor saw the docket much re- 
duced. His opinions as a federal justice form 
a respectable part in number and importance 
of the forty volumes of reports issued up to 
the time of his death. Chief Justice Salmon 
P. Chase died May 7, 1873, and Judge Clifford 
succeeded to the place thus made vacant. The 
presidential election of 1876 was not settled 



STATE OF MA INK. 



by pui>ular ballut, and by a hpccial act <>i con- 
gress the matter was referred to an electoral 
commission of fifteen men, over whose delib- 
erations Judge Clifford, as senior associate 
justice, presided in the early part of the fol- 
lowing year. The highest office within the 
gift of the American people was in the bal- 
ance, men's minds were heated, and the dis- 
cussions were frequently acrimonious, but dur- 
ing all this, although a firm believer in Mr. 
Tihlen's election, he conducted the proceedings 
with the dignity and impartiality of an ancient 
Roman, retaining perfect calmness, evincing 
wisdom and fairness in his decision, and, even 
winning the commendation of his opponents. 
He agreed with the minority and delivered an 
opinion on the question of tlie Florida returns, 
but deeming it of no avail, he rendered no 
<public judgment on the votes of the other con- 
tested states. For several years before his 
death. Judge Clifford was at liberty, if he 
chose, to retire from the bench and receive 
the pension provided by law, but relinquish- 
ment of duty was not in accordance with his 
disposition or the habits of his life, and he con- 
tinued with unabated clearness and force of 
mind to perform his judicial labors until over- 
taken by his last sickness. In October, 1880, 
he was seized by serious illness involving a 
complication of disorders, and was obliged to 
submit to amputation of the foot. From this 
he never fully recovered, and he died in Cor- 
nish, Maine, July 25, 1881. Mason's "Bench 
and Bar" thus closes its account of this illus- 
trious citizen : 

"Judge Clififord was a man of noble and 
commanding presence, and exhibited in his 
bearing and manner a graciousness and dig- 
nity combined that both won afifection and in- 
spired respect. Strength, culture and intellect 
were written on his face. He was a man of 
unyielding determination and immense ca- 
pacity for study and investigation, and faced 
every duty, however onerous, with cheerful- 
ness and confidence in himself. He possessed 
the genius of labor, industry, truthfulness, in- 
tegrity and entire fidelity on the performance 
of duty were among his leading characteris- 
tics. The urbanity and courtesy which marked 
his intercourse with men, secured the friend- 
ship of a wide circle of eminent persons with 
whom he came in contact during the many 
years of his public life. The judge was of a 
temperament to prize such associations and 
cherished the friendships which he had thus 
formed to the end of his life. The simplicity, 
elevation and solidity of his character im- 
pressed all with whom he came in contact, A 



memor\- of wonderful power easily retained 
the fruit of a long, arduous and studious life. 
Bowdoin, Dartmouth, Brown and Harvard all 
conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of 
Laws. In the proceedings of the supreme 
court of the United Stales as well as in the 
circuit courts of the county, held to honor his 
memory, bench and bar united in conceding to 
the venerable magistrate the character of a 
great, wise and just judge." 

Judge Clifford married, March 20, 1828, at 
Newficld, Maine, Hannah Ayer, born in \'ew- 
field, March 3, 181 1, died in Portland, Maine, 
August 2, 1892, aged eighty-one, daughter of

(VHI) William Henry, third son of Judge 
Nathan and Hannah (Ayer) Clifford, was 
born in Newfield, Maine, August 11, 1838. 
After leaving the public schools he fitted for 
college at Portland Academy and at Profes- 
sor Woods's school at Yarmouth. After 
spending four years in Dartmouth College he 
graduated there in 1858. Soon afterward he 
began the study of law in the office of Shepley 
& Dane, of Portland, and completed the course 
in the ofiice of Benjamin R. Curtis, in Boston. 
He was admitted to practice in the courts of 
Massachusetts in 1863; in Maine and in the 
United States circuit court in 1864; and in the 
United States supreme court in 1867. After 
his admission to the bar he opened an office in 
Portland, where he practiced his profession 
up to the time of his death, September 18, 
1901. F-or about ten years he was a commis- 
sioner of the United States circuit court for 
the District of Maine, and afterwards ac- 
quired extensive practice in the federal courts 
and before the supreme coun at Washington. 
He was author of "Clifford's Reports," a com- 
pilation in four volumes of his father's deci- 



STATF. OF MAINE. 



sions ill tlie New England circuit. From 
young manliood he was interested in the poUti- 
cal contests in Maine, on the Democratic side, 
and from the time of the civil war was quite 
prominent as a leader in campaigns. Twice he 
was nominated as Democratic candidate for 
congress in the First Congressional District — 
once against John H. Burleigh, and the second 
time as the opponent of Thomas B. Reed, and 
won credit and respect by both his abilities and 
powers as a [wlitical speaker, and by the vigor 
and energy of his campaigns. He was a mem- 
ber of the Democratic national committee, and 
presided over a number of state conventions 
of the party. In 1896 he was candidate for 
governor of Maine on the ticket of the Gold 
Democrats. He was fond of literature ; was a 
member of the Maine Historical Society, and 
was. author of several pamphlets on literary, 
political and other subjects. His degree of 
Master of Arts was conferred by Bishops Col- 
lege, l.eno.\ville. Province of Quebec. He 
was a member of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church, and for some time served as vestry- 
man in St. Luke's Cathedral. He was a mem- 
ber 61 the Cumberland Club of Portland, and 
the Union Club of Boston. He was afifiliated 
with various Masonic bodies, including the 
Commandery ; and w-ith the orders of Odd 
Fellows and Knights of Pythias. It has been 
written of him: "He was a man of scholarly 
tastes anil broad culture ; always a studL-nt, his 
reading was both extensive and exhaustive. 
He was an authority on many literary and his- 
torical subjects, and the addresses which he 
delivered from time to time on such subjects 
bore evidence of his natural ability and wide 
learning.'" 

Mr. Clifford married, August 8, 1866, Ellen 
(ireeley I'.rown. born in Portland, May 30, 
1841, died there May 9, 1904, daughter of 
John B. and .^nn M. (Greeley) Brown, of 
Portland. Children: i. Nathan ; see forward.

who (lied young, were John B. and Ellen 
Ayer. 

( IX) Hon. Nathan (2), eldest child of Hon. 
William H. and Ellen G. (Brown) ClifTonl. 
was born in Portland, June 17, 1867. He at- 
tended the public schools of Portland, Phillips 
Andovcr .\cademy. and the Portland iiigh 
school, graduating from the latter in 1886. In 
the fall of the same year he entered Harvard 
University, from which he graduated with 



high iionors in June, 1890. Immediately after 
graduation he entered upon the study of law 
in the office of his father in Portland and was 
admittc<l to the bar three years later, in -May, 
1893, and became a member of the lirm of 
Clifford, X'errill & Clifford, the present lirm. 
The marks of heredity are discernible in Mr. 
Clifford, and he displays much of. the ability 
that distinguished his progenitors. As a law- 
yer he ranks high, and in the Democratic 
party, of which he is an honored member, he 
is regarded as a wise counselor and successful 
leader. His interest in politics began at an 
early age, and his activity in party matters be- 
gan immediately after his graduation from 
college. He has filled various offices in the 
party and in the municipality. In 1895 he 
was made chairman of the Democratic cit^ 
committee. In 1905 he was elected mayor of 
Portland, and was re-elected the next year. 
His election to succeed himself in this office 
was the first instance in the liistory of the city 
where a Democrat was his own immediate suc- 
cessor. His administration of municipal busi- 
ness gave great satisfaction, but when he was 
made candidate for a third term, in 1907, he 
was defeated by Adam P. Leighton. Mr. Clif- 
ford is a member of tht Maine Historical So- 
ciety ; the Alaine Geological Society; vice- 
president of the Harvard Club in Maine, and 
the New England Federation of Harvard 
Clubs ; director of the Harvard Alumni .■\sso- 
ciation ; and member of the Cumberland Club, 
and various other bodies. Mr. Clifford mar- 
ried, in Boston, May 5, 1897, Caroline L. 
Devens, born in Charlestown, Alassachusetts, 
April 6, 1872, daughter of Captain Edward 
Fesser and Abbie Maria (Fairbanks) Devens; 
her father was an officer in the United States 
navy. Children of Air. and Mrs. Clifford: 
Katharine Louisa, born 1898; Nathan Jr., 
1900; William Henry, 1904.

William H. and Ellen G. (Brown) Clifford, 
was born in Portland, July 28, 1875. He was 
educated in public schools of Portland, Chaun- 
cey Hall school, Boston, and Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. He reatl law in the 
office of Clifford, Verrill & Clifford at Port- 
land. At the outbreak of the Spanish-.Vmeri- 
can war, he organized the naval reserve of 
Maine and was elected junior lieutenant; the 
reserves were ordered to the monitor "Mon- 
tauk" and stationed in Portland harbor during 
the summer of 1898. At the close of the war 
Mr. Clifford went to Annapolis, Maryland, 
and after studying for a few months passed 
the examination for first lieutenant of United

holding various important offices in that or- 
der. He married, October 12, 1907, Mabel

in Portland, September 11, 1882. He at- 
tended the public schools and prepared for col- 
lege by studying under private tutors ; in 1899 
he entered Bowdoin College, graduating 
therefrom in 1903. He then took up the study 
of law at Harvard College, and also read law 
in the office of his brother, Hon. Nathan Clif- 
ford. He was admitted to the bar in 1906, 
and at once established himself in practice. He 
is a member of the Cumberland Club, Portland 
Country Club, Portland Yacht Club, and the 
following college fraternities : Psi Upsilon, 
Phi Beta Kappa and the Crown and Coffin. 
Mr. Clifford married, October 11, 1905, 
Katharine Hale, daughter of Judge Clarence 
and Margaret (Rollins) Hale, the former 
named being judge of the United States Dis- 
trict Court (see Hale family). Mr. and r^Irs. 
Clifford have one child, Margaret Ellen Clif- 
ford. 



It is supposed that the name of 
HA;\ILIN Hamlin is originally of Ger- 
manic origin, perhaps derived 
from the town of Hamlin in Lower Saxony 
situated at the junction of the river of Hamel 
with the Weiser. The name Hamelin is still 
common in France, whence some have emi- 
grated to this country and to Quebec, where 
they have become numerous. In England this 
name was formerly spelled Hamblen. Hamelyn, 
Hamelin and Ilamlyn. As the name is found 
in the "Roll of Battle .Vbbey" it is undoubtedly 
of French origin, and was brought into Eng- 
land by a follower of the Norman conqueror. 
Burke's Encyclopedia of Heraldry describes 
several coats-of-arms belonging to the Hamb- 
lens and Hamlyns. Representatives of the 
distinguished American family of this name 
participated in the war for national independ- 
ence and the civil war. It has produced a 
goodly number of able men including clergy- 
men, lawyers, jihysicians and statesmen, and 
its most distinguished representative of mod- 



ern times was the Hon. Hanniijal i lamhn, 
vice-president of the United States during 
Abraham Lincoln's administration, for many 
years a member of the national senate from 
Maine and afterwards minister to Spain. A 
numerous progeny sprung from Captain Giles 
Hamlin, who immigrated to Middletown, Con- 
necticut, in 1650. It is supposed that James 
and Giles were brothers, but their relation- 
ship, like the connection between Sire de Balon 
and Ilamelinus, was never determined. At 
the time Giles came to this country, Lewis 
Hamelin of France settled in Canada and es- 
tablished the Flamlin family of that part of the 
continent. 

The English ancestor of the Hamlins of 
New England appears to be John Hamelyn, 
of Cornwall, living in 1570, and who married 
Amor, daughter of Robert Knowle, of Sarum. 
This couple had a son and heir who lived in 
Devonshire by the name of Giles. Giles 
Hamelin or Hamelyn married a daughter of 
Robert Ashley and had two sons : Thomas, 
Gentleman, London, 1623, and James. James 
is the ancestor of the larger part of the Ham- 
lin race in this Republic. He made a voyage 
to Cape Cod unaccompanied by his family, and 
there made a home for them at Barnstable. 
He then returned to England, and in 1639 
brought back his w^ife and several children. 

(I) James, son of (jiles and (.Vsh- 

ley) Hamelin, lived, and his children were 
baptized in the church in the parish of St. 
Lawrence, Reading, Berkshire, England, be- 
tween 1630 and 1636. These children were: 
I. James, baptized October 31, 1630, died be- 
fore April, 1636. 2. Sarah, baptized Septem- 
ber 6, 1632. 3. Mary, baptized July 27, 1634. 
4. James, baptized April 10, 1636. The first 
record of his children born in America is : 
Bartholomew, born in Barnstable, Plymouth 
Colony, April 11, 1642. A child, Hannah, was 
probably born in England between 1636 and 
1642, but no record of her birth appears either 
in luigland or New England. James Ham- 
lenc appears among the list of freemen in 
Barnstable in 1643 and James Hamhlen Jun- 
ior, and James Hamhlen Senior, on list of 
freemen May 29, 1670. He made his will 
January 23, 1683, and Governor Hinckley and 
Jonathan Russell witnessed the signing and 
sealing of the will. In this will he names his 
wife as Anne, but no other record of her name 
has been found. The children of James and 
.\nne Hamlin not certainly Iwrn in England 
are: 6. Hannah. 7. Bartholomew. 8. John, 
born June 26, 1644. 9. A child, stillborn and

lived on the Coggin's Pond lot owned by his 
father up to 1702, when he removed to Hamb- 
lin Plains in W'est Berkshire. In his will, 
made in 171 7, he claims to be a resident of 
Tisbury, but he is recorded as a representa- 
tive at a great and general court or assembly 
for her Majesties I'rovince of Massachusetts 
Bay in New England held in Boston, Wednes-

Paul and Deborah ( W'illard ) Sares or Sears, 
and they lived in Horwich or ^'armouth. His 
father in his will made in 1717 mentions "my 
four grandchildren, the children of my son 
Eleazer Hamlin, deceased." He died in Yar- 
mouth in 1698, and his widow married, Sep- 
tember 30, 1706, Thomas Snow, of Harwich.

Graham, of Boston. 

(V) Major Eleazer (2), youngest son and 
seventh child of Benjamin and Anne (Mayo) 
Hamlin, was born in Billinggate, Plymouth

(first) in East Parish, Bridgewater, Massa-

cause of his large family at home he was re- 
tired with the rank of brevet major and that 
General Washington on bidding him farewell 
gave him $200 in Continental money. Four 
of his sons: Africa, Europe, America and

early settlers of Livermore. Oxford county, 
Maine, through a committee made up of Syl- 
vnnus Boardman, Ransom Norton, William 
Hood and Isaac Livermore, to settle in that 
place, at the time destitute of a physician, and 
he removed there the same vear and at once 



secured a large practice and a most estimable 
wife. He married December 4, 1797, Anna, 
daughter and sixth child of Deacon Fdijah

He died suddenly at his home in Paris Hill, 
February 2, 1829, and at the time six of their

dcr to furnish fur the maintenance of his 
mother and sisters. Wiiile engaged in farm- 
ing and teaching he found httle time to study 
law. He pubhshcd the Jc/'fcrsoiiiaii, a local 
Democratic paper, in partnership with Hora- 
tio King, but at the end of a year he sold 
his interest in the venture to his partner and 
took up the study of law in the office of 
General Samuel Fessendcn in Portland and 
he settled in the practice of law in Hampden, 
Penobscot county, in 1833. In 1835 he en- 
tered the arena of politics as the Democratic 
candidate for representative in the Maine legis- 
lature, and he was elected and continueil in 
office 1835-40, and for three terms, 1838-39-40, 
he was a speaker of the house, although but 
twenty-nine years of age when first elected 
.^peaker. In the fall of 1840 he was the un- 
.successful Democratic candidate for repre- 
sentative in the twenty-seventh United States 
congress, but he was the successful candidate 
in 1842 and 1844, serving in the twenty-eighth 
and twenty-ninth congresses, 1843-47. In con- 
gress he opposed the extension of slavery in 
his maiden speech, opposed the annexation of 
Texas, denounced the practice of duelling, and 
was the candidate of the anti-slavery Demo- 
crats for speaker. The Maine legislature in 
1846, after balloting six weeks, defeated him 
for United Slates senator by one vote, he being 
the candidate of the anti-slavery Democrats. 
In 1847 he was sent as a representative to the 
Maine legislature, and in May, 1848, when a 
vacancy occurred in the United States senate 
by the death of Senator John Fairfield, of 
Maine, as tilled temporarily by W. B. S. 
Moore, appointed by Governor Dana, Mr. 
Hamlin was elected by a majority of one vote 
to fill the vacancy, and in 1850 was re-elected 
after a contest in the legislative caucus for 
three months, for a full terms of six years. 
When Buchanan became the Democratic can- 
didate for president of the United States in 
1856, he left the parly, assisted in the forma- 
tion of the Republican party in Maine, ac- 
cepted the Republican nomination for govern- 
or of .Maine and was elected by 25.000 plu- 
rality. Thereupon lie resigned his seat in the 
United Stales senate, February 6, 1857, and 
was inaugurated as governor of Maine, but 
the same year was elected by the Republican 
legislature of Maine United States senator, 
and in l^'ebruary, 1857, resigned the governor- 
ship in oriler to take his seat in ihe United 
Stales senate, March 4, 1857. In i860 he was 
nominated ami elected vice-president of the 
United States on the ticket with Abraham 
Lincoln for president, and January i, 1861. he 



resigned his seat in the United States senate, 
and March 4, 1861, he took his seat as presi- 
dent of the United States senate and ably pre- 
sided over that body during the first four 
years of the eventful civil war. The wisdom 
of his party, in convention assembled in 1864, 
decided to give the vice-presidential nomina- 
tion to the south and President Lincoln on his 
second inauguration offered to Senator Ham- 
lin the portfolio of the United States treasury, 
which cabinet position he declined, and when 
Lincoln was assassinated, President Johnson 
made Senator Hamlin collector of the port of 
Boston, but he resigned the lucrative office in 
1866, as he was not in political accord with 
the president. The legislature of the state of 
Maine elected him to the United States senate 
in 1869 for the fourth time, and in 1875 for 
the fifth time. Having served in the United 
States senate for twenty-five years and as 
chairman of the committees on commerce, post- 
offices and post roads and of foreign affairs, 
he declined re-election to the senate in 1881, 
and President Garfield gave it to him to select 
his choice of three important missions, Ger- 
many, Italy and Spain, and Senator Hamlin 
went to Spain, but found it advisable to resign 
the mission in 1883. He was a founder of 
education, served as regent of the Smithsonian 
Institute, ex-officer 1861-65 and by appoint- 
ment 1870-82, and he was for a time dean of 
the board of regents. He was a trustee of

tion conferred on him the honorary degree of 
LL. D. in 1859.

Of the several distinct families of 
COBB New England origin bearing this 

surname, none is larger in point of 
numbers or more productive of distinguished 
men than that which claims as its progenitor 
Elder Henry Cobb, of IJarnstable, ^lassachu- 
setts. He is believed to have come from the 
county of Kent, in England ; and it has been 
claimed by one genealogist, apparently with- 
out documentary evidence, that he was con- 
nected with the landed family of the same sur- 
name which then had its seat at Cobbe Court 
in that county. There does seem reason, how- 
ever, to assert tiiat he became a Separatist in 
early youth, and was a member of the much 
persecuted congregation to which Rev. John 
Lothrop ministered in London before crossing 
the Atlantic. 

(1) Henry Cobb was living at Plymouth, 
Massachusetts, in 1632, at Scituate in 1633, 
and settled finally in Barnstable in 1639, where 
he died in 1679. In 1634 he and his wife 
were dismissed from the Plymouth church, and 
became, with others, original members of the 
church at Scituate. Here he was chosen a 
deacon in 1635, and the town historian re- 
cords that "he was a useful and valuable man." 
At Barnstable, whither he removed with his 
pastor, Rev. John Lothrop, he was senior 
deacon or ruling elder for forty-four years. 
He built two houses on his home lot of seven 
acres, the first apparently for temporary occu- 
pancy, the second of stone, as a place of 
refuge from the Indians, should they prove 
hostile. His "great lot" of sixty acres was 
especially adapted for grazing, and was sim- 
ply sufficient for the "one cowe and two goates 
to him in hand payd by Manasseth Kcmpton" 
in partial return for his lands at Scituate. He 
also had two lots in the "common field" oc- 
cupied for planting lands. He was a town 
officer, a member of its most important com- 
mittees and a deputy to the colony court in 
l645-47-52-59-C>o-f)i. He married (first) Pa- 
tience Hurst, who died in May, 1648; and 
(second) Sarah, daughter of Samuel Hinck- 
ley, whose death occurred shortly after his 
own. He had by the first marriage : John, 
James, Mary, Hannah, Patience, Gershom and 
Eliezer; by the second: Samuel, Jonathan. 



Sarah, Henry, Mehiiable, E.xperience besiiles 
two that died in infancy. 

(II) Jonathan, son of Elder Henry and 
Sarah (Hinckley) Cobb, was born April 10, 
1660, at Barnstable, Massachusetts. He mar- 
ried, March 1, 1682-83, Hope, widow of John 
Huckings, and daughter of Elder John Chip- 
man. In 1703 he removed to Middleborough, 
Massachusetts, and thence to Falmouth Neck, 
now Portland, Maine. His children were Sam- 
uel, Jonathan, Ebenezer, Joseph, Lydia and 
Gershom. 

(HI) Samuel, son of Jonathan and Hope 
(Cliipnian) Cobb, was born .April 6, 1686, at 
Barnstable, Massachusetts. He married Abi- 
gail Stuart, at Middleborough, Massachusetts, 
and removed to Maine in 171 7, and built the 
second house at Purpooduck, opposite Fal- 
mouth Neck. The following year, however, 
he removed and made his home on what is now 
Congress street, near the head of India street. 
He was a ship carpenter, and was for many 
years an active and influential man in the af- 
fairs of the town, having sustained the offices 
of clerk, treasurer and selectman. He died in 
1766. His children were : Chipman, Ebenezer, 
Samuel, Peter, Hope and Hannah. 

(I\') Samuel (2), son of Samuel (i) and 
Abigail (Stuart) Cobb, was born about 1720, 
and is referred to in Smith's Journal as Cap- 
tain Cobb, evidently to distinguish him from 
his father, who was generally known as 
Deacon Cobb. Like him he was largely en- 
gaged in shipbuilding both at Portland and at 
what is now Falmouth. He and his wife, 
whose maiden name is believed to be IngersoU, 
had two children : Samuel and William. 

(V) Samuel (3), son of Captain Samuel (2) 
Cobb, is the father of the Edward, Samuel and 
Francis Cobb who in February, 1806, con- 
veyed to Jonathan Moody "part of our honored 
Grandfather, Samuel Cobb, late of Falmouth, 
home estate e.xccpt one-half of tiie ship-yard 
given to our uncle William Cobb." They were 
joiners or iiousewrights, and united in otiier 
deeds of real estate in Portland. 

(\T) Francis Cobb, believed to be the Fran- 
cis mentioned above (the unfortunate destruc- 
tion of the probate records of Cumberland 
county prevents a more definite assertion), 
married Jane, daughter of Captain .Vmbrose 
and Fanny (Campbell) Snow, of Thoniaston. 
He was a ship joiner, and one of the first 
settlers at Cherryfield, Maine. He himself 
died at Boston, in 1817. .\mong his chiltlren 
were Mary and Francis.

Jane (Snow) Lobb, was born l''chriuii) 23, 
1818, at Chcrrylicld, Maine, ilis father died 
a few weeks previous, leaving the family in 
narrow circumstances. The mother succeeded, 
however, in bringing up the children with the 
ordinary comforts and advantages of the time 
and place. After obtaining a common school 
education the youngest son was for two years 
in the family and store of Mr. Hawley, a mer- 
chant at Cherryticld, and then for a year with 
Mr. Morse, of Machias. The latter's kindness 
he never forgot, and would often recall the 
suit of broadcloth and the fur hat which he 
received from him, despite his youth. In Au- 
gust, 1834, he became a clerk in the store of 
his uncle, Thomas A. Snow, at Thomaston, 
Maine, where he remained nearly four years. 
At this period Rockland was a small village 
known as East Thomaston. Here, a youth 
of only twenty, Mr. Cobb began business 
for himself in March, 1838, in a small store on 
the corner of Maine and Limerick streets. He 
soon sold out, and, entering into copartner- 
ship with L K. Kimball, conducted for five 
years a general merchandise store, carrying 
the largest stock of goods in the place. He 
continued in the same line of business for 
twenty years, sometiines in partnership with 
others, sometimes alone. Meanwhile Rockland 
had been growing rapidly. It was set off from 
Thomaston in 1848, and became a city in 1850. 
Mr. Cobb was not only enterprising in busi- 
ness, but displayed wonderfully accurate judg- 
ments in investments. His ventures generally 
proved profitable and he accumulated property 
rapidly. His firm began to engage in the man- 
ufacture of lime and in shipbuilding. In 1859 
the cutting of granite was added to its enter- 
prises, and quarries were opened at Spruce 
Head. In 1871 the Bodwell Granite Com- 
pany was formed, and Mr. Cobb became its 
treasurer. This company obtained valuable 
government contracts and also did a lucrative 
general business. In 1870 the Cobb Lime 
Company was formed, composed of the largest 
firms then engaged in the lime business. Mr. 
Cobb was the first president and held this 
office till his death. As early as 1845 he built 
his first vessel, the "Mary Langdon," which 
was still afloat and owned by him at the time 
of his decease. Under the firm name of Cobb, 
Butler & Company he was largely interested 
in the building, repairing and sailing of ves- 
sels. He was also president of the Rockland 
Savings Bank, a director in the Rockland 
National Bank and the Knox and Lincoln 
railroad. In politics he was a Republican, ami 
naturally exercised great influence. He was 



not, however, active in practical politics, and 
rarely would accept office for himself. He 
represented Rockland in the state legislature 
of i860 and i86i, served as city councilman 
in 1865, as alderman in 1866-67-68 and 1870. 
He was a delegate to the Republican national 
conventions in 1876, 1880 and 1884, and a 
presidential elector in 1876. As a leader in 
great corporations and a potential factor in 
the political part}' dominant in the state, he 
was often the target for spirited if not bitter 
attacks, but no man ever breathed an aspersion 
or a suspicion against his personal character 
for integrity and honor. All accorded him the 
noble qualities, the intellectual force, and the 
sturdy manhood which his long life in the 
community had revealed. He died of paraly- 
sis, at Portland, Maine, December 2, 1890. 

Mr. Cobb married, October 16, 1839, ^^ 
Thomaston, JNIaine, Martha J., daughter of 
Dr. Chauncey C. and Lovisa (MillerJ Chand- 
ler, who was born at Belfast, April 2, 1820, 
and died at Rockland, May 23, 1895. They 
had eleven children : Mary A. C, widow of 
E. P. Norton; Captain Frank K., who com- 
manded the bark "Jennie Cobb," and was lost 
at sea on its first vo_\age ; Lovisa H., wife of 
James S. Hanley, of San P'rancisco; Alaria F., 
wife of Louis T. Snow, of San Francisco; 
Charles W. S., of St. Louis ; Jennie W., wife of 
A. W. Butler, of Rockland ; Maynard S., who 
died in infancy ; William T., mentioned be- 
low ; Martha F., who died February 3, 1883; 
Nathan P., and Lucius Edward, both of Rock- 
land. 

(VTII) William Titcomb, son of Francis 
and Martha J. (Chandler) Cobb, was born 
July 23, 1857, at Rockland, Maine. He re- 
ceived his early education in the public schools 
of his native city, graduating at its high school 
in 1873. He pursued his college course at 
Bowdoin, where, though one of the youngest 
members of the class, he won reputation for 
excellence in English composition and was 
an editor of the undergraduate journal. Fol- 
lowing his graduation in 1877 he studied at 
the Universities of Leipsic and Berlin for two 
years. Returning to America he was a student 
at the Harvard Law School for a year, con- 
tinued his law studies with Messrs. Rice and 
Hall, of Rockland, and was admitted to the 
bar in December, 1880. He did not, however, 
engage in practice, preferring a business life, 
and entered at once the firm of Cobb, Wight 6: 
Company, wholesale and retail grocers. Sub- 
sequently he formed a partnership with his 
father for the manufacture of lime at Rock- 
land ; and, upon the latter's death, became 



STATE OF MAIXE. 



president of the Cobb Lime Company, a po- 
sition he hckl till the sale of this properly to 
the Rocklanil-Rockport Lime Company in 
1900. He is director in the Rt)cklan(l Xatioiial 
Bank, the Rockland Trust Company, the Cam- 
den and Rockland Water Company, and the 
Rockland, Thomaston & Camden Street Rail- 
way. He is a trustee of his alma mater, JjOW- 
doin College, where in his undergraduate days 
he received from his classmates the "wooden 
spoon," the coveted emblem of the most popu- 
lar man. 

In 1889-90, Mr. Cobb served as a member 
of the executive council, and in 1904 was 
chosen governor of Maine. He was reelected 
in iyo6 for a second term of two years. What- 
ever may have been said in the bitterness of 
political contests during the election period, 
the citizens of Maine now agree that not for 
half a centur) has any governor stood so 
strongly and so consistently for the enforce- 
ment of law, regardless of personal or party 
interests. His administration witnessed the 
passing of legislation enabling the state to pre- 
vent open nullification of its prohibitory law 
by local officials; the adoption of the referen- 
dum: the .substitution of salaries in places of 
fees in the case of most officials, and the es- 
tablishment of a state auditor. 

Governor Cobb married, June 14, 1S82, 
Lucy Callie, oulv daughter of Dr. William A. 
and Mary .\. (Tillsonj Banks, of Rockland. 
Their two children are Martha Banks and 
Anna West Cobb. Dr. Banks, a native of 
East Livermore, graduated at JefTerson ]\Ied- 
ical College in 1846, was commissioned sur- 
geon of the Fourth JNlaine Infantry in 1861. 
and practiced his profession at Rockland, 
where he died in 1893. He was a descendant 
of the emigrant ancestor Richard Bankes, a 
prominent citizen of York, ?ilaine. where he 
was a provincial councillor in 1651-52. select- 
man for seven years, trial justice in 1669, 1672 
and 1679, and is believed to have perished in 
the Indian massacre of January 25, 1692. 

The sources from which names are 
FRYE derived and the circumstances 

which dictated the taking of them 
are so numerous and varied as to be beyond 
all knowledge, y>.t careful study and prolonged 
search have discovcre<l the origin of a multi- 
tude of them. Writers have classified sur- 
names from their origins as baptismal, local, 
official, occupative and sobriquet. Not a few 
names of both ancient and modern times are 
expressive of the condition of tbe persons who 



bore them. Among primitive and uncivilized 
nations slavery has generally been a recog- 
nized institution. Our Sa.xon ancestors cher- 
ished it, and the last slave was not liberated 
in Britain until after surnames were adopted. 
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when 
men had but one name, and a nickname was 
added to designate more closely the person re- 
ferred to, a slave might be mentioned as "Ive 
De Bond," or "Richard le Bond," while a man 
who had been born free, though of humble 
circumstances, would be anxious to preserve 
himself from a doubtful or suspected position 
by such a name as "Walter le Free," or "John 
le Freeman." In our "Fryes," a sobriquet that 
has acquired much honor of late years and 
represented in the mediaeval rolls by such en- 
tries as "Thomas le Frye," or "Walter le 
Frie," we have but an absolute rendering of 
"free." 

Among the early New England families of 
English origin this has been more conspicu- 
ously identified with the state of Maine than 
with its original home in Massachusetts. It 
has furnished one of the most distinguished 
members of the United States senate, and 
many useful and worthy citizens in various 
localities. Its origin is directly traced to Eng- 
land, and its establishment in New England 
was early. 

(I) John Frye, born i6oi, was a resident of 
Bassing, Hants, England. In May, 1638, he 
sailed from Southampton in the ship "Bevis," 
of Hampton, commanded by Robert Eaton, 
and w^as an early settler in Newbury, Massa- 
chusetts. In 1645 '>^ removed thence to An- 
dover, Massachusetts, where he was a very 
active citizen up to the end of his life, and 
where lie died November 9, 1693, at the age 
of ninety-two years and seven months. His 
wife Ann died at Andover, October 22, 1680. 
Their children were: John, Benjamin, Sam- 
uel, James, Elizabeth and Susan. 

(II) Samuel, third son and child of John 
and Ann Frye, was born about 1650, in An- 
dover, Massachusetts, where he passed his life 
and died May 9, 1725. He married, Novem- 
ber 20, 1671, Mary, daughter of John .Aslett 
(or Asledee). She survived her husband 
about twelve years, dying in 1747. John 
Aslett, or .Asledee, of Newbury and .Andover, 
was born about 1614, and died June 6, 1771. 
He married, October 8, 1648, Rebecca Ayer, 
daughter of John Aver. Their children were : 
John, Samuel, Mary, Phoebe, Hannah, Ebe- 
nezer, Nathan, Deborah, Samuel and Benja- 
min. Their third child and daughter, Mary,

became tlic wife i>f Samuel Frye ; she was 
born April J4, 1654, and died .-\u;;ust 12. 

1747- 

(III) John (2), eldest child of Samuel and 
Mary (Aslelt or Asictlee) Frye, was born 
September 16, 1672, in Andover, and died in 
that town, April 7, 1737. He married, No- 
vember I, 1694, Tabitha, daughter of Thom- 
as and Elizabeth Farnum, who died May 17, 
1775, in her seventy-tilth year. Their chil- 
dren were: John (died young), Isaac, Joshua, 
Abiel, Mehitabel, .Anne (died young), Joseph, 
Samuel, Anne, John, Tabitha and Hannah. 

(IV) Joseph, fourth son and eighth child 
of John (2) and Tabitha (Farnum) Frye, 
was born in April, 171 1, in Andover and re- 
sided in that town, where he was a very prom- 
inent citizen. He served as justice of the 
peace, representative in the general court and 
was generally active in the affairs of the 
town. He served in the war of 1755 and par- 
ticipated in the siege of Louisburg. In the 
war of 1757 he was colonel of a regiment at 
the capture of Fort William Henry by Mont- 
■calm. He was promised protection by La- 
corne, who had great influence among the 
savages and whose countrymen had been hu- 
manely treated by Colonel Frye in Nova Sco- 
tia. He expressed great gratitude and pre- 
tended that he desired to make returns in this 
way, promising that neither he nor any of the 
Massachusetts troops should receive injury 
from the Indians. This promise was in no- 
wise fulfilled, and Colonel Frye was plundered 
and stripped of his clothes and led into the 
woods by an Indian, who intended to dispatch 
him. On arriving at a secluded spot the colo- 
nel made a desperate effort to preserve his life, 
and with no other arms than those which na- 
ture gave him, he overpowered and killed the 
Indian and by rapid flight in a thick woods 
eluded his captors, and after several days of 
suffering in the wilderness he arrived at Fort 
Edward. He was appointed major-general, 
June 21, 1775, by the provincial congress and 
continued a short time with the troops at 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the revolution- 
ary war. In recognition of his military ser- 
vice he was granted a township of land by the 
general court of Massachusetts, which he se- 
lected in a very lonely locality in the present 
state of Maine, and this tow^n is still known 
as Fryeburg. He was a land surveyor among 
•other accomplishments, and was enabled to 
secure a verv fine location. His descendants 
are still very nutnerous in that locality and 
■other sections of the state of Maine. He mar- 
ried, March 20, 1733, Mehitable Poore. and 



they were the parents of: Joseph (died 

young), SanuR-l, Mehitable (died young), Me- 
hitable (died young) MeliilaMe, Joseph, Ta- 
bitha, Hannah, Richard, Nathan and Samuel. 

(V) Captain Joseph (2), third son and 
si.xth child of General Joseph ( 1 ) Frye, was 
born July 10, 1743, in Andover, and passed 
most of his life in Fryeburg, Maine. His 
children were: Joseph, Mary, Mehitable, John, 
Nancy, Dean, Sarah, William and Sophia. 

(\T) Dean, third son of Captain Joseph 
(2) Frye, was born May 25, 1775. 

(\TI) Colonel John M., son of Dean Frye, 
was born November 28, 1802, in Westbrook, 
Maine, and settled in Lewiston, same state, 
where he was many years identified with man- 
ufacturing, and was a prominent and public- 
spirited citizen. He was colonel of the local 
militia, and a popular and efficient officer. For 
thirty-five years he served the town as clerk, 
was selectman in 1831-32-33, and moderator 
in 1840-41-42-43-44. He was town treasurer 
in 1849-50-51-52-53-54 and 1858-59-60-61-62. 
In 1841 he was elected a member of the state 
senate and was a member of the council in 
1861. Fie married Alice, daughter of David 
Davis, of Lewiston, who was a Friend and 
an elder in his church. She was born May 
ID, 1809, died November, 1871. Colonel 
Frye and wife were the parents of Mary D., 
Sarah, Addie, a child wdio died in infancy, 
William Pierce, and Dr. Albert S., who died 
in early manhood. 

(VIII) William Pierce, only surviving son 
of Colonel John M. and Alice (Davis) Frye, 
was born September 2, 1831, in Lewiston, 
Maine, and received his primary education in 
the public schools, preparing for college at 
Lewiston Falls Academy. Entering Bowdoin 
College, he was graduated from that institu- 
tion in the class of 1850 and immediately went 
to Rockland, where he began the study of 
law in the office of Lowell & Foster. Later 
he pursued his legal studies with Hon. William 
Pitt Fessenden, at Portland, and was ad- 
mitted to the bar in October, 1852. He at 
once engaged in practice at Rockland, but was 
destined soon to take a prominent place in the 
conduct of public affairs. In 1855 h^ ■"£" 
moved to Lewiston and rapidly built up a legal 
business through his superior ability and care- 
ful attention to the interests of his clientele. 
A man of his talents and broad mental makeup 
could not be long confined to private affairs, 
and he soon came to be recognized as a power 
in public concerns. He was elected to the 
state legislature in 1861-62 and again in 1S67. 
In the latter and preceding years he was 



i6 



STATE OF MAINE. 



mayor of Lewiston, and was attorney-general 
of the state in 1867-68-69. He was a presi- 
dential elector in 1864, and was a delegate to 
the National Republican conventions of 1872- 
76-80 ; was elected chairman of the National 
Republican executive committee in the same 
years, and was made chairman of the Repub- 
lican state committee upon the resignation of 
James G. Blaine in 1881. He was elected 
representative in the United States congress, 
serving through the forty-second, forty-third, 
forty-fourth, forty-fifth, forty-sixth and forty- 
seventh congresses. He was elected to the 
United States senate, IMarch 15, 1881, to fill 
the unexpired term of James G. Blaine, who 
resigned to become national secretary of state. 
Mr. Frye took his seat three days after elec- 
tion, and has filled the position continuously 
since, by repeated elections. He was elected 
president pro tempore of the senate, February 
7, 1896, March 7, 1901, December 5, 1907, and 
presided as vice-president of senate for six 
years ; first upon the death of Garret A. Ho- 
bart and second upon the death of President 
McKinley. He was a member of the commis- 
sion which met in Paris in September, 1898, 
to adjust terms of peace between the United 
States and Spain, and has been a member of 
nearly all important committees, especially 
those relating to New England coast matters, 
was a member of the committee on rules for 
the senate and is the author of nearly all the 
rules now governing that body and also house. 
Senator Frye reported the bill governing the 
Geneva award and, though he was opposed 
by all the large insurance companies, won 
out and secured direct payment of the money 
to those entitled to it. For many years he 
has been chairman of various important com- 
mittees of congress, including those on ways 
and means, commerce, judiciary, foreign re- 
lations, and served three times on the Canadian 
fisheries commission, winning the contest with 
Canada and breaking up the old treaty and es- 
tablishing that now in force. Senator Frye 
was instrumental in bringing about the annex- 
ation of Hawaii, and in fact in all important 
legislation for more than a quarter of a cen- 
tury. His continuous service is longer than 
any other man in congress, and he is yet active 
in the service of his country, respected and 
honored by his colleagues as well as by the 
entire nation. No other wields a greater in- 
fluence. His democratic manners and straight- 
forward methods endear him to all lovers of 
justice and liberty. He was elected a trustee 
of Bowdoin College in 1880, received the de- 
gree of Doctor of Laws from Bates College 



the following year and from his alma mater 
in 1889. 

Senator Frye married, February 29, 1853, 
Caroline F., daughter of Captain Archibald 
and Angelica (Branton) Spear, of Rockland.

John Fuller, ancestor of Ed- 
FULLER ward Fuller, and his brother, 

Dr. Samuel Fuller, both of 
whom came on the "Mayflower," and of Cap- 
tain Matthew Fuller, who came later to Ply- 
mouth, lived in the parish of Redenhall with 
Harleston, in nearly the center of the hundred 
of Earsham. county Norfolk, England. Wort- 
well, an adjacent parish, shares in the parish 
church, through which the division line passes. 
He was born probably as early as 1500 and 
died in 1558-59. There were living in Reden- 
hall in 1482 and 1488 John and William Ful- 
ler, one of whom was doubtless father of John 
Fuller (i), whose will was dated February 4, 
1558-59, and proved May 12, 1559, bequeath- 
ing to his son John lands in Redenhall and 
Wortwell : also to son Robert and daughter 
Alice (Ales) ; and to Stephen and Frances 
Sadd. Children: i. John; mentioned below. 
2. Alice. 3. Robert, mentioned below. 

(H) John (2), son of John (i) Fuller, 
lived at Redenhall. His will is dated January 
29, 1598-99, and proved May 8, 1599, be- 
queathing to wife Ann ; sons Thomas, the

baptized January 20, 1619, settled at Dedham, 
Massachusetts. 8. William, the elder, one of 
the older children, died before his father. 9. 
Thomas, the younger. Perhaps others. There 
is no doubt that there were two children, 
adults at the same time, named \\'illiam and 
two also named Thomas. This perplexing cus- 
tom of having two children of the same name, 
both living, was not at all uncommon. 

(H) Robert, son of John (i) Fuller, lived 
at Redenhall. He was a yeoman. His will 
was dated May 19, 1614, and proved May 31, 
1614, by the widow and June 16, 1614, by

Robert huUer may have been of another of 
the same name. The will of Robert Fuller, 
butcher, mentions those of the American fam- 
ilies, however. 

(HI) John (3), son of Robert F'uUer, was 
baptized at Redenliall, .March 15, 1578-79, or 
March 25, 1582. and died in 1608, before his

tized after his father died, June 30, 1C09. 

(IV) Captain Matthew, son of John (3) 
Fuller, was baptized in Redenhall, England, 
October 16, 1C03. He came to Plymouth, 
where his two uncles, Edward and Dr. Sam- 
uel, had preceded him, and until recently it 
was supposed that he was a son of Edward. 
The first record of him at Plymouth was Oc- 
tober 26, 1640, when he sold to Andrew Ring 
for one cow, a calf and two goats a piece of 
land at Plymouth and six acres in the new 
field, lately bought of John Gregory. In later 
years he was accounted to be "one of the 
first born of the colony" and had land assigned 
him by virtue of his primogeniture. It was 
the law that where no children were born to 
a family in this country, the right of drawing 
land was given to the eldest son, though he 
were born in the old country. Nevertheless he 
was classed among ''the first born of the col- 
ony." In 1642 he was granted ten acres near 
the farm of Thurston Clark in Plymouth, and 
in the same year served as a juryman. He 
applied for admission as a freeman September 
7, 1642, but was not allowed to qualify until 
June 7, 1653. He was one of the leading mili- 
tary men of the colony. When the first com- 
pany was organized under command of Cap- 
tain Myles Stantlish in 1643 h^ was appointed 
sergeant and made lieutenant in September, 
1652. He was a lieutenant June 20, 1654, 
under Captain Standish, in command of fifty 
men organized for the proposed expedition 
against the Dutch of New Amsterdam, later 
called New York. The company was ordered 
to rendezvous at Sandwich, Plymouth colony, 
June 29, to embark from Mahanet in the 
barque "Adventure," owned by Captain Sam- 
uel Mayo, of Barnstable, and to join the other 
English colonial forces; but on June 2^ news 
was received that peace was declared between 
England and Holland and preparations for 
war ceased. Fuller was elected to the council 
of war October 2, 1658, and was made chair- 
man in 1671. In that year also he was lieu- 
tenant of the colonial forces in the expedition

against the Indians of Saconet. Fuller was a 
physician by profession and had a good stand- 
ing as shown by his appointment December 
17, 1673, as surgeon-general of the Plymouth 
Colony troops and also of the Massachusetts 
Bay troops. He served as captain of the com- 
pany in King Philip's war and took a dis- 
tinguishing part. He was deputy to the gen- 
eral court as early as 1653. He lived first at 
Plymouth, then at Scituate, where he was ad- 
mitted to the church by letter from Plymouth 
church, and finally at Barnstable, where he was 
the first regular physician. His son John and 
some of his grandsons followed him in his 
profession, which he doubtless learned of his 
uncle, Dr. Samuel, and in turn taught to his 
son. He and his cousin lived side by side on 
Scorton Neck, which was bought of the Se- 
cunke (Seeconk) Indians by Barnstable and 
Sandwich. The west end of the Fuller farm 
formed the town line between Sandwich and 
Barnstable. A dispute as to this boundary 
line caused a lawsuit, which was eventually 
compromised, the Fullers relinquishing their 
claim to certain lands granted by Barnstable 
October 3, 1672, and the town of Sandwich 
conceding to the Fullers certain rights of way 
with the privilege of cutting fence stuiT in 
Sandwich. Captain Fuller had land granted 
at Suckennesset, now Falmouth, and in the 
"Major's Purchase," Middleborough, as "first- 
born" rights. He was a man of sound judg- 
ment, good understanding and courage. He 
was faithful to his trusts, liberal in politics and 
tolerant in religion. In fact he was too toler- 
ant for his day and too frank in his speech to 
avoid trouble. He was indignant at the pro- 
secution of the Quakers, and was indicted for 
saying "the law enacted about minister's main- 
tenance was a wicked and devilish law and 
that the devil sat at the stone when it was 
enacted." He admitted that he used the words, 
and was fined fifty shillings. Yet he held the 
confidence of the people and received further 
honors and high office afterward. He died at 
Barnstable in 1678. He bequeathed in his will, 
dated July 25, proved October 30, 167S, to 
his wife Frances, to grandchild Shubael, son 
of Ralph Jones; to son John, and to Thomas, 
Jabez, Timothy, Matthias and Samuel, sons of 
his deceased son Samuel; to Elizabeth, wife 
of Moses Rowdey, and Anne, wife of son 
Samuel ; to Bethiah, wife of son John ; to 
grandchild Sarah Rowley, Jedediah Jones and 
all the rest. Also to Robert Marshall, "the 
Scotchman." Children: i. Mary, married, 
April 17, 1650, Ralph Jones. 2. Elizabeth,

(V) Lieutenant Samuel, son of Captain 
Matthew Fuller, was born in England. He 
was a prominent citizen and soldier. In 1670 
he served on a committee of Plymouth colony 
to assess damages for injury to the cattle of 
the Indians. He held various town offices. 
He was lieutenant of the Barnstable company 
in King Philip's war and was killed in battle 
at Rehoboth, Massachusetts, August 15, 1675. 
By a singular coincidence another Samuel 
Fuller, the son of Robert Fuller, of Salem, 
was killed at Rehoboth, March 25, 1675, but a 

few months before. He married Mary .

Zebulon King's company, Lieutenant Colonel 
John Brook's regiment (the Seventh Ply- 
mouth). He was court-martialed on the 
charge of disobeying orders and using inso- 
lent language, and was sentenced to be re- 
duced, but he must have been restored to his 
rank as sergeant almost immediately. He was 
certainly sergeant in 1781-82, in Captain 
King's company. Lieutenant John Brooks' reg- 
iment. He was court-martialed the second 
time for overstaying his furlough ten hours, 
but he proved his tardiness was due to lame- 
ness and unavoidable, and was acquitted. The 
records give his age in 1781-82 as twenty 
years, also as twenty-one; his height as six 
feet; complexion dark (also given as brown) ; 
his occupation, farmer; his birthplace and resi- 
dence, JMiddleborough. He was again court- 
martialed March i, 1782, on the charge of 
overstaying his leave for three days, but was 
again acquitted. He was discharged June 13, 
1783, his term of enlistment having expired, by 
General Washington himself, as stated in the 
Massachusetts archives. He was living in 
Warren (now Maine) in 1801, and was de- 
clared entitled according to the resolves of 
March 14, 1801, and June 19, 1801, to gratui- 
ties, etc., from the state. He had a record of 
long and hard service from the time he could 
enter the army until the close of the war. He 
removed, after the revolution, to Maine, and 
studied for the ministry in the Baptist denomi- 
nation. He was ordained an evangelist at

ren and continued in that pastorate the re- 
mainder of his life, a period of twenty years.

not conspicuous, furnished an excellent ex- 
ample of the success that follows in the train 
of the old-fashioned New England attribute?

(HI) Edward Fuller, son of 
FULLER Robert Fuller (2), was baptized 
.September 4, 1575, at Reden- 
hall, county Norfolk, England ; came in the 
"Mayflower" to Plymouth with the Pilgrims 
in 1620, with his famous brother, Dr, Samuel 
Fuller, and was one of the signers of the 
compact on board the ship before landing. He 
probably joined the "Mayflower" company at 
Southampton, England. Both he and his wife 
died early in 1621, leaving a son Samuel, men- 
tioned below. 

(I\') Samuel, son of Edward Fuller, came 
in the "Mayflower" to New England with his 
parents, who died and left him an orphan. He 
went to live with his uncle, Dr. Samuel Ful- 
ler, who was the first physician in the country 
He had three shares in the division of land in 
1624, out of respect to his father and mother. 
He was the executor of his uncle's will in 
1633. He was admitted a freeman in 1634. 
He removed from Plymouth to Scituate, where 
he married, April 8, 1635, Jane Lothrop, 
daughter of Rev, John Lothrop. He joined 
the church at Scituate by letter from Ply- 
mouth, November 7, 1636, and built in the 
same year the fifteenth house in Scituate, on 
Greenfield street, the first lot abutting on Kent 
street. He owned twenty acres in the east 
part of Bell House Neck. He was a resi-

dent of Barnstable as early as 1641, accord- 
ing to the church records, lie was certainly 
an inhabitant there January 1, i'')44, and his 
cousin Matthew came later. The town of 
Barnstable bought of the Secunke Indians 
land called Scorton or Sandy Neck, set off the 
arable land, and reserved the rest for common 
!and, and afterward divided it. The Fuller 
cousins lived on this land. Samuel F'uller also 
bought a meadow of his cousin Matthew, which 
had previonsly been owned by Major John 
Freeman, and mcadowland of Samuel House. 
He resided in the northwest angle of Barn- 
stable, in a secluded spot, where travcllcr.s sel- 
dom passed. He was seldom in public life. 
He was constable of Scituate in 1641, and

before thev had started. Matthew Fuller was 



a prominent Indian fighter and served in King 
Philip's war ; he was de|)uty to the general 
court in 1653. The inventory of Samuel Ful- 
ler's estate was filed December 29, 1691, and

the brothers who came from Barnstable about 
the close of the revolution, of whom two set- 
tled in Kennebec county. Chief Justice Ful- 
ler is a descendant of one of them. Seth Ful-

ing there all his active life. He married De- 
liverance Jones, daughter of Ephraim and Pa- 
tience Jones, who came also from Barnstable, 
descended from one of the oldest and best 
known families of that town. Benjamin Ful- 
ler died in 1815 in Fairfield and his wife sev- 
eral years later. Children, born in Fairfield :

1806, mentioned below. 3. Abigail Nye, mar- 
ried Franklin Blackwell, of Winslow, Maine. 
4. Warren, who was a farmer at Fairfield. 

(X) John Jones, son of Benjamin Fuller, 
was born in Fairfield, July 22, 1806. He was 
reared on his father's farm and received a 
rather meagre schooling, but through his own 
efforts became well educated, acquiring a broad 
knowledge of the world and of literature. His 
father died when he was only nine years old, 
and from that time he did his share of the 
toil and drudgery on the farm. When he was 
twenty years old he engaged in trading in 
farm produce, finding a market in Bangor. 
Later he engaged in the hotel business and 
was for a time proprietor of the old Fairfield 
House, and in partnership with Colonel Eben 
Lawrence, under the firm name of Lawrence, 
Pratt & Company, general merchants. After 
many years of prosperous business in Fair- 
field he removed, in 1842, to Augusta, where 
he opened a retail grocery store with con- 
tinued success, and continued a popular and 
prosperous merchant during his active life. In 
1864 he disposed of the business to his son, 
James E., and retired. He was associated in 
the lumber business for a number of years 
with his father-in-law, James Rogers. In poli- 
tics he was a Democrat ; in religion a member 
of the Methodist Episcopal church. He died 
in 1886. He married, December 24, 1840, 
Deborah Rogers, born in Peru, Clinton county, 
New York, September 8, 1815, daughter of 
James Jr. and Sarah (Keese) Rogers, and 
granddaughter of James Rogers, who went 
from Marshfield, Massachusetts, to New York, 
descendant of John Rogers, the Pilgrim an- 
cestor. Children: i. Abbie, born November 
10, 1841, married Rev. Perry Chandler, now 
a resident of Oregon ; children : Perry F. and 
Webster A. Chandler. 2. James Edward, born 
December 17, 1844, mentioned below. 3. John 
Martin, born December 11, 1846, died aged 
eighteen years. 5. Samuel Rogers, born 1853, 
engaged for some years in the book business in 
Augusta, Maine ; now living in the south ; 
married Frances Chick; children: Plarry, Em- 
ma (twin), Grace (twin), Thaddeus C, James 
E. 

(XI) James Edward, son of John Jones Ful- 



ler, was born December 17, 1844, at Augusta, 
Maine. He was educated in the common 
schools of Augusta, and then entered upon 
his business career as clerk in his father's store. 
In 1864 he succeeded his father as proprietor 
of the grocery store and he conducted it suc- 
cessfully to 1902, when he devoted his atten- 
tion exclusively to the wholesale business in 
partnership with his son John. At first the 
firm name was the Fuller Wholesale Grocery 
and Grain Company, later the Fuller, Halloway 
Grocery Company, and a very large and flour- 
ishing business has been established. Mr. Ful- 
ler stands high in the business world antl has 
the respect and confidence of all who know 
him. Few business men in Augusta have been 
in business there for a longer time, thirty- 
eight years, and few are better known or more 
enterprising and successful. Mr. Fuller is a 
Democrat in politics and has served his party 
and city in various positions of trust and hon- 
or. He was city treasurer in 1903 and has 
been a member of the common council. He is 
an active and consistent member of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal church and has been chairman 
of its board of trustees for a number of years. 
He married, March 21, 1867, Emily How- 
ard, born in Sidney, Maine, daughter of Col- 
umbus and Lucy (Hammond) Howard, grand- 
daughter of Major Ruel Howard, who was a 
native of Bridgewater, Massachusetts. (See 
sketch of the Howard family herewith.) Chil- 
dren of James Edward and Emily Fuller: i. 
Florence, born July 21, 1868, married, April 
27, 1895, Thomas C. Ingraham; children: 
James Fuller, Deborah, Horace and Howard 
Ingraham. 2. John H., born December 10, 
1869, member of father's firm; married Fran- 
ces Elliott, of Elmira, New York. 3. Edith 
M., born January 18, 1879, niarried Henry T. 
Elmore, of Elmira, New York. 4. James Mar- 
tin, born July 26, 1882, died May 15, 1905. 



Melville Weston Fuller, Chief 
FULLER Justice of the L'nited States, 

traces his descent in unbroken 
line from two of the most important families 
of the Plymouth Colony, and numbers among 
his forbears lawyers and jurists of marked 
ability. (The ancestry down to Matthew 
(VI) is contained in previous pages.) 

(VI) Matthew, son of Samuel and 
Ann (Fuller) Fuller, was born in Barnstable, 
Massachusetts, in 1659, and died in Colches- 
ter, Connecticut, before 1744. He settled in 
Colchester in 1713, and was baptized at the 
First Church there December 12, 1734. He 
married, February 25, 1692, Patience Young,

(\'ll) Young, son of Matthew and I'atience 
(Young) Fuller, was born in Barnstable, Mas- 
sachusetts, in 1708. He was about five years 
old when his parents removed to that part of 
Windsor, Connecticut, which now is Elling- 
ton, and after 1767 he made his home with 
the family of his son Joshua, in Ludlow, where 
he died in 1796. The house in which his 
corpse was laid took fire, his body being re- 
moved to a neighbor's. He married, April 23, 
1730, Jerusha, daughter of Jonathan and 
Bridget (Brockv^-ay) Beebe, of East Haddam, 
Connecticut. Children: i. John, born Sep-

(\'ni) Caleb, son of Young and Jerusha 
(Beebe) Fuller, was born in Colchester, Con- 
necticut, in 1735. He removed to Ellington in 
1747. He graduated from Yale College in 
1758, and received the degree of A. M. in 
1762. He is called Deacon in some records, 
and Reverend in others. He married, Octo- 
ber 28. 1762, Hannah \\'eld, (laughter of Rev. 
Habijah Weld, the famous minister who 
preached at Attleboro, Massachusetts, for 
fifty-five years. Rev. Habijah Weld was son 
of Rev. Thomas Weld, the first minister of 
Dunstable, and great-grandson of Rev. Thom- 
as Weld, the first minister of Ro.xbury, Mas- 
sachusetts. Caleb Fuller removed in 1771 to 
Middletown, Connecticut, and in 1790 to Han- 
over, New Hampshire, where he died .August 
20, 1815. 

(IX) Captain Henry Weld P\iller, son of 
Caleb and Hannah (Weld) Fuller, w^as born 
in Middletown, Connecticut. January i, 1783, 
and died January 29, 1841. Pie graduated 
from Dartmouth College in 1801. studied for 
the legal profession, and in 1803 settled for 
practice in Augusta, ^Nlaine. He was county 
attorney in 1826, and judge of probate for 
Kennebec county from 1828 until the time of 
his death (very suddenly) in Boston, January 
29, 1841. He married, January 7, 1806, Esther 
Gould, daughter of Captain Benjamin Gould, 
of Newburyport, Massachusetts. Captain 
Gould led a company of thirty minute-men 
from Topsfield to Lexington, on the alarm of 



.\pril 19, 1775, and m that battle received a 
wound which left ujxjn his cheek a scar for 
life; he was commissioned captain in the Con- 
tinental army, and after the battle of liunkcr 
Hill was the last man to cross Charleslown 
Neck on the retreat ; and he was i)resent at 
the battles of White I'lains, Bennington and 
Stillwater, and commanded the main guard at 
West Point, when .\riiold lied after the cap- 
ture of Major .Andre. Among Captain Gould's 
children was Benjamin Aplithorp, a distin- 
guished educator, who was head master of the 
Boston Latin School (1814-28) and made it 
the most famous pre] aratory school in the 
United States, and was author of Latin text- 
books and classic translations from that lan- 
guage. A daughter of Captain Gould, Han- 
nah Flagg Gould, was a poetess of note in her 
day. Fier volume, "Hymns and Poems for 
Children," is yet prized in many homes. 

(X) F"rederick .Augustus, son of Captain 
Henry Weld and Esther (Gould) Fuller, was 
born October 5, 1806. He read law under 
his father, was admited to the bar, and prac- 
ticed at .Augusta and Orono, Maine. He was 
chairman of the board of county commissioners 
of Penobscot county. He died January 29, 
1841. He married, May 17, 1830, Catherine 
Martin, daughter of Nathan and Pauline 
(Bass) Cony. Her father was the second 
Chief Justice of Maine, and her maternal 
grandfather, Daniel Cimy, was also a jurist of 
note. 

(XI) Chief Justice Melville We.ston Fuller, 
son of Frederick Augustus and Catherine 
(Weston) Fuller, was born in .Augusta, Maine, 
February 11, 1833. He was afforded excellent 
educational advantages. He was prepared for 
college at .Augusta and went to Bowdoin Col- 
lege in 1849, and from which he was graduated 
in 1853, afterward entering the Dane Law 
School of Harvard University, and receiving 
his degree of Bachelor of Laws in 1855. He 
entered upon practice in Augusta, and while 
enduring the wait for clients which marks the 
beginning of every lawyer, employed his spare 
time in newspaper work — a circumstance to 
which is doubtless due somewhat of the literary 
facility which has formed a marked feature in 
his career. In this connection it is pleasing 
to reproduce some excellent verses written by 
Mr. Fuller years afterward, on the occasion 
of the death of General Grant, which show at 
once a loyal feeling of gratitude for the serv- 
ices of the great soldier, and a true poetic 
thought and diction — a power of composition 
rare in the learned, practiced and successful 
lawyer.

STATE OF MAINE. 



Let tbe drum to trumpet speak — 
The trumpet to tlie cannoneer witliout — 
The cannon to the heavens from each redoubt. 

Each lowly valley and each lofty peak. 
As to his rest the Great Commander goes 
Into the pleasant land of earned repose. 

Not In the battles won, 
Though long the well-fought fields may keep their name. 

But in the wide world's sense ot duty doue. 
The gallant soldier finds the meed of fame ; 
His life no struggle for ambitions prize. 
Simply the duty done that next him lies. 

Earth to its kindred earth ; 
The spirit to the fellowship of souls ! 
As. slowly. Time the mighty scroll unrolls 

Of waiting age.s yet to have their birth. 
Fame, faithful to the faithful, writes on high 
His name as one that was not born to die. 

An interesting incidenl connected with lii^ 
journalistic experience may be mentioned the 
fact that while Mr. Fuller was acting as re- 
porter for the Augiista Age (of which his 
uncle, B. A. C. Fuller, and himself were pub- 
lishers) in the Maine House of Representa- 
tives, James G. Blaine was engaged in a simi- 
lar capacity in the Senate for the Kciincbcc 
Jouriial. Though political opponents, then and 
in after life, the two men were always per- 
sonal friends, and at last, by a curious coinci- 
dence, found themselves together in Washing- 
ton—the one as Chief Justice of the United 
States, and the other as Secretary of State. 

Mr. Fuller, while practicing in Augusta, 
was elected city attorney at the age of twenty- 
three, and also president of the common coun- 
cil. In 1856 he visited Chicago, where he 
happened to meet Mr. S. K. Dow, from York 
county, Maine, a practicing lawyer. .\ part- 
ner of Mr. Dow was just retiring from the 
firm, and Mr. Dow offered Mr. Fuller a place 
in his office, either as partner or as a clerk 
at a salary of fifty dollars per month. He 
chose the latter, and worked on those terms 
for five months, living within his income. Be- 
fore a year had passed he enjoyed a consider- 
able and remunerative business, and in which 
he continued until he left the bar for the Su- 
preme Court. His legal career was strongly 
marked with industry, persistency and brilliant 
success. During his thirty years practice he 
was engaged in as many as three thousand 
cases at the Chicago bar. He affected no 
specialty in his profession, conducting a gen- 
eral practice, practically excluding divorce law 
and criminal law, in which class of cases his 
name scarcely appears. Among his most im- 
portant cases may be mentioned: Field vs. 
Letter; the Chicago Lake Front case; Storey 
vs. Storey; Storey vs. Storey E.state ; Hyde 
Park vs. Chicago ; Carter vs. Carter, etc., and 
the noted ecclesiastical trial of Bishop Cheney 
on the charge of heresy. He was engaged in 
many cases in the Supreme Court of the 



United States, and his first is reportetl in II 
Wallace, 108, and his last in 131 U. S., 371. 

Mr. Fuller's partnership with Mr. Dow con-^ 
tinued until i860. From 1862 to 1864 his 
firm was Fuller & Ham, then Fuller, Ham & 
Shepard for two years, and for two years 
thereafter Fuller & Shepard. In i86g he re- 
ceived as partner his cousin, Joseph E. Smith, 
son of Governor Smith, of Maine. This was 
terminated in 1877, after which he was alone. 
His business was only such as he cared to 
accept, and his professional income during hi,' 
later practicing years has been estimated at 
$20,000 to $30,000 per annum. 

Mr. Fuller took an early interest in politic.-, 
a staunch Democrat, he became, by sympalh 
and personal regard an earnest adherent of 
Senator Stephen A. Douglas, and on the death 
of the great statesman, June 3, 1861, he was 
made a member of the committee having 
charge of the funeral ceremonies. In autumn 
of the same year JMr. Fuller was elected a 
member of the Illinois Constitutional Conven- 
tion which assembled in 1862. He reported to 
that body the resolutions in memory of Senator 
Douglas, and made one of the opening ad- 
dresses of appreciation on that occasion. In 
1864 he was elected to the lower house of the 
Illinois legislature, and as a Unionist (not a 
Republican or anti-slaveryite) gave to the sup- 
port of the national government the same 
strenuous effort that was affonled by the sup- 
porters of Senator Douglas generally. He was 
a delegate to the Democratic national conven- 
tions of 1864, 1872, 1876 and 1880, always 
taking an active interest. Immediately after 
the election of Mr. Cleveland as president for 
his term, Mr. Fuller called upon him in Al- 
bany, and Mr. Cleveland at once conceived for 
him a high appreciation. On the death of 
Chief Justice Waite, it seemed desirable that 
his successor should be taken from the West, 
and Mr. Fuller's liberal education, high legi.=- 
lative ability, lofty professional Stan: ard, 
marked industry and command of language — 
all these, combined with his devotion to the 
principles of the party for which President 
Cleveland was the chosen exponent for the 
nation, made him a logical choice for the po- 
sition, which was accordingly offered him. j\Ir. 
Fuller, highly appreciating the high and un- 
expected honor, hesitated. 1 le was not am- 
bitious of distinction, and his large family 
necessitated his most careful consideration as 
to whether he could afford a position which 
would reward him less liberally than did his 
profession. He, however, consented, and on 
April 30, 1888, President Cleveland nominated

Mr. Fuller married (first) in 1858, Calista 
O., daughter of Eri Reynolds, and (second) 
May 30, 1866, Mary E., daughter of William 
F. Coolbaugh. a leading citizen of Chicago. 
She died .April 17, 1904, when the Chief Jus- 
tice practically retired from society. 



The name of Fuller is derived 
FULLER from the trade so called, mean- 
ing to mill or scour woolen 
cloth. In all probability this surname origi- 
nated in the county of Suffolk, formerly the 
chief seat of the W'Oolen manufacturing in- 
dustry in England, and it became a prominent 
one in the southeastern counties. John Ful- 
ler, supposed to have come over with Gov- 
ernor Winthrop, settled at Cambridge Vil- 
lage (now New-ton) in 1644. Thomas Ful- 
ler, wdio arrived from the mother country in 
1638, located first in Woburn and later in 
Middleton. John Fuller, of Ipswich, and an- 
other John PAiller, who settled in Saugus or 
Lynn, were both early immigrants and have 
often been mistaken for one and the same 
person. Another Thomas Fuller appears in 
the records of Dedham. Massachusetts, as a 
resident there in 1642, and his grandson John 
resided in Roxbury until 1733. 

(I) Ebenezer Fuller, a revolutionary sol- 
dier, was born in Roxbury, January 16, 1760, 
and resided in Boston. It is more than prob- 
able that he was a descendant of the Ded- 
ham settler previously referred to, but his 
line of descent could not be found in any of 
the records consulted. His death occurred in 
i8og. He was married May 5, 1793, to Lydia 



Goddard, born November 25, 1772, died Au- 
gust 11, 1828, ])resumably in Uoston. Their 
children were: Henrietta, Nabby G., Abigail, 
Thomas Jefferson and John. 

(II) John, \t)ungest child of Ebenezer and 
Lydia (Goddard) Fuller, was born in Rox- 
bury, December 18 or 28, i8o6. Having 
adopted the occupation which his name implies, 
that of a fuller or cloth-finisher, he followed . 
it in Lancaster, Massachusetts, for some time, 
and for twenty years thereafter he was in the 
comb-finishing business. John Er.Iler died 
1881. In his later years he supported the Re- 
publican part}-. He was a member of the Uni- 
tarian church. In 1827 he married Sophronia 
O. W. Adams, born in .Ashburiiham, Massa- 
chusetts, March 31, 1806, daughter of Samuel 
Adams, also born in Ashburnham. both born in 
the same house. Her death occurred May 3, 
1887. She became the mother of nine chil- 
dren, but four of whom — Sophronia, Eben, 
Sidney T. and Edward — are now living ; the 
others were : John, Henrietta, Abbie, Lydia 
and Eleanor. 

(HI) Sidne_\- Thomas, third son and fourth 
child of John and Sophronia O. W. (Adams) 
Fuller, was born in Shirley, Massachusetts, 
February 2, 1836. From the Lancaster public 
schools he entered the Wilbraham (Massachu- 
setts) Academy, and after completing the reg- 
ular course at that well-know-n institution, pur- 
sued a scientific course at Cambridge, giving 
his special attention to civil engineering. Turn- 
ing his attention to railway construction, he 
was employed in the building of the Burlington 
and Missouri River line, and subsequently en- 
tering the service of the Philadelphia, Wil- 
mington and Baltimore Railroad Company, 
was for seventeen years in charge of the main- 
tainance of way. Mr. Fuller was assistant 
engineer of construction of the first long 
bridge over the Susquehanna river at Havre 
de Grace, Maryland; built the first railway 
running into Mexico and was chief engineer 
and general superintendent of the r\Iexican 
railroad. As a recognized expert in the laying 
out and construction of railways and bridges 
he was secured by the railroad commissions of 
Massachusetts to examine and report the exact 
condition of railroads in that commonwealth, 
and in 1879-S0 he was similarly employed in 
the Russian Empire. In 1886 Mr. Fuller set- 
tled in Kennebunk and is still residing there. 
As secretary and treasurer of the local Loan 
and Building Association, he has labored dili- 
gently and effectively in its behalf for the past 
seventeen years, and he is otherwise concerned 
in the financial interests of the towm, having

been for nine years a director of the Ocean 
National Bank. He has served as a selectman, 
assessor and overseer of the poor ; represented 
his district in the lower branch of the state 
legislature for the years 1899-1903 ; and in 
politics is a Republican. He attends the Uni- 
tarian church. He is a Master Mason, be- 
longing to Havre de Grace Lodge, and also 
.affiliates with the Independent Order of Good 
Templars. 

On October 14, 1865, Mr. Fuller was united 
in marriage with Annette E., daughter of Dr. 
Orren and Elizabeth (Holden) Ross, of Ken- 
nebunk. Her grandparents were Simon and 
Mary (Perkins) Ross, of Kennebunk, and 
their eldest son, Orren, born September 14. 
18 1 2, acquired his early education in the dis- 
trict schools and at the North Brighton Acad- 
emy. At the age of fourteen years he en- 
tered the employ of Dixey Stone, a grocery 
merchant at Bridgton Centre, and prior to 
his majority he engaged in mercantile business 
for himself in Sweden, Oxford county, Maine. 
Selling his business in 1834, he turned his at- 
tention to teaching penmanship and later to the 
study of medicine. While a medical student 
at Bowdoin College he was for a period of 
three months an interne at the McLean Hos- 
pital in Boston, and receiving his degree with 
the class of 1839, he began the practice of his 
profession in Lyman. He subsequently re- 
moved to Kennebunk, residing there for the 
remainder of his life. Dr. Ross married Eliza- 
beth, daughter of Daniel and Sarah (Walker) 
Holden, of Sweden. She bore him seven chil- 
dren : Annette E., Isabel M., Orren S., Frank 
M., Florence H., and two who died in infancy. 
Annette E. is the wife of Sidney T. Fuller, as 
previously stated. Isabel M. married H. B. 
Thompson. Florence H. married James K. 
Cross. Mr. and Mrs. Fuller have had two 
children : Florabel and Sophronia Elizabeth, 
neither of whom are now living. Mrs. Fuller 
died January 7, 1908.

(I) John Rogers, immigrant 
ROGERS ancestor, was living in Scituate 
in 1647 on a lot of land lying 
between that of Thomas Hicks and John 
Stockbridge. There is a tradition that his 
father was a brother of Rev. William With- 
erell's mother, who was daughter of John Rog- 
ers, the martyr, but there is no proof of this, 
and it seems doubtful if that could have been 
the case. John Rogers removed to Marsh- 
field, Massachusetts, about 1647, where he re- 
sided until early in 1661. He was fined there 
several times for not attending town meeting.

suffered more or less persecution on that ac- 
count. He was a resident of Marshfield, and 
was grand juryman in 1659. ^^ 1692 he was 
selectman, and assisted in running the line 
between Marshfield and Scituate. He was on 
a committee to lay out highways in 1692. In 
his will, dated May 9, 1718, proved June 24,

The surnames Howard and 

HOWARD Hayward were once identical. 

.^mong the early settlers and 

their descendants the name was used inter- 



changeably, spelled Howard, Havvard, Ha- 
word, Havvoorth, etc. lleywood was also 
sometimes misspelled and the same spellings 
cited here used for that family. 

(I) John Howard, immigrant ancestor of 
the Bridgewater family, was born in England. 
He spelled his name Haward, but it was pro- 
nounced like Howard. Another family in 
Bridgewater at the same time, doubtless of 
the same ancestry, sijelled the name Hayward, 
though many of the later generations have also 
spelled their name Howard. John Howard 
was born in England. When a young man, 
he came to Plymouth and settled later in Dux- 
bury. Fie was able to bear arms, according to 
the list dated 1643. He was a volunteer for 
the Pequot war, June 7, 1637. His brother, 
James Howard, who came with him to Ply- 
mouth, went to the Bermudas. John removed 
to West Bridgewater, where he was a pro- 
prietor and original settler in 1651. He was a 
young man when he emigrated and lived for a 
time in the family of Captain Myles Standish. 
He became a citizen of much influence and 
prominence and one of the first military offi- 
cers of the town of Bridgewater. He took 
the oath of fidelity in 1659. His descendants 
lived on his original homestead until a gen- 
eration ago. He began to keep a tavern as 
early as 1670 and a tavern has been kept in 
Bridgewater down to recent times by his de- 
scendants. He died in 1700. He was an 
ensign in 1664. Children: i. John. 2. James. 
3. Jonathan, mentioned below. 4. Elizabeth, 
born at Plymouth, August 20, 1647, married 
Edward Fobes. 5. Sarah, married Zachariah 
Packard. 6. Bethia, married Henry Kingman. 
7. Ephraim. 

(II) Major Jonathan, son of John How- 
ard, married Sarah Dean, and among their 
children was a son Jonathan, mentioned be- 
low. 

(III) Jonathan (2), son of Alajor Jona- 
than (i) Howard, was born in 1692. He 
married Sarah, daughter of John Field, in 
1719, and among their children was a son 
Nathan, mentioned below. 

(IV) Nathan, son of Jonathan (2) How- 
ard, was born in 1720. He married Jane, 
daughter of Alajor Edward Howard, in 1746. 

(\') Nathan (2), son of Nathan (i) How- 
ard, was born in 1746. He married Susanna, 
daughter of Henry Howard, of eastern Mas- 
sachusetts, and among their children was a 
son Ruel, mentioned below. 

(VI) Ruel, son of Nathan (2) Howard, 
was born in 1776. He came to Alaine in 1814, 
and was a farmer, carpenter and contractor.

The derivation of this name is a 
ROBIE matter of conjecture, but Hon. 
Henry John Roby, M. P., from 
.Manchester, England, gives reasons for think- 
ing that the name is taken from the hamlet of 
Roby, in the parish of Huyton, five or six 
xniles east of Liverpool. Since 1403 the resi- 
dence of the Robies can be distinctly traced at 
Castle Donington, a small town in the north- 
ern edge of Leicestershire, England, which 
lies between the counties of Derby and Not- 
tingham. The name is variously spelled 
Robie, Roby, Robey, Robay, Robye, and 
Rooby, but was spelled Robie by Thomas, the 
father of Henry, the immigrant. Disconnected 
statements in the records of Castle Donington 
between 1402 and 15 12 show the existence of 
the family at that place between those dates. 
In September, 1402-1403, John Roby was pos- 
sessed of a copy hold in the manor of Castle 
Donington. 

(I) John Roby, with whom the connected 
history of the family begins, took part in the 
court proceedings of Castle Donington, in Oc- 
tober, 1512. In March, 1513, he was admitted 
tenant of two burgages. In June, 1513. he 
was named at a court at which William Roby 
and three others were admitted to three cur- 
tilages. He died shortly before Christmas, 
1 515. His children were: Thomas and Em- 
mot. 

(II) Thomas, son of John Roby, was born 
at Castle Donington, 1501, and May 6, 1516, 
he was admitted as son and heir of John Roby, 
to a taft, a croft, and one yard of land, and 
moiety of meadow, at a rent of twenty shillings 
.a year. In 1526 Emmot Roby was admitted 
to a cottage, to the use of his brother Thomas, 
who in each of the years 1527-32-36 was on 
the homage. In 1538-40 he was mentioned in 
the court proceedings. In 1542 he defended 
.a suit in chancery, and in 1547 was on the 



was buried at Castle Donington, December 5, 
1552, and his wife was also buried there, Feb- 
ruary 22, 1565. Their children were: Robert, 
John, Thomas, Edmond, William, Bartholo- 
mew, Michael and Marie. 

(HI) Thoinas (2), third child of Thomas 
( I ) and Elizabeth Roby, yeoman, was en- 
gaged in litigation concerning land in Don- 
ington Manor, in 1560-83-87, and mentioned 
in the proceedings of the Manor Court in 
1559-60-66, and 1586. He married (first) 
November 25, 1569, at Castle Donington, 
Joane Cowley, who was buried at Castle Don- 
ington, October 10, 1579. He married (sec- 
ond) April 22, 1583, at Castle Donington, 
Mary Gatley. By the first wife he had a son 
Thomas ; by the second wife a daughter Eliza- 
beth. He was buried at Castle Donington, 
April 12, 1588. In his will dated April 10, 
1588, proved at Leicester, September 12, of 
the same year, he speaks of his wife Mary and 
his children Thomas and Elizabeth (both un- 
der age) his brother John and his nephew 
John (under age), son of William, and makes 
bequests to John Gatley and Dorothy Gatley. 

(IV) Thomas (3) Robye (or Robie or 
Roby), only son of Thomas (2) and Joane 
(Cowley) Roby, was under age April, 1588. 
He was on the homage of the Manor Court 
in 1637-46, and probably other years. He died 
March 27, 1653. His will, dated March 24, 
1652, was proved at Westminster, September 
20, 1653. He married, C)ctober 6, 1606, Mary 
Coxon. born April 20, 1586, and buried at 
Castle Donington, April 26, 1641. She was 
the daughter of John Coxon. The children of 
this union were : Robert, Mary, Thomas, 
John, William, Henry, Edward, Samuel. 

(V) Henry, sixth child and fifth son of 
Thomas (3) and Mary (Coxon) Robie, born 
at Castle Donington, February 12, 1619, died 
April 22, 1688, in Hampton, New Hampshire, 
aged sixty-nine. Early in 1639 he came to 
Dorchester, Massachusetts Bay Colony. Soon 
after he went to Exeter, New Hampshire, 
which was founded by Rev. John Wheelwright 
the year before. This seems to have been his 
objective point. At that time there was no 
constituted authorities over the patent of New 
Hampshire, and the Exeters, as the Plymouth 
colonists before them had done, formed a vol- 
vmtary combination for governmental pur- 
poses, and this agreement, dated July 4, 1639, 
bears the signature of Henry Robie. In May, 
1643, he joined in the petition of the in- 
habitants of Exeter to the general court of 
Massachusetts, praying that their territory

might be received witliiii liie jurisdiction of 
Massachusetts ISay Colony. January i6, 1644, 
he received from the town a grant of ten acres 
of land, and February 10, UqiS, a further life 
grant of twenty acres; and .\pril 22, 1649, he 
and others were granted a mill site at Little 
river. Jn 1649-50 he was selectman, and 
March 21, 1650, received a further grant of 
ten acres of land. On May 13, 1650, as one 
of the committee of the town, he signed the 
contract engaging Rev. Samuel Dudley as 
minister. November 24, 1650, he was given 
permission to enlarge his garden out of the 
higlnvay, and on January 2, 1651, he received 
a further grant of sixty acres of land from 
the town, and on the same day with John Gil- 
man, dissented from the vote of the town, re- 
leasing the Rev. Samuel Dudley from pay- 
ment of certain rentals due the town, and on 
February 19, 165 1, the town authorized Henry 
Robie and two other tow^nsmen "to vindicate 
the credit and the reputation of (Rev.) Mr. 
Dmiley, against the reproachful speeches and 
calumniation of John Garland, by proceeding 
against him in law, according to the demerit 
of his offense." Soon after 1651 he removed 
into the present adjoining town of Hampton. 
He was selectman of Hampton for the years 
1656-60-65-81, and in 1660 was a member of 
the committee to regulate the seating of the 
people in the meeting house. On January i, 
1661, he was named as one of a commission to 
lay out the road, from the Academy green to 
the Landing, and in 1667 to settle the bounds 
of the highway between Hampton and Salis- 
bury. On October 12, 1669, at the session of 
the court, Henry Robie was allowed to keep 
an ordinary in the tow'n, and the court licensed 
him "to sell beere and wine and strong waters 
by retaile, and ye sd Robie doth binde him- 
self, in ye sum of £40, on condition not to 
suffer any townsmen, men's children and serv- 
ants to be lipling in his house." He kept the 
ordinary for about ten years, his license being 
renewed from year to year. On October 18, 
1669, he was attorney for the town, in a mat- 
ter before the court in Boston. In 1677 he 
was sent out to flank the Indians, who were 
besieging the Hampton settlement. His name 
and that of his wife are recorded as members 
of the town church on September 18, 167 1. A 
royal decree, made September 18, 1679, liaving 
ordered that thereafter the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony should have no further jurisdiction 
over the towns of Dover, Portsmouth, Exeter 
and Hampton, it became necessary to establish 
a new government for the Province of New 
Hampshire, to accomplish which Mr. Robie 



was named as one of the electors from liis 
town. July 13, 1680, he was foreman of the 
grand jury, and the same year one of the 
committee ajjiiointed to prosecute persons 
stealing lumber from the town. In 1683, with 
other residents of Hampton, he petitioned the 
colonial governor to be freed from head- 
money, and the same year was elected a mem- 
ber of the coiuicil from his town. He was a 
justice of the peace for many years, and Feb- 
ruary 6, 1683, with three other justices, signed 
the committment of Rev. Joshua Moody, pas- 
tor of the church in Portsmouth, for six 
months for refusing to administer the sacra- 
ment in accordance of the laws of Great 
Britain. He was a standing juryman in the 
trials of Mason against Richard Walderne 
and other persons in New^ Hampshire for 
holding lands which Mason claimed as pro- 
prietor of the province. His first wife, Ruth, 
died May 5, 1673, and he married (second) 
January 19, 1674, Widow Elizabeth Garland, 
daughter of Thomas Philbrick, who had pre- 
viously been the wife of Thomas Chase, and 
of John Garland. She died February 11, 1677. 
His third wife, Sarah, died January 23, 1703. 
His children were : Thomas, John, Judith, 
Ruth, Deliverance, Samuel and Ichabod by 
the first wife ; and Sarah by the third wife. 
Two other children, Joanna and Mary, may 
have been born to him. 

(VI) John, second child of Henry and Ruth 
Robie, born at Exeter, February 2, 1649, was 
killed June 16, 1691. He removed to Haver- 
hill in January, 1675, and lived in that part of 
the town which fell into New Hampsliire at 
the establishment of the ''Mitchell line." In 
a list made February i, 1677, of houses erected 
in Haverhill since January 25, 1675, is men- 
tioned that of John Robie. He lived in what 
is now- Atkinson. His wife died a few days 
before June 16. 1691, and on that day he was 
removing his family, consisting of seven chil- 
dren, the eldest not yet eleven years old, to a 
place of refuge in the North Parish. When 
they reached a spot opposite a burying ground 
described as "near Jesse Clements,"' Mr. Robie 
was shot by Indians and killed. 

(VII) Colonel Ichabod (probably the 
eldest), son of John and (Corlis) Robie, born 
in 1680, died between October 10, 1752. and 
September 26, 1753. He was taken captive by 
the Indians at the time his father was killed, 
June 16, 1691, and carried away. There are 
two traditions with respect to his return home. 
One is that he was ransomed ; and the other 
that by the aid of a friendly Indian he es- 
caped and returned home. He learned the art

of tanning, and settled in Hampton Falls, and 
established his home on what has ever since 
been known as "the Robie farm." He was a 
member of the ''Society for Settling the Chest- 
nut Country," attended the first meeting, and 
was one of the committee to lay out the lots, 
and also of the old hundred-acre lots, and also 
for running the lines. He is often mentioned 
in the records of Chester, and probably built 
a house on his home lot No. Ii6, and spent 
considerable time in the town, but never per- 
manently lived there. His will is dated Octo- 
ber lo, 1752, and proved September 26, 1753. 
He married, January 10, 1707, iMary Cass, 
born in Hamp"ton, February 26, 1687, daugh- 
ter of Joseph and Alary (Hobbs) Cass. Their 
children were: Anne, Ruth, John, Henry, 
Samuel, Mary and Sarah. 

(VHI) Samuel, fifth child and third son of 
Ichabod and IMary (Cass) Robie, was bom in 
Hampton, October 17, 1717. He lived first in 
Chester (Raymond), on his father's home lot 
No. 116. He sold his farm, including his tan- 
yard, to John S. Dearborn, in 1778, and took 
his pay in continental money which became 
worthless on his hands, and he lost all. He 
then removed to GoiTstown. He married 
(first) a Miss Perkins, by whom he had Sarah, 
Lvdia and Edward. He married (second) 
Widow Fhebe Butterfield, and had Samuel 
and Pollv, who lived at Goffstown. 

(IX) Edward, third child of Samuel and 

(Perkins) Robie, .born in Chester, 

1746, died December 26, 1837, aged ninety- 
two. He settled first in Candia, and later re- 
moved to Chester. He married, 1771, Sarah 
Smith, daughter of Colonel Webster's second 
wife. She died in 1843, ^ged eighty-nine. 
Thev had seven children: Mary. Asa, John 
Smith, Edward J., Toppan, Sarah and Thomas 
Sargent. 

(X) Captain Toppan, fourth son and fifth 
child of Edward and Sarah (Smith) Robie, 
born in Candia, New Hampshire, January 27, 
1782, died in Gorham, Maine, January 14, 
1871, aged eighty-nine. He remained with his 
parents until seventeen years of age and then, 
having received a practical education, he went 
to Gorham, Alaine, where he became a clerk 
in the store of John Horton, and a few months 
later went into" the employ of Daniel Cressey, 
then a leading trader of Gorham. In Septem- 
ber, 1802, while still a minor, he took the quite 
respectable sum of money which by prudence 
and economy he had saved from his earnings, 
and forming a partnership went into business 
with Sewafl Lancaster. In 181 5 he and his 
younger brother, Thomas S., became partners 



under the style of T. & T. S. Robie, retail 
merchants, and in the more than twenty year 
partnership, its members became widely known 
and popular throughout the states of Maine, 
New Hampshire and Vermont, where they 
were credited with great activity and abso- 
lutely square dealing. That was long before 
the days of railroads, and long lines of loaded 
sleds and sleighs came from the state of Ver- 
mont and Coos county. New Hampshire, 
through the Notch, on their way to Portland, 
and a good share of their trade fell to Gor- 
ham. Mr. Robie continued in business until 
1850, when he retired, having by his energy 
and strict attention to business accumulated a 
large fortune. For more than fifty years Top- 
pan Robie was a leading citizen not only of 
Gorham, but of a region including the various 
surrounding towns. He filled many local 
offices, and by his faithful and efficient 
service in the duties thereof proved his 
qualifications for higher positions and greater 
honors. In politics he was a Whig - 
and an earnest, unswerving adherent of 
his party. He served six terms as a repre- 
sentative in the general court of Massachu- 
setts, 1813 to 181 5, and after the province of 
Maine was removed from the jurisdiction of 
Massachusetts, in 1820, and made a state, he 
served in the first two legislatures of the new 
state, 1820-21. In 1837 he was a member of 
Governor Kent's council. For half a century 
he was a trustee of Gorham Academy, and for 
many years its treasurer. His contributions 
to that efficient school were generous and 
timely. He was also long the treasurer of the 
Congregational Parish and of its ministerial 
fund, to which latter he contributed $9,000. 
In the war of 1 81 2 he was captain of a mili- 
tia company and with his men marched to 
Portland in 1814, for the defence of the city. 
He was always ready to do his part in all 
public movements and no worthy cause ever 
sought his aid in vain. Toward the erection 
of the beautiful soldiers' monument, the first 
erected in Maine, which adorns the village of 
Gorham, Yhe generous tribute to the memory 
of the men who died in order that their coun- 
try might live, he donated $2.000 ; and toward 
the purchase of the town clock $500. In the 
evening of Tife he passed his years in that 
peace and tranquility which are the reward of 
right living. For seventy years he had resided 
among the people in whose midst he died. He 
married (first) October 8, 1804, Lydia Brown, 
of Chester, New Hampshire, born February 6, 
1782. died February 2^. 181 1, aged twenty- 
nine. She was the daughter of Benjamin and

(XI) Governor Frederick, youngest child 
of Captain Toppan and Sarah T. (Lincoln) 
Robie, was born in Gorham, August 12, 1822. 
After completing the usual studies at Gorham 
Academy, and with private tutors, he entered 
Bowdoin College in 1837, and was graduated 
with the class of 1841. After graduating he 
went south and for a time taught in Georgia 
academies and in Florida. While there he de- 
cided to become a physician, and matriculated 
at Jefiferson Medical College, Philadelphia, and 
was graduated from that institution in 1844. 
In April of the same year he opened an ofSce 
in Biddeford, where he practiced eleven years. 
In 1855 he removed to Waldoboro, where he 
remained three years. In each of these towns 
his practice was extensive and profitable. Re- 
turning to Gorham he resided there until the 
outbreak of the slaveholders' rebellion. |une 
I, 1 86 1, he was commissioned by President 
Lincoln, paymaster of United States Volun- 
teers. He served in the Army of the Potomac 
until 1863, and was then transferred to Bos- 
ton as chief paymaster of the Department of 
New England. In 1864 he was sent to the 



Department of the Gulf of New Orleans, 
where he paid the troops for a year, or until 

1865. At the end of the war he returned to 
Maine, where he had charge of the paying off 
of the Maine soldiers. Mis efficient services 
were recognized and rewarded by the brevet 
commission of lieutenant-colonel, dated No- 
vember 24, 1865, Ii^ being the first Maine pay- 
master to receive brevet of that rank. He was 
honorably mustered out July 20, 1866, and at 
once returned with energy to the pursuit of 
peace, his course having been approved by 
both liie government and the people of the 
state. In 1866 Colonel Robie was elected to 
the state senate, and re-elected the following 
year. He was also appointed in 1866 by Wil- 
liam Pitt Fessenden as special agent of the 
treasury department, in which capacity he 
served two years. From 1868 to 1873 ^^ was 
a member of the Republican state committee. 
He was a member of the house of representa- 
tives eight years, and in all served ten terms 
in the Maine legislature. In 1872 and 1876 
he was speaker of the house. He is an able 
parliamentarian, and discharged the duties of 
his position with a skill born of much ex- 
perience and a courtesy and grace which were 
pleasing to all, and contributed in no slight 
degree to the dispatch of business that dis- 
tinguished these periods. He was a member 
of Governor Washburn's executive council in 

1866, of that of Governor Davis in 1880, and 
of that of Governor Plaisted in 1881-82. In 
1872 he was a delegate to the Republican Na- 
tional convention which nominated General 
Grant for a second term. In 1878 he was ap- 
pointed commissioner of the Paris Exposition, 
and traveled extensively- in Euro]je drring the 
year he remained abroad. In 1882. at the 
meeting of the Republican state convention in 
Portland, Colonel Robie was nominated for 
governor. At the ensuing electicn Colonel 
Robie received a plurality of about nine thou- 
sand votes over the Democratic candidate. 
Governor Harris M. Plaisted. In 1884 Gov- 
ernor Robie was again nominated and re- 
elected by a majority of nearly twenty thou- 
sand votes, which plainly showed that the 
firm, intelligent and business-like administra- 
tion of Governor Robie had the full approval 
of his entire party and of many good citizens 
of other parties, who cast their ballots for him. 
A retrospect shows him to have been one of 
the most efficient and popular governors the 
state of Maine has ever had. In various busi- 
ness enterprises Governor Robie has been and 
now is an active and powerful business factor. 
For many years he was a ilirector of the Port- 



32 



STATE OF iMAINE. 



land & Rochester Railroad Company ; also a 
director of the First National Bank, of which 
he is now and for seventeen years has been 
president. In 1885 he was president of the 
Eastern Telegraph Company, and one time he 
was business manager of the Portland Press 
Publishing Company. He is also a director of 
the financial committee of the Mutual Life In- 
surance Company. Governor Robie was 
raised in a community where agricultural in- 
fluences were predominant, and his interest in 
the cultivation of the soil and those who carry 
it on has always been hearty and sincere. Not 
long after the grange movement was started 
he allied himself with it and still gives it his 
strong support. He was chosen worthy mas- 
ter of the Maine State Grange in 1881, and 
continued in that office the ensuing eight years. 
Naturally he feels a deep and abiding interest 
in the Grand Army. He became a member of 
John R. Adams Post at Gorham, and has been 
one of the foremost to aid in the promotion of 
many of the wise measures undertaken by that 
organization. During the year 1899 he was 
commander of the Department of Maine of the 
Grand Army of the Republic. For over nine- 
teen years he has been president of the board 
of trustees of the Insane Hospital of the state 
at Augusta. This institution has received 
much of his attention, and every annual report 
of the trustees has been written by him. While 
a member of the legislature the question of the 
location of the State Normal school came up 
and he was instrumental in securing its loca- 
tion in Gorham. He has generously con- 
tributed to its success and the trustees hon- 
ored him by calling the handsome new dormi- 
tory "Frederick Robie Hall," and that in- 
scription is cut in its granite walls. Similarly, 
the active and permanent interest of Governor 
Robie in the public schools of Gorham, mani- 
fested in a multitude of ways, prompted his 
fellow townsmen to change the corporation 
name of one of the Gorham schools to the 
"Frederick Robie High School." The same 
high qualities that made his father a leading 
man in the region about Gorham, have made 
Governor Robie one of the ablest, most pro- 
gressive, most influential and most highly es- 
teemed citizens of the commonwealth over 
whose destinies he has had the honor twice to 
preside. The strong character he inherits 
from various lines of worthy ancestors has 
placed him in the front rank of the patriotic, 
worthy and leading men of the state, and his 
unvarying courtesy, kindliness of heart, in- 
tegrity, liberality, and irreproachable charac- 
ter have made him a mvriad of friends whose 



regard is lifelong. Governor Robie has re- 
cently become a member of the Society of 
Mayflower Descendants in the State of Maine, 
tracing his descent from Richard Warren, one 
of the passengers of the "Mayflower," a signer 
of the compact, and a six year resident of 
Plymouth, Massachusetts. 

Frederick Robie married (first) November 
12, 1847, Mary Olivia Priest, born in Bidde- 
ford, September 23, 1828, died November 5, 
1898. daughter of Jonathan and Mary (Em- 
ery) Priest, of Biddeford. She was a lady of 
many accomplishments, unusually proficient as 
a pianist, and also endowed with those per- 
sonal graces and social qualities which endear 
their possessor to all whom they meet. Four 
children were born of this union : Harriet,. 
Mary Frederica, Eliza and William P. F. 
Harriet, born September 3, 1848, married 
Clark H. Barker, one time postmaster of Port- 
land, now deceased. Two children were born 
of this marriage; Mary Olivia and Benjamin 
Barker. JMary Frederica, born March 3, 1852,, 
married George F. McQuillan, a prominent 
lawyer of Portland ; one child was born of this 
marriage, Harriet R. Eliza, born February, 
1856, died September 3, 1863. William P. F. 
is mentioned below. Governor Robie married 
(second) January 10, 1900, Martha E. Cres- 
sey, born in Gorham, Alay 3, 1849, daughter 
of Alvin and Sarah (Flagg) Cressey. She 
had always resided on the farm where she was 
born, and has always been interested in agri- 
culture and the farm is now carried on under 
her direction. She is a member of the Congre- 
gational church ; the Order of the Eastern 
Star : the Relief Corps, Grand Army of the 
Republic ; and the Patrons of Husbandry. 

(Nil) William Pitt Fessenden, youngest 
child and only son of Governor Frederick and 
Mary Olivia (Priest) Robie, was born in Dor- 
chester, Massachusetts, November 5, 1863. 
From the public schools he went to the pre- 
paratory school at Fryeburg, Maine, and grad- 
uated from that institution in 1884. The same 
year he entered Bowdoin College, from which 
he was graduated with the class of i88g. 
After leaving college he assisted his father if 
the management of his farm in Gorham unti.

present time. He resides m Gorham, Maine.

The -MacQuillans were 
McQuillan powerful chiefs of county

turers. The McQuillans became lords of the 
northern coast of Ireland, and the contiguous 
territory from Dunsevcrick Castle in the 
county Antrim, near the Giant's Causeway, to 
Dunluce Castle. Dunseverick, built according 
to tradition by the McQuillans, is now a heap 
of ruins ; and Dunluce a once strong and beau- 
tiful fortress, is dismantled and crumbled with 
age. MacDonnell, a Scottish chieftain, mar- 
ried a daughter of McQuillan, and came into 
possession of the Antrim territory. King 
lames First confirmed the title of the McDon- 
nell to the country, and since that time a Mc- 
Donnel has 5een Earl of Antrim. The Mc- 
Quillans became scattered through northern 
Ireland, and from there to all parts of the 
world.

navy. In course of time, being a man of fine 
physique and soldierly bearing, brave and of 
good habits, he was promotecl to the position 
of a subordinate officer. He came to America

of his father he went to live with a gentleman 
in Windham. Maine, who gave him a good 
education, and with whom he stayed until he 
attained his majority. Afterward he studied 
for the christian ministry, and was ordained a 
minister of the Christian Baptist church. From 



that time forward he was engaged in evangeli- 
cal work until the time of his death. He was a

27, 1881. Mrs. McQuillan was a woman of 
noble character, a companion and helpmeet to 
her husband, and after his death did all in her 
power to keep her children together, and give 
them the best education her circumstances per- 
mitted. Children: Rufus H., mentioned be-

STATE OF MAINE. 



from which he graduated in 1875. In 1868 he 
began to teach school, and partly with the 
money thus earned and partly with funds sup- 
plied by his mother, he paid his way while at 
Bovvdoin. He took an interest in certain kinds 
of athletics, and was a member of Bowdoin's 
boating crew one year. .--Xfter completing his 
college course he continued to teach, and for 
two years he was employed in high schools in 
the northern part of Cumberlancl county. In 
1877 he began the study of law with Hon. Bion 
Bradbury in Portland, Maine, which he con- 
tinued until his admission to the bar. October

where he practiced one year, during which 
time he served as town clerk and supervisor 
of schools. In October, 1880, he removed to 
Portland, and entered upon his career as a 
practitioner of law, in which he has achieved 
much success, his practice being in the local 
courts. He is a member of the supreme judi- 
cial court of Maine and of the district, cir- 
cuit, and supreme courts of the United States. 
His practice has included the ordinary class of 
commercial litigation, and in addition to that 
he has been attorney and counsellor for vari- 
ous towns in Cumberland county. He is well 
known as an able, reliable and successful law- 
yer. From December i, 1892, until May 28,

torney. Since then Mr. McQuillan has prac- 
ticed alone. In political sentiment Mr. Mc- 
Quillan is a Democrat, and is one of the 
trusted leaders of his party. June 6, 1881, he 
was appointed judge advocate general with 
the rank of Colonel, on the staff of Governor 
Plaisted, and served as such until January 3. 
1883. In 1882, 1886 and in 1890, he was a 
candidate for clerk of the courts of Cumber- 
land county ; and in 1892 and i8g6 he was can- 
didate for judge of probate; and in each case 
received the full support of his party in the 
canvass and at the polls; but the Democratic 
party being in a minority, he was defeated. 
Colonel McQuillan is fond of the company of 
his books, which make a goodly library, and 
takes that interest in education and literature 
that every liberally educated man should take.

(II) Henry, eldest child of Dea- 
\^'IGHT con Thomas and Alice or Elsie 
Wight, settled with his parents 
in Dedham, Massachusetts, in 1637. In the 
Dedham records he was called Sergeant Henry

was appointed constable by the general court. 
In 1 661 he was elected selectman and held 
that office ten years, between that time and 
the time of his death, P'ebruary 27, 1680. In 
1665 the town granted him one hundred and 
twenty acres of land, which was an unusually 
large gift ; but the record gives no explanation 
as to wdiy it was done. February 24, 1673, 
Henry \\'ight was one of the three citizens 
of Dedham appointed to lay out a house lot 
for Rev. Samuel Mann at Wrentham, and to 
take care about the church lot there. He was 
appointed one of the executors of his father's 
will, by the provisions of which he received 
all his father's "houses and lands lying and 
being in Dedham." This devise included the 
original grant of twelve acres from the town 
to Thomas Wight. He died intestate, and his 
estate was administered by his widow and his 
son Joseph. His inventory amounted to

bury, about 1652. She joined the church June 
12, 1653, and died in Dedham, May 16, 1684.

ham. She was living at extreme old age April 
2, 1764, seventy-seven years after her first 
marriage, as is shown by her signature to a 
deed of release of all her dower interest in the 
landed property belonging to her first husband.

cember 29, 1729, and died in Otisfield, Maine, 
October 20, 1804. In 1871 he prospected at 
New Marblehead (Windham), Alaine, where 
long before his remote cousin, Rev. John 
\\'ight, had settled. His movements from 1781 
to the fall of 1783 are variously reported. In 
November, 1783, he removed with all of his 
family, except his son James, from Wrentham, 
Massachusetts, to Otisfield, Maine, where he 
settled on "a beautiful ridge of land near the 
center of the town," a portion of which is still 
owned by his posterity. He was a fanner and 
part proprietor of a saw mill upon Saturday 
pond in Otisfield ; and besides attending to 
farming and milling, he was handy in various 
mechanical pursuits, as the entries in his ac- 
count book between 1785 and 1794 show. His 
family were an uncommonly hardy and ath- 
letic race : all were well educated for the times, 
and became well off financially. Joseph Wight 
married (first) in Wrentham, September 22, 
1755, Abigail Farrington, of the same place, 
who died August 25, 1758, aged twenty-one. 
He married (second) July 9, 1763, in 
Wrentham, Abigail Ware, born December 15, 
1740, died IMarch 29, 1799, in Otisfield. He 
had by the first wife two children : An in- 
fant and Joseph ; and by the second wife seven 
children : Benjamin, Abigail, James, Thomas, 
Nathan, Warren and Jonathan. 

(\T) Jonathan (3), youngest child of Jo- 
seph and Abigail (Ware) Wight, was born in 
Wrentham, I\lassachusetts. September 7, 1783, 
died in Naples, Maine, March i, 1869. He 
removed in 17S3 with his father, as above 
stated, to Otisfield, but after his marriage he 
bought a large estate in Naples, Maine, and 
resided there a long time. He married, in 
Otisfield, July 6, 1805, Mercy, born December 
10, 1788, died February 13, 1861, daughter of 
Edward and Mary (Plaisted) Harmon, of 



Alfred, Maine. Children: Elvira, Hermon, 
Priscilla Loud, Abigail Ware, Edward, Tabor, 
Olive, David Kay, Joseph, Xatlian, Mary and 
Addison. 

(VII) Elvira, eldest child of Jonathan and 
Mercy (Harmon) Wight, was born in Otis- 
field, April 16, 1807, and married, at Naples, 
in 1842, Rev. Hugh McL. McQuillan, of 
Windham, Maine. (See McQuillan.) 



It is often pleasant for a quiet New 

HILL England village to claim by birth- 
right tile name of one who has 
gained the notice and esteem of the public by 
his wisdom and judgment in public life and 
affairs. The attractive town of Eliot, on the 
rim of the beautiful and historic Piscataqua, 
has had several public characters who have 
given honor to this locality, which was their 
birthplace and boyhood home. Among them 
is the recent governor of Maine, the Hon. 
John Fremont Hill, M. D. And not only his 
public official life, and his energetic business 
career has established his name, but a very 
pleasant family genealogy precedes him. 

The name Hill begins even at the Plymouth 
Colony, shortly after the feet pressed Plym- 
outh Rock. From the famed Plymouth Col- 
ony ( 1630) the name was familiar in Boston, 
and in 1639 was known in Dover, New Hamp- 
shire, now the city not far from the Eliot of 
Maine. 

It was the second John Hill, perhaps, who 
was in Dover in 1639, and in 1653, whose de- 
scendants were known both in Dover and in 
Kittery, now Eliot. 

Joseph Hill, of the third generation, was in 
Dover ; a man of strength of character ; he 
was constable and collector of public funds. 

Samuel Hill, of the fourth generation, be- 
came a citizen of Eliot. He was the eldest 
son of Joseph Hill. Samuel's name is his- 
toric ; he became a member of the Society of 
Friends, and the Friends of that section of 
Eliot became renowned and left a most inter- 
esting chapter of village story and history. 
Samuel (4) possessed land on the upper side 
of Cammocks creek, in Eliot. He married, 
December 23, 1721, Hannah Allen, daughter 
of Francis and Hannah (Jenkins) Allen, of 
Kittery ; the names of seven children are on 
record : Joseph, Isaac, Simeon, Miriam, 
Ruth, Huldah, Jerusha. 

Isaac, son of Samuel and Hannah (Allen) 
Hill, also resided in Eliot. He married (first) 
Lydia, daughter of Joseph Roberts, of Dover; 
she died September 17, 1769. Married (sec- 
ond) March 24. 1773, Elisabeth Estes, of

STATE OF MAINE. 



Dover, daughter of Elijah and Sarah (Hodg- 
don) Estes. She died October lo, 1784. Mar- 
ried (third) March 24, 1786, Widow Lucy 
Hill. His children were : Samuel, Simeon, 
Abner, Stephen, Lydia, Hannah. (The third 
wife was the mother of Lydia and Hannah.) 

Samuel, eldest child of Isaac and Elisa- 
beth (Estes) Hill, was born April 13, 1777, 
died in Eliot in 1865. He inherited his fath- 
er's estate in Eliot and passed his life there ; 
an honest farmer, and a much respected citi- 
zen. His kindly face, pleasant voice and man- 
ner are still remembered. He married, at 
Salem, the historic city in ^Massachusetts, by 
the Rev. Mr. Spaulding, April 28, 1799, Elisa- 
beth Rawson. She was the daughter of John 
and Elisabeth (Bruce) Rawson; she was 
born February 7, 1776. Their children were: 
Joseph, Eliza, John, Stephen, Mary, Samuel, 
Elisabeth, Asa A., Ira. ]\Iartha Estes and 
William, whose sketch follows. 

William Hill, youngest child of Samuel and 
Elisabeth (Rawson) Hill, was born on the 
ancestral acres in Eliot, February 4, 1821, and 
died there. November ij, 1902, aged eighty- 
one years. He was a man of wealth, a person 
of sterling integrity, good judgment, execu- 
tive ability and generously endowed with com- 
mon sense. Though qualified to fill a high 
station in business or public life, he chose to 
follow in the beaten path his ancestors trod ; 
and was a successful and highly regarded far- 
mer. He married, November 27, 1849, 
Miriam Leighton, born [May 7, 1819, died No- 
vember 9, 1876. She was the daughter of An- 
drew P. and Sarah C. (Odiome) Leighton, 
of Kitterv. Married (second) Jennie Brooks. 
The children of William and Miriam Hill 
were : Ella Bruce, John Fremont, Lizzie 
Rawson and Howard. Ella Bruce, born Sep- 
tember 19, 1850, married, November 29, 1877, 
Homer Hobbs, of Berwick. Lizzie Rawson, 
born March 23, 1857, married, December 18, 
1883, William L. Hobbs, of Dover. 

The Hon. John Fremont, M. D., second 
child of William and Miriam (Leighton) Hill, 
was born on the homestead of his ancestors 
in Eliot, October 29, 1855. He acquired his 
literary education in the public schools of 
Eliot, and in the Eliot and South Berwick 
academies. In 1874 he matriculated in the 
medical department of Bowdoin College, 
Brunswick, from which he graduated Doctor 
of Medicine in 1877. Subsequently he took a 
post-graduate course at Long Island Hospital, 
Brooklyn, New York. In 1877 he began the 
practice of his profession at Boothbay Har- 
bor. He remained a year, then went to Au- 



gusta, where after six months' practice he 
decided in 1879 to enter a more active busi- 
ness life, and joined Peleg O. Vickery, of 
Augusta, in the publication of periodicals. In 
a short time he became junior partner in the 
firm of Vickery & Hill, one of the most suc- 
cessful enterprises of its kind. In 1900 a sub- 
stantial fireproof building with all modern im- 
provements was erected in Augusta, to accom- 
modate the large and constantly increasing 
business of the firm, now incorporated as the 
Vickery & Hill Publishing Company. Gov- 
ernor Hill's fine executive ability and success 
in business led to his becoming an extensive 
owner and a leading organizer of electric 
railroad lines in Maine. From boyhood he 
entertained an abiding interest in politics, and 
early in life became an active participant in 
the councils and campaigns of the Republican 
party. In 1889 he was elected to represent 
Augusta in the legislature, and served on the 
committees on banks and banking, railroads, 
telegraphs and expresses. In 1891 he was re- 
elected, and served as chairman of the com- 
mittee on railroads. In August, 1892, he was 
nominated by acclamation for senator from 
Kennebec county, was elected and re-elected, 
and served in the legislature during the ses- 
sions of 1893-95, in that capacity, being chair- 
man of the railroad committee each term. In 
1896 he was a presidential elector and in 1899 
and 1900 a member of Governor Powers' 
council. In the latter year he was nominated 
for governor of Maine, and at the September 
election following he was elected by one of the 
largest majorities ever given in the state. The 
able and business-like address which he deliv- 
ered at his inauguration the following January 
foreshadowed an administration in which the 
duties of the office would be discharged in a 
proper manner, and the close of his term 
showed that the people of the state had made 
no mistake in placing him in the gubernatorial 
office. The large floating debt incurred during 
the Spanish-American war was extinguished, 
and all the financial affairs of the state re- 
ceived due attention and were in excellent con- 
dition at the close of his term of office. In 
1902 Dr. Hill was a candidate for re-election 
to the governorship, and his election by one of 
the largest votes ever cast in an oiif year was 
a satisfactory and significant indorsement of 
his course as an officer. His second term was 
a period of prosperity in the state, and when 
he finally vacated the governor's chair he re- 
tired with the approval of his administration 
by a prosperous and contented people. Dur- 
ing his terms of service as the state's chief

executive, Governor 11 ill and family resided in 
tlie Mansion on State street, in Augusta, which 
was for many years the home of lion. James 
(i. Blaine. In 1902 he built, a short distance 
away, on the same street, in the center of the 
residential portion of the city, a palatial home 
of St. Louis brick, with trimmings of Maine 
granite, which with its artistic furnishings and 
clecorations is one of the finest resiliences in 
New England. Governor Hill is a Uni- 
versalist in religious faith and contributes 
generously to the support of the organization 
of which he is a member and also to other 
similar organizations. He has always felt a 
deep regard for his native town, and to his 
encouragement and financial assistance the 
preparation and publication of its history in 
1893 is largely due. He is a member of vari- 
ous patriotic and fraternal organizations and 
of several clubs, among which are : The 
Maine Historical Society; the Society of May- 
flower Descentlants ; the Society of Colonial 
Wars; the Pepperell Society (composed of de- 
scendants of Sir William Pepperell) ; the 
Abnaki Club of Augusta, i\Iaine ; the St. 
Louis Club and the St. Louis Country Club of 
St. Louis, Missouri; Augusta Lodge, No. 141, 
Free and .Vccepted Masons; Cushnoc Chap- 
ter, Royal Arch Masons; Trinity Command- 
ery ; Knights Templar ; and Kora Temple, 
Ancient Arabic Order of the Mystic Shrine. 

Dr. John Fremont Hill married (first) May 
19, 1880, Lizzie G. Vickery, who died April 
10, 1893. She was the daughter of Hon. 
Peleg O. Vickery, of Augusta. He married 
(second) in St. Louis, April 25, 1897, Mrs. 
Laura Liggett, widow of Hiram S. Liggett, 
and daughter of Hon. Norman J. Colman, of 
St. Louis, who was secretary of agriculture in 
the first cabinet of President Cleveland. A 
son. Percy, was born of the first marriage, 
March 16, 1881. and a daughter by the second 
marriage, Katharine, born December 23, 1904. 



The ancestry of one of the most 
REED distinguished men Maine ever pro- 
duced has not been traced far back. 
The earliest ancestor of Hon. Thomas B. Reed 
on tlic paternal side was 

( 1 ) Joseph Reed, who resided on Peak's 
Island in Portland Harbor, where he died 
April I, 1832. He married, November 10, 
1796, Mary Brackett (see Brackett \T), bap- 
tized June 9, 1776, died November 13, i860, 
daughter of Thomas and Jane (Hall) Brack- 
ett. Their children, born on Peak's Island, 
were : Mary Elizabeth, and Thomas B., next 
mentioned. 



(II) Thomas Brackett, youngest child of 
Joseph and Mary (Brackett) Reed, was born 
on Peak's Island, .August 24, 1803, and died in 
Portland, 1883. He married, in 1838, Matilda 
R. Mitchell. Children: Thomas B., men- 
tioned below. Harriet L. S., born June, 1846, 
married Elisha W. Conley, manager of the 
Standard Oil Works, Portland. 

(HI) Thomas Brackett (2), only son of 
Thomas Brackett (i) and Matilda R. 
(Mitchell) Reed, was born October 13, 1839, 
in a house on Hancock street, Portland, near 
the house where the poet Longfellow first saw 
the light. He attended the public schools 
where he prepared for college, and in 1856 en- 
tered Bowdoin College. In his class were 
many students who afterward attained dis- 
tinction. From Portland were Joseph W. 
Symonds, now one of the foremost lawyers in 
the state, William W. Thomas, now minister 
to Sweden, Colonel Albert W. Bradbury, John 
Marshall Brown, Nicholas E. Boyd and Sam- 
uel S. Boyd. Other well known members of 
the class were Hon. Amos L. Allen, since rep- 
resentative in the national legislature. Horace 
H. Burbank, of Saco, Abner H. Davis, and 
John F. .\ppleton, of Bangor. While he, in a 
measure, pursued his studies to suit himself 
and did not follow closely the college curricu- 
lum, he was still at graduation among the very 
first in his class for the scholarship required. 
At commencement he delivered an oration, and 
the subject he chose was the "Fear of Death," 
and his method of treating it made a profound 
impression on his hearers. A classmate said 
of him : "It is safe to say that no young man 
ever departcl from Bowdoin College leaving 
behind him a stronger impression of intel- 
lectual capacity, of power reserved and hith- 
erto unused, of ability to act a high and noble 
part in public life or a more universal expecta- 
tion among teachers and classmates of great 
antl brilliant service in the future. His old 
teachers at Bowdoin if they were still living 
would look with no surprise upon the achieve- 
ments of his life, great and splendid as they 
have been." After leaving college he taught 
for something more than a year, being a part 
of that time an assistant in the Portland high 
school. During this time he was studying law 
in the office of Howard & Strout in Portland. 
Later he went to California, where he was ad- 
mitted to the bar. but he soon returned to 
Portland. In April, 1864, he was appointed 
assistant paymaster in the L^nited States navy, 
and attached to the "tinclad" "Sibyl," whose 
commander subsequently performed the re- 
markable task of bringing the obelisk "Cleo- 



38 



STATE OF MAINE. 



patra's Needle" from Egypt to New York City. 
Leaving the navy, he returned to Portland 
and was admitted to the bar. He rose rapidly 
in his profession and soon became conspicuous 
in his profession. 

His political career began in 1867, when he 
was elected to the Maine house of representa- 
tives from Portland. He served on the ju- 
diciary committee and it was largely due to his 
efforts that the superior court was established 
in Cumberland county. After serving two 
terms in the house he was elected to the sen- 
ate from Cumberland county. Before his term 
expired he was chosen attorney general, his 
competitors being Harris M. Plaisted and Ed- 
win B. Smith, both men of distinction. He 
was then but thirty years old, the youngest 
man who had held this office in Maine. Mr. 
Reed filled this office three years and during 
that time he tried many important cases. On 
his recommendation as attorney general the 
law was so changed that a wife could testify 
against her husband. At the end of his term 
of service as attorney general Mr. Reed be- 
came city solicitor of Portland and served 
four years ; many important cases effecting the 
city's interests arose during this period. At 
one time Mr. Reed was associated with 
Manasseh Smith in the practice of law and 
subsequently for a time with Hon. Clarence 
Hale, afterwards judge of the United States 
district court. In 1876 Mr. Reed became a 
candidate for the Republican nomination to 
congress against Congressman John H. Bur- 
leigh, and this marked his entry into national 
politics. The contest was a memorable one, 
but Mr. Reed received the nomination by a 
small margin and was elected by a plurality 
of about a thousand over his opponent, John 
M. Goodwin, the Democratic candidate. Un- 
til he resigned in 1899, Mr. Reed was nomi- 
nated by acclamation for every successive 
congress and elected. Mr. Blaine alone ever 
had so long a career in the house of repre- 
sentatives from Maine. The house in which 
Mr. Reed first took his seat was Democratic 
and he received the treatment usually accorded 
new members, by being appointed on the com- 
mittee on territories. He made his first 
speech in congress April 12, 1878, and its 
clearness and cogency gave him a high stand- 
ing in the house. Another opportunity to 
demonstrate his acumen and efifectiveness came 
when as a member of the Potter committee he 
took a part in the investigation of the election 
of 1876, during which proceeding he e.x- 
amined many distinguished witnesses. This 
made him known throughout the country. 



Four years later Mr. Reed was chairman of 
the judiciary committee, a position of honor 
and influence. The following three con- 
gresses were Democratic and Mr. Reed had no 
conspicuous part except as a debater. Grad- 
ually he worked himself up to be the recog- 
nized leader of the Republicans on the floor. 
The distinction came to him simply through 
merit. He became the leader of the minority, 
because his party generally recognized that he 
was the man best fitted for the place. He had 
plenty of courage, was ready and effective in 
debate and thoroughly versed in the rules of 
the house and parliamentary practice in gen- 
eral to which he had given special attention. 
Mr. Reed's leadership excited no jealousies 
simply for the reason that all felt he had it by 
right. He had not thrust himself forward, he 
resorted to no arts to gain it, he simply dem- 
onstrated his capacity to lead and his party 
did the rest. In the forty-ninth congress his 
leadership was formally acknowledged by his 
party by conferring upon him the nomination 
for speaker. In the fiftieth congress he also 
received that honor. In 1888 Harrison was 
elected president and the fifty-first congress 
was Republican. Reed, McKinley and Can- 
non were candidates for speaker and Reed was 
made the candidate of his party on the first 
ballot, and subsequently chosen speaker of the 
house. It was as speaker of the house that 
Mr. Reed did the act that will always be re- 
membered as the most conspicuous one in his 
career. While the constitution was silent on 
the point it had been the practice from the 
foundation of the government not to count 
members present unless they answered to their 
names. The result was that frequently while 
there was a quorum of members actually pres- 
ent in the house business was paralyzed be- 
cause they would not answer to their names. 
There is no doubt that Mr. Reed formed a 
purpose to count a quorum long before the 
liouse met, and this purpose he carried out 
with calmness and deliberation. He first 
counted a quorum before the house had 
adopted any rules, acting under the sanction 
of general parliamentary law. When the 
house adopted its rules, one empowering the 
speaker to count a quorum was included and 
the practice was forever established that a 
member present is to be recognized as present 
for quorum purposes just as much as if he had 
answered to his name when it was called. 
There was a great clamor, and the speaker was 
charged with subverting, for partisan advan- 
tage, the very foundation of the government. 
The matter was taken to the supreme court

which sustaiiKd the Icgahty of Mr. Reed's pro- 
cedure, and what was pruiiouiiced revtjhitioii- 
ary and subversive of the rights of the people 
is now acknowledged by all parties as a cor- 
rect and sensible rule of i)rocedure. The 
justice of Mr. Reed's rules became apparent 
at the very next congress, which was Demo- 
cratic and adopted them in substance and ever 
since they have been the rules of the house of 
representatives. Mr. Reed's act, which now 
seems but a simple thing, was one that none 
but a man of iron will and courage that (jiiailed 
at nothing could have done. The enactment 
of the McKinley tariff bill was the most im- 
portant piece of legislation of the fifty-first 
congress and one of its effects was to tem- 
porarily raise the prices of certain articles. 
This proved exceedingly disastrous to the Re- 
publicans and the next congress was over- 
whelmingly Democratic. In that congress Mr. 
Reed became the leader of the Republicans on 
the floor. He contrived to hold this position 
during the next congress which was also Dem- 
ocratic, and he led the onslaught against the 
Wilson tarilif bill which precipitated one of 
the most interesting and important tariff de- 
bates in the history of congress. One of Mr. 
Reed's longest and most convincing speeches 
was made during this debate. In it he de- 
fended the principle of the protective tariff 
and pointed out in a most effective way the 
danger and folly of abandoning the home mar- 
ket and going in search of questionable foreign 
markets. The bill was passed and it brought 
to the Democrats the same kind of disaster the 
McKinley bill had brought to the Republicans. 
The congress which was elected following the 
passage of this bill in the midst of Mr. Cleve- 
land's term was overwhelmingly Republican 
and Mr. Reed was again elected speaker by ac- 
clamation. 

In i8g6 Mr. Reed was a candidate for the 
Republican nomination for president and had 
much strength in the east, but the west was 
overwhelmingly for McKinley, who was nom- 
ir.ated. Mr. Reed's name was presented be- 
fore the convention by Senator Henry Cabot 
Lodge, of Massachusetts, and the Hon. 
Charles E. Littlefield, of Maine, made their 
seconding .speech. It was said at the time that 
if Mr. Reed had made certain promises con- 
cerning his cabinet appointments he might 
have had a much stronger following, but he 
absolutely refused to commit himself, prefer- 
ring to lose the prize rather than to tie him- 
self up with pledges in advance. Mr. Reed 
was elected to congress as usual in the fall and 
became speaker again by acclamation. The 



election of Mr. McKinley to the presidency 
made a vacancy in the chairmanship of the 
ways and means committee and to that va- 
cancy Mr. Reed ajipointed Mr. Dingley of this 
state, an apiiointment which aroused no jeal- 
ousies because of the conspicuous fitness of 
Mr. Dingley, though its effect was to give to 
Maine greater prominence in the house than 
any other state in the Union enjoyed. The 
important legislation of this congress was the 
Dingley tariff' bill which continues to be the 
law of the land. When the war with Spain 
was threatening, Mr. Reed was in the speak- 
er's chair and used all his influence to avert it. 
But the blowing up of the Maine had so ex- 
cited the public mind that a collision between 
Spain and the United States was inevitable, 
and all his efforts and those of the president 
and other conservative men of the government 
were unavailing. The war was fought to a 
successful conclusion. Mr. Reed had always 
opposed the acquisition of foreign territory. 
As speaker he had his name called in order to 
vote against the annexation of the Sandwich 
Islands. The annexation of the Philippines 
and Porto Rico was exceedingly distasteful to 
him and he regarded it as a proceeding 
fraught with danger to the future welfare of 
the country. His influence and his vote were 
always against it. Mr. Reed's career in con- 
gress ended with the expiration of the fifty- 
fifth congress. In the fifty-first congress the 
Democrats had refused to vote him the usual 
resolution of thanks, but when the fifty-fifth 
congress expired Mr. Bailey, the Democratic 
leader, presented the following resolution, 
which was passed amid the greatest enthusi- 
asm: "Resolved, That the thanks of the 
House are presented to Hon. Thomas B. Reed, 
Speaker of the House, for the able, impartial 
and dignified manner in which he has presided 
over its deliberations and performed the ardu- 
ous duties of the chairmanship during the 
present term of Congress." 

The feeling engendered by the acrimonious 
debates of the fifty-first congress had passed 
away and all united in paying a deserved tri- 
bute to the speaker. Mr. Reed was elected to 
the fifty-sixth congress, but resigned without 
taking his seat. For many years he had cher- 
ished the purpose to retire from congress and 
practice law in New York, moved thereto 
largely by family considerations, but there had 
never come a time when he could do so with- 
out seriously embarrassing his party. But the 
time had now arrived, where his work being 
done, and being no longer in sympathy with 
the policv of his party in relation to the for- 



40 



STATE OF MAINE. 



eign possessions, he saw a chance to carry out 
his long cherished plan of. retiring to private 
life, and accordingly after consultation with 
his friends, on the twenty-second of August, 
he addressed to the governor a letter of resig- 
nation. The campaign for the nomination of 
his successor was underway when Mr. Reed 
left Portland for his new home in New York. 
Saturday, September i6, before leaving the 
city, he addressed the following to the Re- 
publicans of his district: 

"To the Republicans of the First Maine Dis- 
trict : ^ , 
"While I am naturallv reluctant to obtrude 
myself again upon public attention even here 
at home-^ I am sure no one would expect me 
to leave the First Maine District after so long 
a service without some words expressing to 
you my appreciation of your friendship and 
my gratitude for your generous treatment. 
Words alone are quite inadequate and I must 
appeal to your memories. During three and 
twenty years of political life, not always 
peaceful.' you have never questioned a single 
public act of mine. Other men have had to 
look after their districts, my district has looked 
after me. This in the place where I was born, 
where you know my shortcomings as well as 
I do myself, gives me a right to be proud of 
my relations with you. No honors are ever 
quite like those which come from home. It 
would not be just for me to withhold my 
thanks from those Democrats who have so 
often given me their votes. This friendship 
I can acknowledge with all propriety even in 
a letter to the Republicans, for both they and 
you know that I have never trimmed a sail U> 
catch the passing breeze or even flown a 
doubtful flag. Office as a 'ribbon to stick in 
your coat," is worth nobody's consideration. 
That opportunity you have given me untram- 
melled in the fullest and amplest measure and 
I return you sincere thanks. If I have de- 
served any praise it belongs of right to you. 
Whatever mav happen I am sure that the First 
Maine District will always be true to the prin- 
ciples of libertv, self-government and tlie 
rights of man. ' Thom.\s B. Reed. 
"Portland, September i6, 1899." 
In New York Mr. Reed became the head of 
the law firm of Reed, Simpson, Thatcher & 
Barnum, and he resided in that city engaged m 
the practice of law until his death, December 
7, igo2. Mr. Reed always had a great fond- 
ness for literature, and in the midst of his 
political duties he found time to gratify his 
tastes in this direction. He was a frequent 



contributor to several magazines. He was also 
the author of a work on parliamentary law 
known as Reed's Rules. He was a popular 
after-dinner speaker and was much sought for, 
though he rather avoided taking part in those 
occasions. As a platform orator his speech 
was noted for its clearness and adaptability to 
the common understanding. He rarely shot 
over the heads of his audience and his humor 
was very taking. His convictions were strong 
and held with great tenacity and no one ever 
questioned his honesty of purpose or his thor- 
ough sincerity. He had little familiarity and 
skitl in the arts of the politician, but his suc- 
cesses all came from the strength of his in- 
tellect and character. No one ever thought of 
contesting the nomination in the first district 
with him, and it is safe to say that he could 
have remained in congress up to the day of 
his death had he so desired. Though he had 
been out of public life for three years he con- 
tinued to be one of the most conspicuous figures 
in the country and his words whether spoken or 
written always commanded the attention of his 
countrymen. Mr. Reed went to Washington 
D. C'to attend to some matters in the United 
States supreme court and while there suffered 
from uraemic poisoning which ended his life 
at the Arlington Hotel a week later. He was 
buried in the cemetery in Portland, Maine. 

Thomas B. Reed married, February 5, 1870, 
Susan Prentice, born in New Hampshire, 
daughter of Rev. Samuel H. and Hannah P. 
(Prentice) Merrill, of Portland (see Mer- 
rill). Of their three children the only one 
now surviving is Katharine, born in Portland, 
January 23, 1875, married, June 24, 1905, Cap- 
tain Arthur T. Balantine, of the United States

The Bracketts of Portland 
BRACKETT descended from very an- 
cient ancestry in New 
Hampshire and from forbears who settled in 
Portland, Maine, while it was still known as 
Casco. Nearly all persons named Braciceit 
who reside in either Maine or New Hamp- 
shire, and persons residing elsewhere whose 
forefathers of that name lived in either of 
these states, descended from the immigrant, 
Anthony Brackett, of Portsmouth. 

(I) Anthony Brackett, who tradition states 
was a Scotchman, is supposed to have come to 
Little Harbor, near the mouth of the Pis- 
cataqua river, with the Scotchman, David 
Thompson, as early as 1623. His residence 
before 1649 is supposed to have been in the 
vicinity of Little Harbor and the "Piscatawa" 
house, on what is now called Odiorne's Point.

I'rom 1649 ""til lii*^ dcatli he is known to have 
lived a mile or so south of the harbor, west 
of Sandy beach, on or near the stream, Salt- 
water brook, and on Brackett lane, now lirack- 
ett road. In the year 1649 at a meeting of the 
selectmen, held August 13, it was voted "by 
common consent" to grant a lot of land to 
"Anthiiny ]?rakit," lying between the lands of 
Robert I'udinglon and \\'illiatu Berry "at the 
head of the Sandy Beach I'Vosh Reiver at the 
Western branch thereof." .\t a meeting of the 
inhabitants of the town held January 13, 1652, 
a grant of thirty acres was voted to "Anthony 
Brackite." March 4th following, at a town 
meeting, the selectmen were dirccteil "at the 
next lit time" to lay out the land unto the peo- 
ple at Sandy Beach, vid. unto William Berry, 
Anthony Brackil, Thomas Sevy, Francis Rand 
and James Johnson; March 17, 1653, a grant 
was made of land near Sanely beach by the 
people to various citizens, among whom was 
Anthony Brackett, "upland thirty ackers ad- 
jounge unto his hous and of Meadow 20 ackers 
more." March 20, 1656, he was granted "50 
acres more land than his former grant to join 
with his hous and to lye in such form as it may 
close to his hous so that it be not in any Man's 
former grant." February 3, 1660, 100 acres 
was granted to him as the head of a family 
"who had come to dwell in the town." In all 
he was granted over two hundred acres of 
land. March 31, 1650, he deeded land and 
buildings at .Strawberry Bank (Portsmouth) 
to William Cotton. Perhaps he had lived there 
before 1650. September ig, 1678, he bought 
land at "Sandie Beach from Henry Sher- 
burne." Anthony Brackett was a member of 
the Episcopal church, and was one of the sign- 
ers of a deed of a glebe of fifty acres to the 
church in 1640. He has usually been desig- 
nated as "Anthony the Selectman." March 8. 
165s, he was one of the selectmen for the en- 
suing year. In July following ne signed a 
warrant for collection of a tax to pay the sal- 
ary of the local minister and made his mark 
"A." Some years later he was again chosen 
selectman. His name 'is on the extant lists of 
those taxed to pay the minister's salary 1677- 
88; the tax, eighteen shillings, which he w'as 
assessed for the year 1688, is considerable in 
excess of the average amount of tax paid by 
his townsmen for the same purpose. In 1666 
he subscribed one pound ten shillings toward 
the support of the minister. He w-as one of 
sixty-one settlers who signed a petition in 
1665 when the king's commissioners came to 
settle certain causes of complaint in the col- 
onies. On this petition he writes his name, 



and does not make his mark, as in the former 
case mentioned. The settlers of New Hamp- 
shire were not involved in any way with the 
Indians before 1675. During King Philip's 
war, which began that year, the resident tribes 
of New Hampshire remained on peaceful 
terms with their white neighbors, but the set- 
tlements in Maine were all destroyed, and 
their inhabitants killed, driven away or carried 
captive to Canada. Thomas Brackett, son of 
Anthony, who lived at h'almouth (Portland) 
Maine, was killed in .\ugust, 1676. His chil- 
dren were redeemed from captivity by their 
grandfather, with whom three of them resided 
for several years. In 1691 the depredations 
of the Indians, which had begun two or three 
years before in Maine, reached the settlement 
at Sandy Beach. On Tuesday, September 28, 
1691, a band of Indians descende<l on that 
place and killed twenty-one persons, among 
whom were Anthony Brackett and his wife, 
and captured two children of his son John 
Brackett. The headstones at the graves of 
Anthony and his wife are still to be seen on a 
little knoll in Rye near Saltwater brook. Sep- 
tember II, 1691, only seventeen days before 
his death, Anthony Brackett made his will. 
He disposed of but little real estate by this in- 
strument, as on July 20, 1686, he had deeded 
his farm and buildings at Sandy beach to his 
son John. Anthony Brackett married, about 
1635, and the records show that he was the 
head of a family in 1640. His children were : 
Anthony, Elinor, Tiiomas, Jane and John. 
' (II) Thomas, second son of Anthony 
Brackett, was probably born at Sandy beach, 
then a part of Strawberry Bank (Ports- 
mouth, New Plampshire), now a part of 
the town of Rye, about 1635 or earlier. 
Soon after 1662 he removL-ci to Casco (Port- 
land), Maine. Little is known of him before 
his marriage, after which event he became 
prominent in the town, and was one of the 
selectmen in 1672. His mother-in-law lived 
with him in 1671, during which year he agreed 
to maintain her and in consideration received 
from her a deed of land. This land was situ- 
ated on the southerly side of the upper part 
of the Neck, and had been occupied by 
Michael Milton for several years. The house 
stood near where the Portland gas house now 
is. Thomas was a prosperous and leading 
citizen at the time of his death. While he was 
in office in 1672, his brother Anthony received 
a grant of four hundred acres of land. 

August II, 1676, Indians appeared at Casco 
and captured Captain Anthony Brackett and 
his family, and then divided, a part passing

around Back Cove, and a part upon the Neck. 
The first house in the course of the latter was 
that of Thomas Brackett, on the southerly side 
of the Neck. Between the houses of the two 
Bracketts was a virgin forest. The facts, se- 
lected from the conflicting accounts of the 
events of that day, seem to be that the In- 
dians went along the northerly side of the 
Neck until they had passed the farm of 
Thomas Brackett. In their course they met 
John, the son of George Munjoy, and another, 
Isaac Wakely, and shot them. Others who 
were with or near them fled down the Neck 
to give the alarm, and thereupon the Indians 
retreated in the direction of Thomas Brackett's 
house. That morning three men were on their 
way to Anthony Brackett's to harvest grain. 
They probably rowed over the river from Pur- 
poosuck Point and had left their canoe near 
Thomas Brackett's house. From that place 
they crossed the Neck toward Anthony's 
house, near enough to which they went to learn 
of the attack by the Indians on his family ; the 
three hastened on to the Neck, perhaps over 
the course covered by the Indians, to give the 
alarm. On their way they heard guns fired 
"Whereby it seems two men (perhaps Munjoy 
and Wakely) were killed." Thereupon the 
three fled in the direction of Thomas Brack- 
ett's house to reach their canoe. The Indians 
reached the farm nearly at the same time as 
did the men, who saw Thomas Brackett shot 
down while at work in his field. Two of the 
men succeeded in reaching their canoe ; the 
third, not so fleet of foot, hid in the marsh and 
witnessed the capture of Thomas Brackett's 
wife and children. The three men escaped. 
Among the Indians who were concerned in 
killing of Thomas Brackett was Megunnaway, 
one of the braves of King Philip, who was 
taken and shot by the whites the following 
February. All of the residents on the Neck 
except Thomas Brackett's family, John Mun- 
joy and Isaac Wakely, succeeded in reaching 
Munjoy's garrison house, which stood on 
Munjoy's hill at the end of the Neck. From 
there they passed over to Bang's Island, then 
called Andrew's Island. In this attack the In- 
dians killed, about Casco, eleven men and 
killed or captured twenty-three women and 
children. Thomas Brackett was about forty 
years old at the time of his death. His wife 
is said to have died during the first year of 
her captivity. Their children, as previously 
stated, were ransomed by their grandfather 
Brackett. 

Thomas Brackett married Mary, daughter 
of Michael Milton. Pier mother. Elizabeth 



Milton, was a daughter of George Cheeve, one 
of the most prominent and best known set- 
tlers of Casco. Children of Thomas and Mary 
(Milton) Brackett were: Joshua, Sarah, Sam- 
uel (probably) and Mary. 

(Ill) Lieutenant Joshua, eldest child of 
Thomas and Mary (Milton) Brackett. was 
born in Falmouth, formerly Casco, now Port- 
land. His father was killed by Indians and 
his mother died in captivity while he was still 
a child. After his capture with his mother, 
brother and sisters, August ii, 1676, he re- 
mained a prisoner until redeemed by his grand- 
father, with whom he lived some time after 
returning from Canada. "Probably not until 
the close of the war did he reach his grand- 
father's house at Sandy beach. His mother 
had passed away : all the personal efTects of 
his father had been destroyed ; the farm and. 
large tracts on the Neck alone remained to 
him, and when he arrived at an age to be able 
to cultivate and improve them, war com- 
menced with the Indians, which, but for a 
short interval of peace, lasted for twenty-five 
years. From this condition of privation and 
destitution he rose to become. one of the rich- 
est men in the province in his day." When 
the war of 1688 began he went to Falmouth 
and joined his uncle, Anthony Brackett. He 
was with .Anthony when he fell, and took part 
in the battle which followed the attack. Soon 
afterward he returned to Sandy beach. A 
certificate of service dated April i, 1697, shows 
that Joshua Brackett served as a soldier in 
the garrison at Oyster river (now Durham). 
New Hampshire, four weeks in i6g6. At 
times during the war commencing 1 701 and 
ending in 171 5, he was in the military serv- 
ice as occasion demanded, and was chosen 
lieutenant of a military company. During 
twenty-eight of the first forty-five years of 
his life there was continuous war with the In- 
dians. Of those slain whom he had to mourn 
were his father, grandfather, grandmother, 
uncle, Captain Anthony Brackett, uncle, Na- 
thaniel Milton; uncle. Lieutenant Thadcleus 
Clark; and cousin, Seth Brackett; of his rela- 
tives who were made captives were his mother, 
who died while a prisoner, his brother, two 
sisters, the children of his uncle, John Brack- 
ett, and the children of his uncle, Anthony 
Brackett. There is evidence that he was en- 
gaged in the coast trade, whether as merchant 
or as transporter is not known ; certain it is 
that he was the owner of vessels ; was also 
a manufacturer of lumber, owned a sawmill 
or two, owned one at Wadleigh's Falls in 
Strafiford comity, New Hampshire. Pie pros-

pered and accumulated property in whatever 
branch of business he eutija-^ed. Early in his 
business life he ])urchase(l land and farms 
from their respective owners adjoining one 
another and bordering for miles along the 
southern shore of the Great bay. "These 
lands around the bay were far the best in 
town. And here the prudent Bracketts came 
and settled down." beginning with a' tract 
over the line in Stratham, the farm extended 
into the present town of Greenland, the south- 
ern shore of the bay being its northern limit ; 
it is probably one of the most beautifully sit- 
uated tracts of land in the state. In 1726, 
fifty years after his father's death, he applied 
for administration on his father's property. 
Two years later his sons, Joshua and Anthony, 
took possession of the old farm. About this 
time he became interested in Peak's Island 
and other landed property of the Milton es- 
tate. With his second cousin, Anthony Brack- 
ett, a son of Captain Anthony, "the good pilot 
and captain for his country," of Boston, he 
contested the claim of Rev. Thomas Smith and 
others to the Milton estate, and succeeded in 
fullv establishing his own claim and Anthony's 
and got all but two-ninths of Peak's Island, 
and Joshua purchased Anthony's interest. In 
his will Joshua made to all his sons legacies 
and bequests sufficient to place each in a good 
financial condition. Although Joshua's an- 
cestors on both sides were or are believed to 
have been Episcopalians, he was Congrega- 
tionalist, joining those of that faith when past 
middle age. His children were all baptized 
the day he united with the church. The grave 
of Joshua is on the home farm, and the tomb- 
stone bears the following inscription : "Plere 
Lies Mr. Joshua Brackett Who Died June 19; 
D. y 1749, Aged •]•/ yes." Joshua Brackett 
married j\lary Weeks, born July ig, 1676, died 
in 1740, daughter of Leonard Weeks, who 
married Mary Haines, daughter of Samuel 
Haines, who was born about 161 1, in England, 
and died in i686; his wife was Elinor Neate. 
Their children were: John, Joshua, Thomas, 
Samuel, Anthony, Mary (died young), Abi- 
gail, Eleanor, James, Mary, Keziah, Margaret 
and Nathaniel. 

(IV) Anthony, fifth son of Joshua and 
Mary (Weeks) Brackett, was born in Green- 
land, New Hampshire, January 25, 1708. At 
eleven years of age he went to Falmouth to 
live. His father. Joshua Brackett, secured 
title to the large tract of land on the Neck, 
which he claimed as heir to his parents, and 
in the peaceful time following 1725 Anthony 
and his brother Joshua went to Falmouth and 



took possession of it. ( )n the Neck Anthony 
had, in addition to other tracts, a farm on 
which he resided, which during his life much 
increased in value. He also owned the greater 
and more valuable portion of Peak's Island, 
and this he conveyed shortly before his death 
to his .son Thomas ; he also conveyed to him 
and to third [)arties tracts of land including 
the homesteatl. As his wife did not join in 
the conveyance of this property, in later years 
and up to a very recent date, the descendants 
of Anthony labored under the delusion that 
they might recover the land thus conveyed, 
now in the city of Portland and of great 
value. 

Anthony and his brother Joshua were prom- 
inent in Falmouth in social and business af- 
fairs. Their estates extended from one side 
of the Neck to the other near its base. The 
house of Anthony stood at the corner of Dan- 
forth and Brackett streets in Portland, which 
latter street ran through his farm. The dwell- 
ing house of two stories, mentioned as the 
mansion house, faced the south ; in front of it 
was an orchard on the slope of a hill. Joshua's 
house stood on Congress street near High 
street. This house, which w-as burned after 
his death, he built after he had resided for 
some years in a log house which stood where 
Gray street is. At the time of Anthony's mar- 
riage in 1733, the brothers lived in this log 
house. Their residence in Falmouth began in 
1728. Between their houses was a swamp 
through which was a footpath. The division 
line between their estates was along Grove 
and Congress streets. Anthony's land in- 
cluded nearly all that on the southeast side 
of Congress street from about opposite Casco 
to Vaughn street, and a lot of nearly fifty 
acres on the westerly side of Grove street, run- 
ning from Congress street to the poor farm. 
Joshua's land lay on the northwest side of 
Congress street, extending from Grove street 
easterly. The houses of the brothers, on the 
outskirts of the settlement, were in an exposed 
position, and hostile Indians were seen in the 
swamp and near their houses on more than 
one occasion during the years 1744 to 1748, 
and a few years following 1755; but none of 
their buildings were burned, and no member 
of their families is known to have been 
harmed. Perhaps their escape from any dam- 
age was due to their preparedness and ability 
to protect themselves from foes. On the roll 
of Captain James Milk's company, under date 
of May 10, 1757, appears the name of An- 
thony ; in the alarm list of that company ap- 
pears the name of Joshua. The latter was 



44 



STATE OF MAINE. 



the older of the two ; though at the time An- 
thony was fifty years of age, he was not too 
old for active duty in those days, while Joshua 
was available when the alarm was given of an 
expected attack by Indians. Anthony died 
September lo, 1784, aged seventy-seven, and 
was buried on his farm in what later became 
Summer street. His remains were later re- 
moved to the Brackett cemetery on Peak's 
Island. 

Anthony Brackett married (first) in the 
First Congregational Church of Scarborough, 
Maine, by Rev. William Sergeant, Sarah 
Knight, February 14, 1734. Six children 
were born of this union. He married (sec- 
ond) Kerenhappuck Hicks, whose maiden 
name was Proctor, daughter of Samuel and 
Sarah (Brackett) Proctor. Their intentions 
of marriage were published November 5, 1756. 
After the death of her husband, rooms in the 
mansion house were set apart for her use 
which she occupied for a few years, and then 
went to reside in Gorham, where she died at 
the home of a son of her daughter, Meribah, 
in 1822. The children of Anthony Brackett 
were: John, Sarah, Thomas, James, Eliza- 
beth, Anthony, Meribah, Joshua, Keziah, Sam- 
uel and Nathaniel. 

(V) Tliomas (2), second son of Anthony 
(2) and Sarah (Knight) Brackett, was born in 
Falmouth in May, 174-I, died December 13. 
181 3. He was the owner of a large estate, a 
farmer and also engaged in otlier pursuits. 
His father deeded him nearly all the estate 
which he had on the Neck and also the greater 
portion of Peak's Island. He resided on the 
island from an early date, and probably dwelt 
there during the revolutionary war. At that 
time there were only three dwellings on the 
island. When Captain Henry IMowatt with a 
British fleet on October 16, 1775, arrived at 
Portland harbor, he anchored near Peak's 
Island, in Hog roads, between Hog and House 
islands and in sight of Thomas Brackett's 
house. Thomas Brackett married, December 

9, 1762, Jane Hall, born in 1740, died May 

10, 1810, daughter of Cornelius and Elizabeth 
(White) Hall, of Cherryfield. Children: 
John, Elizabeth, Sally, Patience, and Mary, 
next mentioned. 

(VI) Mary, youngest child of Thomas and 
Jane (Hall) Brackett, was baptized June 9, 
1776, and died November 13, i860. Her 
father .sold her two acres of land in front of 
the present Mineral Spring House, Peak's 
Island. This house, which may have been 
built by her father, was her residence. She 
married, November 10, 1796, Joseph Reed, 



who died April i, 1852. They were the grand- 
parents of the famous statesman Thomas 
Brackett Reed. (See Reed.) 



In the re<:;istries of the coun- 
BURRAGE ties of Suffolk, Essex and 

Norfolk, England, the name 
of Burrage occurs so frequently in the six- 
teenth century as to indicate that the family 
was a numerous one among the landholders 
of the middle or yeoman class. The name is 
spelled Burgh, Burough, Borough, Borage, 
Bearadge, Burrish, Beridge, Burrage, etc. 

(I) The line of the New England family 
of this name is easily traced back to Robert 
Burrage (Burrishe), of Seething, a small par- 
ish near Norton Subcourse, and nine miles 
south of Norwich. In 1901 it had a population 
of two hundred and eighty-four. Robert Bur- 
rage married Rose , by whom he had 

two sons, Robert (married Amy Cooke, died 
December 3, 1598), and Richard, and one 

■ daughter ^largery. 

(II) Richard, youngest son of Robert and 
Rose Burrage, took up his residence in Nor- 
ton Subcourse, a widely scattered village ten 
or twelve miles southeast of Norwich, with a 
population at the present time of a little more 
than three hundred. The village church was 
erected in 1387. Richard Burrage married, 
but the name of his wife is not known. Nine 
children were born to them, seven sons and 
two daughters : Henry, Richard, Thomas, 
Anne, Elizabeth, John, John, Owen, Anthony. 

(III) Thomas, the third son of Richard 
Burrage, was born at Norton Subcourse, Feb- 
ruary 28, 15S1. August ig, 1606, he was 
married to Frances Dey, by whom he had 
seven children, two sons anvi five daughters-: 
Mary, Margaret, Grace, Letitia, John, Hei 
and Anna. Thomas Burrage died March 2, 
1632, leaving all his property to his wife while 
she lived, with a provision that in case of her 
death the estate should go to his oldest son 
John, after paying certain legacies to his 
brother Henry and his sisters "Marie," "Mar- 
garet" and "Anne." 

(IV) John, oldest son of Thomas and 
Frances (Dey) Burrage, was sixteen years 
old when his father died. It is thought that he 
remained at home until he attained his ma- 
jority in the spring of 1637. All England at 
that time was bordering on revolution, and 
many, even more in preceding years, were 
seeking homes in the new world. One occa- 
sion for the unrest at this time was the ship- 
money tax demanded by the government from 
the inland as well as the maritime counties.

the people, hroiiglil Ijofoie tlie judges of the 
exchequer clianibcr toward the close of 1636. 
Their ilecision greatl\- exasperated the people, 
and addetl to the general unrest. Bromfield, 
in his "History of Norfolk County," says : 
"At this time ( 1634) John Burridge, Gent, 
of Norwich, for refusing to pay five pounds 
assessed upon him towards the ship, was com- 
mitted to prison, but on payment was dis- 
charged. The ship-money was the beginning 
of trouble." It was evidently because of this 
unrest that John Burrage decided to leave 
Norton Subcourse, and make for himself a 
home in the new England across the sea. 
What share of his father's estate he brought 
with him, or in what vessel he sailed, is not 
known. The first new-world record concern- 
ing him is found in the town records of 
Charlestown, Massachusetts, under date of 
1637, as follows : "John Burrage, hath liberty 
to take John Charles' house lott by goodman 
Blotts. Good Thos Line had yielded him the 
house lott before good Charles in case Elias 
Maverick flid refuse it or leave it." ■ In the 
following year, in a record of the possessions 
of the inhabitants of Charlestown, occurs a 
record concerning the possessions of John Bur- 
rage, showing that he had not only a house 
and garden lot in Charlestown, but several 
parcels of land outside of that place. In 
Charlestown, or vicinity, he found his wife, 

Mary , probably about 1639. May 18, 

1642, he took the freeman's oath, having quali- 
fied for this by uniting with the First Church 
in Charlestown, May 10, 1642. With this 
church his wife united a year before. There 
is no record of her death, but it was subse- 
quent to 1646 and prior to 1654. In the year 
1654, or early in 1655, he married Joanna 
Stowers, daughter of Nicholas and Amy Stow- 
ers, who were of the thirty-five persons dis- 
missed from the church in Boston in 1632, 
forming the First Church in Charlestown. 
Nicholas Stowers died May 17, 1646, and his 
wife Amy died in 1667-68. John Burrage 
died October 19, 1685, leaving an estate valued 
at £246 8s. 3d. above indebtedness. His widow 
Joanna died December 25, 1689. He had 
three children, as follows: By Mary, his first 
wife: Mary, born March 8, 1640, married 
John Marshall, of Billerica ; died November 
30, 1680. Hannah, born November 14, 1643, 
married John French, of Billerica; died July 
17, 1667. Elizabeth, married (first) Thomas 
Doane ; (second) John Poor, both of Charles- 
town. John, born 1646, married, June 15,

and decoration of bellows ; and later still he 
became a manufacturer of varnish. As his 
business increased he removed to Cambridge- 
port, where he manufactured varnish for 
wholesale dealers in Boston. After a few 
years of business success, he purchased in 
Leominster the homestead of his uncle, Will- 
iam Burrage, and removed his family there, 
while continuing his business as a manufac- 
turer of varnish in Brighton. His business in- 
terests compelled him at length to give up the 
homestead property, and he made his residence 
in Roxbury thenceforward, continuing the 
manufacture of varnish there until his death, 
July 5, 1854, at the age of forty-nine years. 
Industrious, energetic, kindhearted, he pos- 
sessed the genial, sanguine temperament of his 
father ; and though diligent in business he 
took an active interest in the religious and po- 
litical movements of the day. In the list of 
members of the Fitchburg Philosophical So- 
ciety in 1830, his name is found among the 
names of the prominent men in the town at 
that time. His children were as follows : By 
his first wife, Sarah (Downe) Burrage: 
Leonard Downe, born June 26, 1832. By his 
second wife, Mary Thurston (Upton) Bur- 
rage, daughter of Joseph Upton, of Fitch- 
burg, the children were : Thomas Fairbanks, 
born July 4, 1834. Henry Sweetser, born 
January 7, 1837. William Upton, born De- 
cember 22, 1838, died August 12, 1839. Ed- 
win Augustus, born November 21, 1840, died 
September 15, 1841. By his third wife, Sarah 
T. ( Farnum ) Burrage, the children were : 
Mary Abigail, born November 10, 1842. 
Sarah Elizabeth Tilton, born November 2, 
1844. Martha Sophronia, born December 22, 
1846. Harriet Adeline, born March 2, 1851. 

(X) Leonard Downe, only son of Jonathan 
and Sarah (Downe) Burrage, born in Fitch- 
burg, June 26, 1832, attended the schools in 
Fitchburg and Cambridge, and then engaged 
in business, being associated with his father 
in the manufacture and sale of varnish. When 
about twenty-one years of age, while on a 
business trip to New York, he stopped in 
Springfield, Massachusetts, made sales, and 
was not again heard from. No further trace 
of him could be found, though diligent search 
was made. He was a young man of the most 
exemplary habits, of great promise, and noth- 
ing in connection with his mysterious disap- 
pearance has ever been revealed. 

(X) Thomas Fairbanks, oldest son of Jona- 
than and Mary T. (Upton) Burrage, born in 
Fitchburg, ^Massachusetts, July 4, 1834, suc- 
ceeded in 1854 to his father's business as a 



manufacturer of varnish, and was happily set- 
tled in Roxbury, Jvlassachusetts, when the 
civil war opened. His family and business re- 
lations alone restrained him from entering the 
military service at- the beginning of the con- 
flict. But as the call for more men became 
urgent, he at length found himself unable to 
turn a deaf ear to what he believed to be the 
call of duty, and July 29, 1862, he wrote: 
"The time has come when I can no longer en- 
joy the peace and comfort of my pleasant 
home without a sense of shame and dishonor. 
My country calls for my aid and I cannot with- 
hold it." He accordingly enlisted as a private 
in Company C, Forty-first Massachusetts Vol- 
unteer Infantry, and soon was appointed ser- 
geant. The regiment when organized and 
equipped was ordered to the Department of 
the Gulf, and landed at Baton Rouge, Louisi- 
ana, December 17, 1862. While in camp there 
he was taken ill and removed to the hospital. 
Not long ^fter a forward movement was 
thought to be impending, and without having 
fully recovered he returned to his regiment. 
Again he was ordered to the hospital, and 
again impatient to be with the regiment, he 
asked the privilege of returning. This was 
unwisely granted. The disease had fastened 
itself so strongly upon him that further medi- 
cal aid was unavailing, and he died in the hos- 
pital at Baton Rouge, April 29, 1863. The 
officers of his regiment bore beautiful testi- 
mony to his worth as a man and a soldier, as 
also did his fellow citizens at home. In the 
following winter the remains were brought to 
Roxbury, and after fitting funeral services, 
were laid to rest in Forest Hills cemetery. His 
children were as follows : Henry Thompson, 
born October 27, 1857. William Edwin, born 
July 15, 1859. Charles Albert, born Septem- 
ber 20, i860, died September 25, i860. Henry 
Thompson Burrage is an engineer connected 
with the office of the city engineer of Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts. William Edwin Bur- 
rage is secretary and treasurer of the Cam- 
bridge Mutual Fire Insurance Company, Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts. 

(X) Henry Sweetser, second son of Jona- 
than and Mary T. (LIpton) Burrage, born in 
Fitchburg, Januarv' 7, 1837, after his father's 
removal to Roxbury attended the Chauncey 
Hall School in Boston. Later he fitted for 
college at Pierce Academy at Middleboro, 
Massachusetts, and entered Brown University 
in the autumn of 1857. He w'as graduated in 
1861 with Phi Beta Kappa rank, and was the 
first of his class. In the fall of 1861 he en- 
tered Newton Theological Institution at New- 



STATJ'I Dl- MAINE.

ton Center, Massachusetts, with the Christian 
ministry in view ; but he iiad completed only 
one year of his course when the urgent call of 
President Lincoln for more men, which had 
stirred so ileeply the heart of his brother 
Thomas, stirred his heart, and he asked and 
obtained from the Theological Institution a 
leave of absence in order to enter the military 
service. August i, 1862, while visiting rela- 
tives in Fitchburg, he enlisted as a private in 
Company A, Thirty-sixth Massachusetts \'ol- 
unleer Infantry. In a few days he was made 
a sergeant, and before the regiment left the 
stale he received an appointment as sergeant- 
major. The regiment left for the seat of war 
September 2, and on its arrival in Washing- 
ton was assigned to the Ninth Corps, then with 
the Army of the Potomac. After service in 
that army the corps was transferred to the 
west and was with Crant at \ icksburg, after- 
ward with Sherman in the Jackson campaign, 
later in East Tennessee and at the siege of 
Knoxvillc. Returning with the corps again 
to Virginia in the spring of 1864, Sergeant- 
Alajor Burrage, who meanwhile had been 
commissioned second lieutenant and first lieu- 
tenant, was wounded in the right shoulder at 
Cold Harbor, June 3, and while he was at 
home on account of his wound he v.'as com- 
missioned captain. Returning to his regiment 
in September, he was captured at Petersburg, 
November i, and was a prisoner at Richmond 
and Danville until February 22, 1865. His 
last service was as acting adjutant general on 
the stafif of General John I. Curtin, command- 
ing the First Brigade, Second Division, Ninth 
-Army Corps. After the great review in Wash- 
ington, he returned to Massachusetts with his 
regiment, and was mustered out of the service 
June 8, 1865. March 13, 1865, he was 
brevetted major of the United States Volun- 
teers "for gallant and meritorious services in 
the campaign from the Rapidan to the James." 
In the autumn of 1865 he resumed his studies 
at Newton, and was graduated with the class 
of 1867. While at Newton he prepared and 
published "Brown University in the Civil 
War." He then went to Germany for the pur- 
pose of continuing his theological studies at 
the University at Halle. Returning to this 
country in 1869, lie accepted a call to the pas- 
torate of the Baptist church in Waterville, 
Maine, where he remained until October, 1873, 
when he returned to Portland, and became 
editor and proprietor of Zion's Advocate. 
While engaged in editorial work, he pub- 
lished in 1879 "The Act of Baptism in the 
History of the Christian Church." in 1882, ".\ 



Histor} of the Anabaptists of Switzerland," 
in 1887, "Rosicr's Relation of Waymoutii's 
Voyage to the Coast of Maine in 1605," with 
introductions and notes; in 1888, "Baptist 
Hymn W' riters and Tlieir Hymns" ; in 1894, 
"A History of the Baptists in New England"; 
in 190^, "History of the Baptists in Maine." 
He was also the author of many historical 
papers contributed to magazines and reviews, 
etc. For more than a quarter of a century he 
was the recording secretary of the American 
Baptist Missionary Union, and for about the 
same length of time he was recording secre- 
tary of the Maine Baptist Missionary Conven- 
tion. He was for many years the secretary of 
the Maine Society of the .Sons of the American

Colby College), and a well-known author of 
college textbooks. Through his grandfather 
and grandmother, Champlin Burrage is con- 
nected with many Rhode Island families. He 
prepared for college at the Portland high 
school, and at graduation received one of the 
Brown medals. He next entered Brown Uni- 
versity, and was graduated with the class of 
1896. During his university course he was 
for two years an editor of the Brunonian. was 
elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa So- 
ciety (first division), and at his graduation 
received the medal of the Rhode Island So-

Development of the Church Covenant Idea." 
This was published in 1904. Meanwhile he 
returned to England for other research work 
in various libraries of Cambridge, Oxford, 
London, etc., and for three successive years 
he held the foreign research fellowship of 
Newton Theological Institution. In the course

Press, he published "The True Story of Rob- 
ert Browne," and in i(P7, also at the same 
Press, he published "The 'Retractation' of Rob- 
ert Browne." The new material contained in 
these publications has compelled the almost 
entire rewriting of Browne's life. Mr. Bur- 
rage married at Oxford, England, September 
3, 1907, Florence Dwight Dale, daughter of 
Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Dana Dale, of ]\Iont-

Tlic lineage of a very large 
PUTNAM part of I'utnams of New Kng- 

laiul is traced to John rutnani, 
tile immigrant, the ancestor of several promi- 
nent citizens of the early days of Massachu- 
setts. The name comes from I'uttenham, a 
place in England, and this perhaps from the 
Flemish word piitte, "a well," plural puttcn 
and IhiiH. signifying a "home," and the whole 
indicating a settlement h)- a well. Some four 
or five years after the settlement of Salem, 
Massachusetts, it became necessary to extend 
the area of the town in order to accommodate 
a large number of immigrants who were de- 
sirous of locating within its jurisdiction, and 
as a consequence farming communities were 
established at various points, some of them 
being considerable distance from the center of 
population. Several families newly arrived 
from England founded a settlement which 
they called Salem X'illage, and the place was 
known as such for more than a hundred 
years. It is now called Danvers. Among the 
original settlers of Salem Village was John 
Putnam. He was the American progenitor of 
the Putnams in New England, and among his 
descendants were the distinguished revolution- 
ary generals, Israel and Rufus Putnam. Much 
valuable information relative to the early his- 
torv of the family is to be found in the "Essex 
Institute Collection." In common with most 
of the inhabitants, they suffered from the 
witchcraft delusion but were not seriously af- 
fected. 

(I) The first ancestor of whom definite 
knowledge is obtainable is Rodger a tenant of 
Pultenham in 1086. 

(II) The second generation is represented 
by Galo of the same locality. 

(III) Richard, born 1154, died 1189, pre- 
sented the living of the church of Puttenham 
to the prior and canons of Ashby. 

(R') Simon de Puttenham was a knight of 
Herts in 1199. 

(V) Ralph de Puttenham a juryman in 
1 199 held a knight's fee in Puttenham of the 
honor of Leicester in 1210-12. 

(\I) William de Puttenham is the next in 
line. 

(YH) John de Puttenham was lord of the 
manor of Puttenham in 1291 and was a son 
of William. His wife "Lady of Puttenham, 
held half a knight's fee in Puttenham of the 
honor of Wallingford in 1303." 

(VIII) Sir Rodger de Puttenham, son of 
the Lady of Puttenham, was born prior to 
1272, and with his wife Alina had a grant of 
lands in Penne in 131 5. He was sheriff of 



Herts in 1322, in which year he supported Ed- 
w^ard II against the Mortimers. His wife, 
perhaps identical with Helen, is called a daugh- 
ter of John Spigornel, and was married (sec- 
ond) to Thomas de la Hay, King's commis- 
sioner, knight of tlie sheer, in 1337, who 
held Puttenham with reversion to the heirs 
of Rodger Puttenham, and land in Penne in 
right of his wife. 

(IX) Sir Rodger de Puttenham was par- 
doned by the king in 1338, probably on ac- 
count of some political offense. The next 
year he was a follower of Sir John de Molyns, 
and was knight of the sheer from 1355 to 
1374. He had a grant of remainder after the 
death of Christian Bordolfe of the manor of 
Long Marston, in 1370-71. He had a second 
wife, Marjorie, in 1370. 

(X) Robert, son of Sir Rodger de Putten- 
ham, in 1346, held part of a knight's fee in 
Marston, which the Lady of Puttenham held. 
He was living in 1356. 

(XI) William, son of Robert de Puttenham 
of Puttenham and Penne, was commissioner 
of the peace for Herts in 1377, and was called 
"of Berk Hampstead." He was sergeant-at- 
arms in 1376. He married Margaret, daugh- 
ter of John de Warbleton, who died in 1375, 
when his estates of Warbleton, Sherfield, etc., 
passed to the Putnams. They had children: 
Henry, Robert and William. 

(X'll) Henry, son of William and Margaret 
(Warbleton) de Puttenham, was near sixty 
years of age in 1468, and died July 6, 1473. 
He married Elizabeth, widow of Jeffrey Good- 
luck, who died in i486, and was probably his 
second wife. 

(XIII) William, eldest son of Henry Put- 
tenham, was in possession of Puttenham, 
Penne, Sherfield and other estates. He was 
buried in London, and his will was proved 
Julv 23, 1492. He married Anne, daughter of 
John Hampden, of Hampden, who was living 
in i486. They had sons: Sir George, Thom- 
as and Nicholas. 

(XIV) Nicholas, third son of William and 
Ann Puttenham, and Penne, in 1534, bore the 
same arms as his elder brother, Sir George. 
He had sons : John and Henry. 

(XV) Henry, younger son of Nicholas Put- 
nam, was named in the will of his brother 
John, in 1526. 

(XVI) Richard, son of Henry Putnam, was 
of Eddelsboro in 1524, and owned land in 
Slapton. His will was proved February 26, 
1557, and he left a widow Joan. He had sons : 
Harry and John. 

(X'\'II) John, second son of Richard and 



STATE OF MAINE. 



Joan Putnam, of Wingrave and Slapton, was 
buried October 2, 1573, and his will was 
proved November 14 following. His wife 
Margaret was buried January 27, 1668. They 
had sons; Nicholas, Richard, Thomas and 
John. 

(XVTII) Nicholas, eldest son of John and 
Margaret Putnam, of Windgrave and Stuke- 
ley, died before September 27, 1598, on which 
date his will was proved. His wife Margaret 
was a daughter of John Goodspeed. She mar- 
ried (second) in 1614, William Huxley, and 
died January 8, 1619. They had children: 
John, Anne, Elizabeth, Thomas and Richard. 

(I) John, eldest son of Nicholas and Mar- 
garet (Goodspeed) Putnam, was of the nine- 
teenth generation in the English line, and first 
of the American line. He was born about 
1580, and died suddenly in Salem Village, now 
Danvers, Massachusetts, December 30, 1662, 
aged about eighty years. It is known that he 
was resident of Aston Abbotts, England, as 
late as 1627, as the date of the baptism of the 
youngest son shows, but just when he came 
to New England is not known. Family tra- 
dition is responsible for the date 1634, and 
the tradition is known to have been in the 
family over one hundred and fifty years. In 
1 64 1, new style, John Putnam was granted 
land in Salem. He was a farmer and exceed- 
ingly well oiT for those times. He wrote a 
fair hand, as deeds on file show. In these 
deeds he styled himself "yeoman" ; once, in 
1655, "husbandman." His land amounted to 
two hundred and fifty acres, and was situated 
between Davenport's hill and Potter's hill. 
John Putnam was admitted to the church in 
1647, six years later than his wife, and was 
also a freeman the same year. The town of 
Salem in 1 6.^14 voted that a patrol of two men 
be appointed each Lord's day to walk forth 
during worship and take notice of such who 
did not attend service and who were idle, etc., 
and to present such cases to the magistrate ; all 
of those appointed were men of standing in 
the community. For the ninth dav John Put- 
nam and John Hathorne were appointed. The 
following account of the death of John Put- 
nam was written in 1733 by his grandson Ed- 
ward : "He ate his supper, went to prayer with 
his family and died before he went to sleep." 
He married, -in England, Priscilla (perhaps 
Gould), who was admitted to the church in 
Salem in 1641. Their children, baptized at 
Aston Abbotts, were: Elizabeth; Thomas, 
grandfather of General Israel Putnam, of the 
revolutionary war; John. Nathaniel, .Sara, 
Phoebe and John.

He erected a dwelling house on the Topsfield 
road, not far from his father's homestead, and 
it is recorded that he was a farmer in ex- 
cellent circumstances. He married (first) 
Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth 
Whipple. She died in early womanhood, and 
the oldest inscription in the Wadsworth bury- 
ing-grornd reads as follows : "Here lyes the 
body of Elizabeth, ye wife of Jonathan Put- 
nam, aged about 22 years ; Deceased ye 7th of 
August, 1682." Jonathan married (second) 
Lydia, daughter of Anthony and Elizabeth 
(Whipple) Potter, of Ipswich, 2^Iassachusetts. 
Her will was made September 14, 1742, and 
proved April 8, 1745. His first wife bore him 
one son, Samuel, who died in infancy. The 
children of his second union were : Lydia, 
Elizabeth. Ruth, Susanna, Jonathan, Esther,

year he reenlisted in Colonel Plaisted's regi- 
ment. As a member of Captain Jeremiah 
Paige's company he responded to the Lexing- 
ton alarm, April 19, 1775, and May 11 of that 
year he enlisted in the continental army as a 
sergeant. He was subsequently promoted to 
the rank of ensign, and while serving as such 
in the disastrous operations on Long Island 
under Colonel Hutchinson, he was taken pris- 
oner by the British. He was finally mustered 
out with the rank of captain, having attained 
the record of being a brave and efficient officer. 
His gravestone in the Plains cemetery at Dan- 
vers bears the following inscription : "Captain

ried Rachel Fuller; children: Thomas, Eunice,

(\'II) Captain Thomas, eldest child of Cap- 
tain Jeremiah and Rachel (F"uller) Putnam. 
was born in Danvers, October 8, 1763. As a 
youth he went to sea, and becoming a master 
mariner, was for many years in command of 
vessels hailing from Salem. He died in Dan- 
vers January 22, 1822. He was a member of the 
Salem Marine Society. He married Mary 
Fitts, of Ipswich, Massachusetts (baptized 
May 15, 1763), daughter of James and Alary 
(Dutch) Fitts. She was a descendant in the 
sixth generation of Robert Fitts through (II) 
Abraham, (III) Richard, (IV) Isaac, (V) 
James. Robert Fitts, an immigrant from Eng- 
land, was one of the first settlers in Salisbury, 
Massachusetts, going there in 1640 and re- 
ceiving land grants. In 1662 he removed to

Dr. Putnam resided in York about fifty-six 
years, of which fifty-four were spent in the

which Mr. Putnam is treasurer. He opened 
a cafe in York in 1888, furnishing chiefly 
ice cream and confectionery. Mr. Putnam 
is interested in various business enterprises 
and has taken an active part in encouraging 
the growth of the town as a summer resort. 
In company with Mr. F. \'arrell he has erected 
a large number of handsome cottages for the 
accommodation of summer guests. He bought 
out the general store of Varrell Brothers, and 
this has been incorporated under the name 
of the Putnam Grocery Company. He is a 
Republican in his political affiliations, and is a 
member of the town committee. He was ap- 
pointed postmaster at York Harbor in 1897, 
and has held that position since that time. He 
is also tax collector of the York Village Cor- 
poration. He is a member of St. Aspinquid

(ID Nathaniel, third son of 
PUTNAM John and Priscilla Putnam, 
was baptized at Aston Abbotts, 
October 11, 1619, and died at Salem Milage, 
July 23, 1700. He was a man of considerable 
landed property ; his wife brought him seventy- 
five acres additional, and on this tract he built 
his house and established himself. Part of 
his property has remained uninterruptedly in 
the family. It is now better known as the 
"old Judge Putnam place." He was constable 
in 1656, and afterwards deputy to the general

front on all local (|uesliuns, whether pertain- 
int^ to politics, religious affairs, or otlicr town 
mailers. "lie iiad great business activity and 
ability, and was a pcr.son of extraordinary 
powers of mind, of great energy and skill in 
the management of affairs, and of singular 
sagacity, acumen and quickness of perception. 
He left a large estate." Nathaniel Putnam was 
one of the princii)als in the great lawsuit con- 
cerning the ownership of the Bishop farm. 
His action in this matter was merely to pre- 
vent the attempt of Zerubabel Endicott to 
push the bounds of the Bishop grant over his 
land. The case was a long and complicated 
affair, and was at last settled to the satisfac- 
tion of -Allen and Putnam in 1683. December 
10. 1688, Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam was 
one of the four messengers sent to Rev. Sam- 
uel Parris to obtain his reply to the call of the 
parish,. Parris was afterwards installed as 
the minister of the parish, and four years 
later completely deceived Mr. Putnam in re- 
gard to the witchcraft delusion. That he hon- 
estly believed in witchcraft and in the state- 
m.ents of the afflicted girls there seems to be 
no doubt ; that he was not inclined to be 
severe is evident, and his goodness of charac- 
ter shows forth in marked contrast with the 
almost bitter feeling shown by many of those 
concerned. He lived to see the mistake he had 
made. That he should have believed in the 
ilelusion is not strange, for belief in witchcraft 
was then all but universal. The physicians 
and ministers called upon to examine the girls, 
who pretended to be bewitched, agreed that 
such was the fact. Upham states tliat ninety- 
nine out of every one hundred in Salem be- 
lieved that such was the case. There can be 
no doubt that the expressed opinion of a man 
like Nathaniel Putnam must have influenced 
scores of his neighbors. His eldest brother 
had been dead seven years, and he had suc- 
ceeded to the position as head of the great 
Putnam family with its connections. He was 
known as "Landlord Putnam," a term given 
for many years to the oldest living member of 
the family. He saw the family of his brother 
Thomas Putnam afflicted, and being an upright 
and honest man himself, believed in the dis- 
ordered imaginings of his grandniece, Ann. 
These are powerful reasons to account for 
his belief and actions. The following extract 
from Upham brings out the better side of his 
character : "Entire confidence was felt by all 
in his judgment, and deservedly. But he was 
a strong religionist, a lifelong member of the 
church, and extremely strenuous and zealous 



in his ecclesiastical relations. He was getting 
to be an old man, and Mr. Parris had wholly 
succeeded in obtaining, for the time, posses- 
sion of his feelings, sympathy and zeal in the 
management of the church, and secured his 
full co-operation in the witchcraft prosecu- 
tions. I-fe had been led by Parris to take the 
very front in the proceedings. But even Na- 
thaniel Putnam could not stand by in silence 
and see Rebecca Nurse sacrificed. .\ curious 
paper written by him is among those which 
have been preserved : "Nathaniel Putnam, 
senior, being desired by Francis Nurse, Sr., to 
give information of what 1 could say con- 
cerning his wife's liie and conversation. 1, 
the above said, have known this said afort*- 
said woman forty years, and what 1 have ob- 
served of her, human frailties excepted, her 
life and conversation have been to her pro- 
fession, and she hath brought up a great family 
of children and educated them well, so that 
there is in some of them apparent savor of 
godliness. 1 have known her differ with her 
neigh.bors, but I never knew or heard of any 
that did accuse her of what she is now charged 
vvith." 

In 1694 Nathaniel and John Putnam testified 
to having livetl in the village since 1641. He 
married, in Salem, Elizabeth, daughter of 
Richard and Alice (Boswortli) Hutchinson, of 
Salem Village. She was born August 20, and 
baptized at Arnold, England, August 30, 1629, 
and died June 24, 1688. In 1648 both Nathan- 
iel and his wife Elizabeth were admitted to the 
church in Salem. Their children, all born in 
Salem, were : Samuel, Nathaniel, John, Jo- 
seph, Elizabeth, Benjamin and Mary. 

(Ill) Captain Benjamin, youngest son of 
Nathaniel and Elizabeth (Hutchinson) Put- 
nam, was born December 24, 1664, at Salem 
Village, and died at the same place about 
1715. He was a prominent man in Salem and 
held many town offices, being tythingman at 
the village in 1695-96, and constable and col- 
lector in 1700, and was selectman in 1707- 
1713, and was often on the grand and petit 
juries. He was chosen to perambulate the 
bounds between the towns of Salem and Tops- 
field, which was his last appearance on the 
records, in 1712. He held the position .of 
lieutenant and captain, was in the Indian war, 
and received the titles in 1706-1711. It ap- 
pears that he was imprisoned at one time, but 
for what cause does not appear. Among the 
signatures to the certificate of character of 
Rebecca Nurse, the names of Benjamin and 
his wife Sarah appears. Rev. Joseph Green, 
in his diary, mentions calling on "Landlord

Putnam" and that he was very sick and out 
of his head. December 30, 1709, he was 
chosen deacon of the church of the village. 
His will, dated October 28, 1706, was proved 
April 25, 1715. He gives to his son (minis- 
ter at Readhig) "one hundred and tifty pounds 
for his learning," "Overseers, Uncle John 
Putnam and Captain Jonathan Putnam." All 
his children but Josiah are mentioned. He 
was married August 25, 1686, to Elizabeth, 
daughter of Thomas Putnam (according to 
Colonel Perley Putnam), but on the Salem 
rcconls the births are recorded as by wife 
Plannah. tlis first wife died December 21, 
L70S, and he married (second) July i, 1706, 
Sarah Holton. His children were: Josiah, 
Nathaniel, Tarrant, Elizabeth, Benjamin,

pioneer of Wilton, New Hampshire, and prob- 
ably located there in 1738, for in June, 1739, 
Ephraim and Jacob Putnam and John Dole, 
all of Danvers,"made the first permanent settle- 
ment in Wilton. For three years his wife was 
the only white woman living in the town, and 
during one winter the snow was so deep and 
neighbors so far away that she saw no one out- 
side her family for six months. The brothers 
Jacob, Ephraim and Nathaniel were all early 
settlers at Wilton, but finding the Indians 
troublesome they returned to Danvers, and a 
second time settled at Wilton and Lyndebor- 
ough. He was a man of great energy, and at 
one time operated a sawmill beside working 
on his farm, and in his later years made cans. 
He married (first) in July, 1735, Susanna 
Harriman, of Danvers, (second) Susanna

vember 27, 1806, at the same place. He was

sponded to the alarm of April 19, 1775, and

(VII) Henry (2), son of Henry (i) and 
Mary (Hawkes) Putnam, was born June 28, 
1778, and died in January, 1827, in Bruns- 
wick, Maine. He graduated from Harvard 
College in 1802, served in many town offices in 
Brunswick, and in 1808 was named as chair- 
man of a committee to petition the president 
to withdraw the Embargo Act. He was repre- 



sentative from Brunswick in 1813. He mar- 
ried, September 13, 1807, Catherine Hunt, 
daughter of Joseph Pease Palmer, of Ro.xbury, 
Massachusetts, who was born in 1793, and died 
December 12, 1889. She taught school in 
Brunswick from 1807 to 1825, when she re- 
moved to New York. Children : Henry, born 
1808, died 1815; Catherine, iSio, died 1827; 
George Palmer, mentioned below ; Elizabeth, 
1816, died 1875; Anne, 1819, died 1869. 

(VIII) George Palmer, son of Henry (2) 
and Catherine Hunt (Palmer) Putnam, was 
born February 7, 1814, in Brunswick, and 
died December 20, 1872, in New York. He 
received his early training, with his sisters, in 
his mother's school, a well-known and popu- 
lar institution of Brunswick. He enjoyed the 
sports of the times and region, skating on the 
Androscoggin river winter and boating up and 
down the same in summer. When he was 
eleven years of age he was offered an appren- 
ticeship in Boston to the mercantile business 
by the husband of his mother's sister, John 
Gulliver. The latter's son, John Putnam Gul- 
liver, was of the same age as young Putnam, 
and they became companions in the business 
training and work of the store. This establish- 
ment was devoted chiefly to carpets, and its 
owner was a man of strict puritanical views. 
The boys slept together in the rear of the 
store, and were chiefly occupied in keeping the 
place in order. There were few holidays, and 
the business day was a long one. The Sabbath 
was observed with full New England strict- 
ness, including morning and evening prayers 
at home, Sunday school, and two long church 
services. No reading was permitted on the 
Sabbath except in works of devotional char- 
acter, and there were very few books then 
available to the young men. Young Putnam 
had a strong taste for reading, and in later 
years he often referred to the "literary starva- 
tion" which he suffered in Boston, and also 
referred to the compunctions of conscience he 
experienced when surreptitiously reading a 
volume of Miss Edgeworth's tales. This be- 
longed to the forbidden class of fiction, and 
its reading was looked upon as a frivolity. He 
remained with his uncle in Boston about four 
years, and decided in 1829 to try his chances 
of securing a livelihood in New York City. 
From Brunswick he journeyed to Boston by 
sea, and again took ship thence to New York. 
Here he very soon became engaged in literary 
work, and during the first year after his ar- 
rival, when he was fifteen years old, he be- 
gan a historical manual which was completed 
in three years' time. In 1833 he completed

and published tlirougli West and Trow a 
weekly chronicle eniilled the Publishers' Ad- 
vertiser, lie undertook to review the current 
publications, which in that year included the 
first vokmie of J]ancroft's "L'nited States," 
Abbotts' "Voung Christian," Mrs. Sigourney's 
"Sketches," and Cooper's "Letters to My 
Countrymen." His first introduction to the 
book trade was made very shortly after his 
arrival. He speaks of his first studies as con- 
ning paragraphs in the papers beginning "Boy 
Wanted." His second apjilication was made 
at a little book and stationery store on Broad- 
way, near Maiden Lane, where he engaged 
himself to do errands, sweep, etc., for which 
he was to receive a wage of $25 per year, and 
board in the family of his employer, Mr. 
George W. Bleecker, who lived over his store. 
For a short time he was engaged as a can- 
vasser in the interest of a quarto monthly 
published by Mr. Bleecker, which took him on 
a cruise up the Hudson river. He was sub- 
sequently employed as first clerk in the Park 
Place House, an emporium of literature and 
art, and still later was general clerk and mes- 
senger for Mr. Jonathan Leavitt, in a two- 
story building at the corner of John street and 
Broadway, Mr. Leavitt being the leading pub- 
lisher of theological and religious books. 
About this time Mr. Daniel Appleton, founder 
of the great house of D. Appleton & Company, 
became connected with Mr. Leavitt. In that 
era an edition of one thousand copies of a 
new book was the average, and those of five 
hundred copies were as usual as any exceeding 
two thousand. After Mr. Appleton had es- 
tablished his own business, he and Mr. Leavitt 
published jointly an edition of one thousand 
copies, including some four hundred pages, 
prepared by young Putnam, entitled "Chronol- 
ogy, an Introduction and Index to Universal 
History." It had been prepared originally 
for his own benefit as a reference. It was 
his custom in these times to repair to the I\Ier- 
cantile Library, then recently opened, after 
the closing of the store where he was em- 
ployed, which was usually after nine o'clock. 
He read almost exclusively works of history. 
In the shop of Mr. Leavitt he was advanced 
to two dollars per week, and after a few 
months to four dollars. With this large in- 
come he felt able to buy a seat in church. In 
1833 he entered the employ of Wiley & Long, 
publishers and booksellers. In 1840 he be- 
came a partner, and the firm was styled Wiley 
& Putnam, Mr. Wiley being about one year 
the senior of Mr. Putnam. At that time the 



Api)lelons and I. & J. Harper were the lead- 
ing publishers in New York, and the princi- 
pal retail booksellers were Stanford & Swords. 
A very large jiroportion of the books then sold 
in New VOrk were imported from Lngland. 
In the firm of Wiley & Putnam the publish- 
ing division was in charge of the junior part- 
ner, while the senior gave his attention chiefly 
to the selling. Mr. Putnam held to the view 
that contemporary authors should have their 
proper share in the publication of their works, 
and he became intimately associated with Bry- 
ant, Matthews, Halleck, Cooper & Fay. In 
1840 he made his first business journey to 
England, in the effort to establish a closer re- 
lation between the book trades of the two 
countries, and in 1841 he made a second jour- 
ney to London and established a branch house 
in that city in Paternoster Row, the old-time 
center of the London book trade. The busi- 
ness of this agency was the sale of American 
books and the purchase of English publications 
for sale in the United States. Thus began 
the great publishing house, now having a 
world-wide reputation, and known as G. P. 
Putnam's Sons, and which still maintains a 
London publication office. The firm of George 
P. Putnam was established in 1848, and in 
1853 began the publication of Putitam's 
Monthly, which is now in the fifty-sixth year 
of its existence. 

In 1862 Mr. Putnam was appointed by 
President Lincoln collector of internal revenue 
of New York, and this position he acceptably 
filled for three years. His activities in con- 
nection with the spread of literature and art 
were numerous, and he was a founder, and at 
the time of his death honorary superintendent, 
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1872 
he w-as chairman of the American committee 
on art at the Vienna Exposition. His literary 
work was early recognized by Bowdoin Col- 
lege, which conferred upon him in 1853 the 
honorary degree of A. M. The career of Mr. 
Putnam furnishes an excellent example of the 
fact that a liberal education is not indispen- 
sable in the development of one's best powers 
if he be an earnest and painstaking student. 
He was accustomed to refer humorously to 
the granting of this degree as a reward for his 
services in spreading the alarm on one occa- 
sion, when a fire broke out in the college build- 
ings at Brunswick, while he was a small boy. 
He married, in May, 1841, in New York. Vic- 
torine Haven, born in 1824, daughter of Jo- 
seph Haven and of his second wife, Mary 
Parsons Tuttle. Joseph Haven was a son of

.Samuel Haven, a merchant of Boston, and 
was engaged in the china trade in that city. 
He became broken in health and died while 
Mrs. Putnam was an infant. The children of 
George Palmer Putnam and Victorine Haven 
were: Mary Corinna, born 1842, married, 
1873, Abram' Jacobi, M. D. ; George Haven, 
born 1844; Edith G., born 1846; John B.,

Several of the children were possessed of 
literary taste and have contributed more or 
less to' American literature. Among the prin- 
cipal works issued by the father were : "Amer- 
ican Facts," London and New York, 1846; 
"The World's Progress," a manual of histor- 
ical reference, New York and London, 1832- 
1871 ; "Tabular Views of Universal History." 
This constitutes the second division of "The 
World's Progress," and has been issued in suc- 
cessive editions from 1832 to 1908. The last 
edition is rewritten and brought down to date. 
The elder son is the author of: "The Ques-

Publishers," a manual of suggestions for be- 
ginners in literature (written in co-operation 
with J. B. P.), 1899, New York and Lon-

1905, had had a distinguished career as a phy- 
sician. She was the first woman to secure ad- 
mission to, and a degree from, the School of 
Medicine in Paris. She was the author of a 
number of medical treatises, and was a con- 
stant contributor to the scientific journals.

he was appointed deputy collector of internal 
revenue, and served until 1866. In 1866 he 
was admitted a partner in his father's publish- 
ing house, which is now incorporated under the 
style of G. P. Putnam's Sons, and of which 
he is the head. The establishment occupies 
spacious quarters, extending from Twenty- 
third to Twenty-fourth street, near Fifth Ave- 
nue. Mr. Putnam has taken active part in 
copyright legislation, and is himself the au- 
thor of numerous volumes bearing upon li.e 
relations of authors and pubhshers, as well

This name, 
KAWLlXSnr Rul.LJXS which is per- 
haps a modifi- 
cation of kollu. Uk' iiaiiK' of the Scandinavian 
conqueror of the north of l"'rance, about A. D. 
911, who became Duke of Normand)', has been 
borne by numerous clergymen, authors, musi- 
cians, lawyers, physicians and merchants; and 
by thousands of the sturdy middle-class people 
from whom the ranks of the rich and dis- 
tinguished are constantly replenished. As 
early as 1394 Roger Rawlin was Lord of the 
Manor of Testerton, in Norfolk, England, and 
from that date until the present time the Raw- 
lins have been found in the midst of the busy 
progressive clement of humanity. From the 
early settler in New England are sprung sev- 
eral men who have been prominent in the 
councils of the nation. 

(1) James Rawlins, some of whose descend- 
ants have since spelled their name Rollins, 
came to America in 1632, and was among the 
pioneer settlers of Ipswich. Fie remained 
there only a short time, and in 1637 was at 
Newbury, where he was probably one of an 
advance party who were looking for a suitable 
place for a settlement. In 1644 he was lo- 
cated at Dover. July 10 that year he received 
a grant of land, and November 26, 1656, he 
had another grant of one hundred acres of 
land laid out to him. At subsequent times 
he received still other grants of land. He re- 
sided at Bloody Point, in that part of ancient 
Dover which is now Newington. The public 
records gave some other facts of the life of 
James Rawlins in the New Hampshire wilder- 
ness. In the records of the court, under date 
of August 5, 1634, "It was witnessed upon 
oath that James Rawdins took 8 pence per 
day, and meat and drink for ten days' work, 
for one of his servants, for weeding corn, con- 
trary to an order of the Court" (an act regu- 
lating the price of commodities and labor) "and 
therefore he is to pay 5 shillings for every day 
he hath so transgressed." January 27, 1656, 
"James Rawlins was presented for neglect of 
coming unto the public meeting, and admon- 
ished therefor, and sentenced to pay the fees 
of the court, two shillings and six pence." Oc- 
tober 18, 1659, "The Court having considered 
the several offenses of those persons that en- 
tertained the Quakers, with the answers given 
in by them respectively, do order that James 
Rawlins, being more innocent and ingenious 
(ingenuous) than the rest, be only admonished 
by the honored Governor, which was done." 
Thus it seems that James Rawlins was three 
times before the court for acts that are no 



longer considered offences against the law. 
The arbitrary regulation of the price of labor 
was repealed the month following Mr. Raw- 
lin's appearance in ccjurt. He was compelled 
to travel to Cocheco (Dover) or Piscataqua 
(Portsmouth), a distance of several miles, by 
Indian trails and exposed to attacks by sav- 
ages, if he attended church, but this was con- 
sidered not a sufficient excuse for non-attend- 
ance in those days. As to his extending to 
• the homeless and persecuted Quakers the 
humble hospitality his home afforded, it was 
an act of charity that marks him as a man who- 
had a warmer heart and broader views than 
those who then made the laws of Massachu- 
setts. John R. Rollins, the compiler of the 
"Records of Families of the Name of Rawlins 
or Rollins, in the United States," thus char- 
acterizes James Rollins. He "was one of the 
hardy pioneers in the settlement of the West- 
ern Wilderness ; a plain, sturdy farmer, pos- 
sessed of good common sense and practical 
ideas; capable of thinking and acting for him- 
self, sometimes independently of the arbitrary 
enactments of the law of his time, and hos- 
pitable to the stranger tho' proscribed. Thus, 
probably, he spent his life, as contentedly as 
the savage foes around him would permit — 
cultivating his broad acres and rearing a fam- 
ily, who were subsequently to do their part in 
carrying out the undertaking of founding and 
establishing the new state ; and, at a good old 
age, his spirit was gathered to his fathers, 
while his ashes, the first of his tribe in the 
new world, .were mingled with the original 
soil, which he aided in clearing from the "for- 
est primeval." His will, dated December 16, 
1685, was probated July 25, 1691. His wife's 
name was Hannah. Their chiMren were: 
Ichabod, Thomas. Samuel. James, Benjamin, 
Joseph and Deborah. 

(II) Ichabod. eldest child of James and 
Hannah Rawlins, resided at Bloody Point, 
where he was taxed in 1665. It is probable 
that being the eldest son he remained on the 
homestead, which is yet in possession of a de- 
scendant. ■ He lived at Bloody Point until 
1707. May 22 that year, while driving a team 
in company with John Bunker, from Lieuten- 
ant Field's garrison to James Bunker's (be- 
tween Oyster River, now Durham, and Dover) 
for a loom, he was attacked by a party of 
twenty or thirty Indians and killed. He mar- 
ried (first) Mary, daughter of Jeremiah Tib- 
betts, of Dover Neck, who died before she at- 
tained her thirtieth year, leaving one son, 
Jeremiah. He married (second) Elizabeth, by 
whom he had one daughter, born July 16,

1706, who was less than a year old at the time 
of her father's death. 

(III) Jeremiah, only son of Ichabod and 
Mary (Tibbetts) Rawlins, lived in that part 
of Dover which is now Somersworth, and 
was one of the petitioners for the incorpora- 
tion of Somersworth into a separate parish. 
He died before 1768. His will, dated Decem- 
ber 7, 1752, was proved June 29, 1768. He 
gave to his wife Elizabeth one-half of the 
homestead while unmarried, a negro, and lands 
in Rochester; to Ichabod, "the only son," the 
homestead, land in Canterbury, and part of a 
sawmill ; to Mary, land in Rochester ; and par- 
cels of land to Sarah, Elizabeth, Deborah and 
Lydia ; Ichabod being the principal heir and 
executor of the will. Jeremiah Rawlins was 
an industrious, prudent and successful man, 
and no doubt a man of considerable influence 
among his townsmen. He married Elizabeth, 
daughter of John and Mary (Heard) Ham, 
granddaughter of William Ham, of Exeter 
and Portsmouth, who was a native of ting- 
land. She was born January 29, 1681. Their 
children were: Mary, Lydia, Deborah, Icha- 
bod, Sarah and Elizabeth. 

(IV) Hon. Ichabod (2), fourth child and 
only son of Jeremiah and Elizabeth (Ham) 
Rawlins, was born July 18, 1722, and died 
January 31, 1800. He resided in that part of 
Somersworth which was subsequently incor- 
porated and named in honor of him, Rollins- 
ford. He was a staunch patriot and a leader 
among the men of New Hampshire in the 
great struggle for independence. He was a 
member of the revolutionary conventions at 
Exeter, in April, May and December, 1775; 
one of the committee to prepare and bring into 
the convention a plan of ways and means for 
furnishing troops ; and was also one of the 
committee of supplies. June 20, 1775, he was 
sent in company with Timothy Walker, of 
Concord, a member of the committee on sup- 
plies, to ascertain the losses sustained at the 
battle of Bunker Hill, by each of the officers 
and soldiers of the New Hampshire forces, 
and in behalf of the colony to make them com- 
pensations ; also to secure to them supplies, 
and advance a month's pay to such as had en- 
listed, or might enlist, in the Continental ser- 
vice ; January 5, 1776, he was a member of 
the convention when it resolved itself into an 
independent state government; a delegate to 
the legislature, October, 1776; and the first 
judge of probate under the new government, 
which office he held from 1776 to 1784. He 
was also a member of the executive council of 
New Hampshire in 1789. He was a land 



owner and slave owner, and is said to have 
treated his slaves "in the kindest manner." 
He married (first), Abigail, daughter of Cap- 
tain Benjamin and Elizabeth Wentworth, of 
Dover. She died in her sixty-eighth year, 
October 17, 1790, and he married (second), 
in 1792, Margaret (Colton) Frost, widow of 
Joseph Frost, of Newcastle, a descendant of 
Mayor Charles Frost, of Kittery. She died at 
Rollinsford, July 5, 1813, aged eighty-nine. 
His children, all by his first wife, were: John, 
Ichabod, James, Daniel, Elizabeth, Abigail, 
Mary. 

(V) John, eldest child of Judge Ichabod 
(2) and Abigail (Wentworth) Rollins, was 
born March 22, 1745, and resided in Somers- 
worth, where he died January 23, 1820, aged 
seventy-five. He was a cultivator of the soil, 
had qualities of leadership, and represented 
his town in the legislature in 1789. He mar- 
ried JMary, daughter of Dr. ]\Ioses Carr, of 
Newbury, Massachusetts. She died April 16, 
1823, aged seventy-eight. Their children 
were: Hiram, Mary, John, Elizabeth (died 
young), George, James, EHzabeth, Abigail, 
Sarah, Paul (died young), and Paul. 

(VI) John (2), third child and second son 
of John (i) and Mary (Carr) Rollins, was 
born in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Jan- 
uary 26, 1771, and lived in that town until 
1792, when he removed to Lebanon, Maine. 
He married, in August, 1791, Elizabeth, 
daughter of Elisha and Elizabeth (Waldron) 
Shapleigh, by wdiom he had eleven children : 
Moses, Elisha, Daniel G., John, Richard, 
Paul, David Legro, Caroline, Elizabeth Wal- 
dron, Samuel Shapleigh and Andrew Went- 
worth. 

(VII) Hon. Daniel Gustavus, third son and 
child of John (2) and Elizabeth (Shapleigh) 
Rollins, was born in Lebanon, October -3, 
1796, and died in Somersworth, February, 
1873. From 1823 to May 31, 1826, he resided 
at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he was 
agent of the Portsmouth Sugar Refining Com- 
pany. From the latter date until 1835 he was 
engaged in trade in Wakefield. His fine busi- 
ness ability and experience made him a favor- 
ite town official, and he filled various town 
offices. He was chairman of the board of se- 
lectmen of Wakefield from 1829 to 1834, with 
the exception of the year 1832. He was also 
town treasurer. In 1838-39 and 1840-41-44- 
45, he was chairman of the board of selectmen 
of Somersworth. The same years, and also 
1843 and 1858, he was town treasurer, and in 
other town offices; in 1843, 1853 and 1854 he 
was a member of the New Hampshire legis-

he was constitutionally disqualified, and the 
office became vacant. Judge Rollins was a 
man of the strictest integrity, great activity, 
and exceptional business qualifications. He 
endeavored to be on the right side of all pub- 
lic questions, and gave his support to those 
movements that are inaugurated to promote the 
public welfare. He was always a warm friend 
of the temperance cause, and was for three 
years president of the Great Falls Temper- 
ance Society. He married, February 3, 1825, 
Susan Binney Jackson, who was born in New- 
ton, September 13, 1805, and died in the sum- 
mer of 1888, aged eighty-three years. She 
was the daughter of Captain Simon and Sally

and entered the internal revenue office, when 
it had been inaugurated but three weeks. In 
1869 he was appointed collector of internal

I'ortland, where his early life was passed. He 
attended the public schools of his native city 
and graduated from the high school in 1888. 
Entering Dartmouth College at once, he was 
graduated from that institution in 1892, fol- 
lowing which he spent a year at Harvard Law 
School in Cambridge. In November, 1893, he 
went to New York Cfty and entered the law- 
office of his uncle, Daniel G. Rollins, for fur- 
ther study. Having made the most of his 
opportunities, he was admitted to the bar in 
November, 1894, and immediately engaged in 
practice in association with his uncle. This 
arrangement continued until the death of the 
latter, August 30, 1897. The law firm of Rol- 
lins & Rollins was then formed by Jordan J. 
Rollins and his cousin, Philip A. Rollins, and 
this has been one of the most successful in the 
city. It now occupies a large suite of offices 
in the Mutual Life Building, where many as- 
sistants are employed and a large amount of 
business transacted. Mr. Rollins takes part in 
many of the social activities of New York, for 
which he is amply fitted by a genial nature. 
He is a member of the New York State Bar 
Association, the Association of the Bar of the 
City of New York and of the New York Law 
Institute, of which he has been many vears 
secretary. In religious faith he is a Congre-

STATE OF MAINE. 



(For first generation see preceding sketch.) 

(II) Thomas, second son and 
ROLLINS child of James and Hannah 
Rawlins (Rollins), was born 
perhaps in 1643, ^"<^1 resided at Bloody Point 
until after 1668, when he removed to Exeter, 
New Hampshire, and there passed the remain- 
der of his life. His farm was located on the 
old road leading fi'om Exeter to Hampton. 
He was one of the company of Edward Gove 
who were found in arms and endeavoring to 
overthrow the government of Governor Ed- 
ward Cranfield, known as Gove's Rebellion. 
It is a matter of history that all except the 
leader in this rebellion were pardoned. On 
one of these petitions for the removal of 
Cranfield appears the name of Thomas Rol- 
lins, and his rebellious blood seems to have 
been bequeathed to his descendants, for in the 
revolution twenty or more of them formed 
against the arbitrary government of George 
III. Rollins was a justice of the peace in 
1682. He was married, about 1670, to Rachel, 
daughter of J\Ioses and Alice Cox, of Hamp- 
ton. It is probable that his death occurred 
about 1706, as the inventory of his property 
was returned to the probate office November 
3 of that year. His children were : Thomas, 
Moses, Joseph, ]\Iary, Benjamin, Aaron, Sam- 
uel, John, Alice and Rachel. 

(III) John, seventh son of Thomas and 
Rachel (Cox) Rollins, was born in Dover, 
New Hampshire, and removed to East Brad- 
ford, now Groveland, Massachusetts. He 
lived on the river road near the old chain 
ferry, and the house in which he resided is still 
in a good state of preservation. He removed 
with his family to Damariscotta, Maine, where 
he died in 1776, the year of our independence. 
He married (first) Mary, daughter of Thomas 
Sevary, July 31, 1732; (second) Mary Glid-

From the Herald's College, 
KIMBALL London, comes the statement 

that the family of Kimball is 
from the county of Cumberland, England, and 
takes its origin from a parish of that name 
upon the Scottish border. The ancestor from 
whom the principal American branch of the 
family sprang, came from Rattlesden, in the 
county of Suttolk (not far from London) in 
which county the Kemballs have lived at least 
four hundred years. The name has been vari- 
ously spelled, "according to the taste and fancy 
of the speller." The original name is claimed 
to have been "Kymbolde;" the American an- 
cestor wrote it Kemball, and his descendants 
changed it to Kimball. The Kimballs, as a 
stock, have been noted for .their retentive 
memories ; and in business circles they have 
been exceptionally strong; and have taken 
leading places in local affairs. 

(I) Richard Kimball, the ancestor in Amer- 
ica, resided in the parish of Rattlesden, in the 
county of Suffolk, England, as is shown by 
the parish register of the date of the baptism 
of his son Henry, August 12, 161 5. He em- 
barked with his family at Ipswich, county of 
Suft'olk, England, April 10, 1634, in the ship 
"Elizabeth," William Andrews, master, and 
sailed for Boston in New England, where he 
arrived in due course of time. From Boston 
it seems that he soon went to Watertown. 
He is said to have been thirty-nine years old 



at this time. His home lot in the first division 
was a parcel of si.xty acres, bounded on the 
north by Cambridge, and now forms a part 
of that town which afterward annexed the 
eastern part of Watertown. He was made 
freeman May 6, 1635, and became a projjrietor 
in 1637. Soon afterward he accei)tcd an invi- 
tation to move to Ijiswich, where he followed 
the calling of wheelwright the remainder of 
his days. February 23, 1637, the town granted 
him a house lot at the west end of town and 
"40 acres beyond North river." In 1639 he 
had liberty to pa.sturc "two cows free." On 
"the last day of the last month 1641" he is 
mentioned as "Among the Commoners of Ips- 
wich." He was appointed one of the seven 
men March i, 1645. On the 22d day of the 
loth month, 1647, he was allowed two pounds 
for killing two foxes. In January, 1649, ''"•" 
was given permission "to sell such white oaks 
as he hath occasion to use about his trade for 
the town use." December 19. 1648, he con- 
tributed with others three shillings as his an- 
nual proportion toward the sum of £27 7s. as 
a rate for the services of their military leader, 
Major David Dennison, then commander of 
the military forces of Essex and Norfolk coun- 
ties. In September, 1652, he was one of the 
appraisers of the estate of John Cross. Jan- 
uary 25, 1652, Richard and his son Richard 
Kimball, wheelwrights, "for £14 sell 30 acres 
of upland bounding on land of Mr. John Win- 
throp;" also another lot of land of ten acres 
of meadow. In 1653 he was one of a com- 
mittee of three to survey fences in the com- 
mon fields north of the river. In 1664 he 
owned forty-three shares in Plumb Island. He 
made his will March 5, 1675, and died June 
22, 1675, aged more than eighty years. This 
will was probated September 28, 1675. The 
inventory of the estate, although he had given 
property to his children on their marriages, 
amounted to £y7,y 3s. 6d., a good estate for 
that time and place. Richard" Kimball mar- 
ried (first) Ursula, daughter of Henry Scott, 
of Rattlesden, and (second), October 23, 1661, 
Margaret, widow of Henry Dow, of Hampton, 
New Hampshire. She died March i, 1676. 
The children of Richard Kimball, all by the 
first wife, were : Abigail. Henrv, Elizabeth, 
Richard. Mary, Martha'^ John, Thomas, Sarah, 
Benjamin, and Caleb. 

(II) Henry, eldest son and second child of 
Richard Kimball, was born in Rattlesden, Suf- 
folk county, England, baptized August 12. 
161 5, and came to America in the ship "Eliza- 
beth" with his father in 1634. He first settled 
in Watertown, Massachusetts, but some time

after 1646 followed his father to Ipswich, and 
about 1655 removed to Wenham, and spent the 
remainder of his life in that town. November 
8, 1657, he subscribed three pounds as minis- 
ter's rate, one-half in wheat, the other half in 
Indian corn, "at merchant's price." In 1659 
he subscribed three pounds fifty shillings, one- 
half in com, and in 1660-61 he contributed ten 
shillings toward the new meeting house. He 
was chosen constable October 2.2, 1669. He 
died in Wenham, in 1676, leaving an estate in- 
ventoried at one hundred seventy-seven pounds 
twelve shillings. He married (first) about

(H) Richard (2), son of 
KIMBALL Richard (i) and Ursula 

(Scott) Kimball, was born in 
Rattlesden, England, in 1623, and died in 
Wenham, Massachusetts, May 26, 1676. He 
came to America with his father. He was 
called a wheelwright and yeoman. In a deposi- 



tion dated September, 1658, he mentions hav- 
ing "lived on Goodman Shatswell's farm for 
seven years." ] le removed to Wenham be- 
tween 1652 and 1656, settled in the westerly 
part of the town, and was the first settler 
named Kimball in that town. It seems that 
he was the largest taxpayer among the early 
settlers. That he owned large amounts of 
lands at different times is shown by the rec- 
ords of numerous conveyances in the records 
at Salem, November 8, 1657, he subscribed 
£3 to the minister's rate, to be paid one-half 
in wheat and one-half in Indian corn. The 
next year he was chosen selectman, and was 
continued in that office with the exception of 
three years, till 1674. December 4, 1660, he 
was one of a committee to see about building 
a new meeting house. February 28, 1663, the 
town leased two hundred acres of the best of 
its common land for one thousand years to 
Abner Ordway, Thomas Searles, John Ed- 
wards and Richard Kimball Jr. Richard Kim- 
ball was one of a committee to perfect the line 
between Bass River and Wenham, and July 18, 
1673, was one of a committee to establish 
rates for the cost of building a meeting house. 
The amount of the inventory of his estate 
taken after his death was £986 i6s. 6d. His 
dwelling house and one hundred and thirty- 
two acres of land and one hundred and sev- 
enty acres of meadow belonging to it were 
appraised at £370. He also had two hundred 
acres at Rowley Village. The genealogist de- 
duces from the fact that Thomas Kimball had 
wages due him from the county at the time 
of his death, as stated in his inventory, that 
it is possible that he had been engaged' in the 
war with the Indians, and was probably with 
his nephew, Caleb Kimball, at the time the lat- 
ter was killed at Bloody Brook. Richard Kim- ■ 
ball married (first) Mary, whose surname 
does not transpire. She died September 2, 
1672. His second wife was also named Mary,

the last two probably by his first wife, were: 
John, Samuel, Thomas, Ephraim, Caleb, Chris- 
topher, Richard, a child, and Nathaniel. 

(Ill) Caleb Kimball, fifth son of Richard 
(2) and Mary Kimball, was born in Wenham, 
April 9, 1665, and died there Januarv 25, 1726! 
He was a yeoman and mason. He bought land 
as early as 1720, in Exeter, New Hampshire, 
and after residing there a while returned to 
Wenham. He conveyed this farm to his son 
Abraham on condition that he should pay the 
other children their shares in their father's 
estate. His wife Sarah died February 20, 
1732. Their children were: Caleb, Sarah!

The name Hale under the different 
HALE forms of de la Hale, at-IIalc, 
Hales and Hale, has been abun- 
dant in Hertfordshire, England, since the early 
part of the thirteenth century. No evidence 
appears that any of the name were above the 
rank of yeoman before 1560. The name also 
early prevailed and is probably still found in 
a dozen other counties in England. Of the 
Hales of Gloucestershire, to which family be- 
longed the illustrious Sir Matthew Hale, Lord 
Chief Justice, Atkyns, in his history of that 
county, says : "The family of Hale has been 
of ancient standing in this county, and always 
csteemcil for their probity and charity." 
Within the first fifty years after the settle- 
ment of Massachusetts Bay, at least eight emi- 
grants of the name of Hale, and perhaps two 
or three more, settled in that colony and in 
Connecticut, descendants of five of whom are 
traced to the present time. There is no evi- 
dence that any of these were of kin to Thomas 
of Newbury, the immigrant ancestor of the 
line of which this article treats. The name 
was also found among the early settlers of 
\'irginia and Maryland, and their descendants 
bearing the cognomen are still found in the 
southern states. In New England the name 
has been brought into prominence by Nathan 
Hale, the patriot; by John P. Hale, the dis- 
tinguished statesman of New Hampshire ; 
Senator Eugene Hale, of Maine, and others. 

(•I) Thomas Hale, the earliest known 
progenitor of the family herein considered, 
was of the parish of Walton-at-Stone, in Hert- 
fordshire, England. No record of his birth is 
found, but the parish register, which styles 
him "Thomas Hale, Senior," shows that he 
was buried October 19, 1630. He left a will 
bearing date October 11, 1630, proved De- 
cember 9, 1630, in the court of the Archdea- 
conry of Hitchin, in the county of Herts, the 
original of which is still on file among the rec- 
ords of the court. After the usual pious pro- 
fession of faith, thanks to God, committal of 
his soul to its creator and his body to burial, 
he disposes of his personal property and his 



real estate consisting of eleven, and perhaps 
twelve, distinct parcels. Among those desig- 
nated are the house close, the backside close, 
the hill close, and the meadow and rye close. 
From the brief record it is apparent that he 
was of the rank of yeoman of the smaller 
class as to property but marked by thrift, re- 
spectability, honesty, piety, and prudent fore- 
sight. It is impossible to determine tlie value 
of the estate which he left, but it was evidently 
not large, perhaps worth an annual rental of 
$400 or $500. He married Joan Kirby, who 
was of the parish of Little Munden, Herts, 
which was probably the place of her birth and 
their marriage. They were the parents of five 
children: Dionis, Thomas,^ Mary, Dorothy 
and Elizabeth. At some time between her 
husband's death and June, 1637, Joan, widow 
of Thomas Hale, married a L^ydes, or Bides, 
probably John, and was still living in October, 
1640, the date of her mother's will, but was 
probably dead before 1660. 

(II) Thomas (2), second child and only 
son of Thomas (i) and Joan (Kirby) Hale, 
was probably born in the parish of Walton-at- 
Stone, in Alay or June, 1606, and was bap- 
tized in the parish, June 15, 1606. He was 
heir to the larger part of his father's estate, 
receiving all his goods and chattels with a few 
exceptions. The rents he paid to his mother 
and sisters was nine pounds a year in all, 
which in that day were equivalent in value to 
£27 or perhaps £36, that is $135 or $180 at 
the present day. Probably through the influ- 
ence of his mother's brother, Francis Kirby, 
Thomas Hale became interested in New Eng- 
land, whither he removed and settled in New- 
bury, Massachusetts, in 1635. He took from 
his uncle, Francis Kirby, to Governor John 
Winthrop, a letter from wdiich the following 
extract with some changes as to orthography 
is taken : "These are now to entreat you that 
you would be assistant to the bearer hereof 
(Thomas Hale, my near kinsman) in your 
counsel and advise to put him in the way how 
and where to settle himself in a hopeful way 
of subsisting with his family. He has brought 
with him all his estate, wdiich he hath here 
or can have during the life of his mother, my 
sister. He had almost tw-o hundred pounds 
when he began to make his provision for this 
voyage. I suppose the greatest half is ex- 
pended in his transportation, and in such nec- 
essaries as will be spent by him and his fam- 
ily in the first use; the lesser half, I suppose 
he has in money, and vendable goods to pro- 
vide with a cottage to dwell in, and a milch 
cow for his children's sustenance. I suppose

his way will be to hire a house or part of a 
house for the first year, until he can look out 
and buy or build him a dwelling wherein, as 
in other things, I shall entreat you to direct 
him." 

Thomas Hale and his wife Thomasine (or 
Tamosin) and son Thomas, were probably of 
the party who first settled in Newbury in 1635, 
on the banks of the "'Quascacunquen," or Par- 
ker river, though his name is not included 
among those mentioned by Coffin as forming 
the first colony, "with a few others whose 
names are not known with certainty." Under 
date of August 10, 1638, appears the eniry in 
the Newbury records: "Thomas Hale and 
John Baker are appointed haywards till the 
town shall appoint anew." February 23, 1642, 
Thomas Hale was appointed one of the five 
men to whom the stinting of the commons 
was referred. He moved to Haverhill, prob- 
ably in 1645. ■'■" that year he is named as a 
landholder in Haverhill, and from Newbury. 
His name heads the list of the first board of 
selectmen chosen in Haverhill in 1646. In 
that same year his name first appears on the 
record of assessments in that town. In 1647 
he was chosen by the town and approved by 
the general court, with Henry Palmer and 
Thomas Davis, "to try small cases." The 
same year he was appointed by the general 
court a commissioner to lay out a road from 
Andover to Haverhill. In 1648 he was ap- 
pointed by the town "to keep a ferry." In 
1649 he was elected constable, the first chosen 
in Haverhill. In 1650 he was appointed by 
the town "to meet men from Salisbury to lav 
out lands between that town and Haverhill." 
In 1651 "Little River," in Haverhill, was 
named as "Thomas Hale's River." In or 
about the year 1652 he returned to Newbury, 
and contiiuied to reside there till 1657, when 
he removed to Salem. There he remained till 
about the year 1661, when he again returned 
to Newbury, where he continued to reside till 
his death. His name appears in the list of 
proprietors of Newbury, declared by the ordi- 
nance of December 7, 1642, as the only per- 
sons "acknowledged to be freeholders by the 
town and to have proportionable right in 
all waste lands, commons and rivers undis- 
posed," etc. His name appears in the town 
records of Salem in 1657 as "Sarjent Thomas 
Hale," and he is several times referred to in 
those records as "clerk of the market." .A.fter 
his final return to Newbury he is found among 
the active supporters of the Rev. Mr. Parker 
in his controversies with a portion of his 
church, while the name of his son Thomas 



appears uniformly among the antagonists of 
Mr. Parker, known as "]Mr. Woodman's 
party." Conveyances of real estate from him 
appear in the Essex records in 1640-52-55-56- 
66-69, '" which he is described as "of New- 
bury." In conveyances appearing in 1647 and 
1648, he is described as "of Haverhill," and in 
sundry of 1658, 1659, 1660 and 1661, as "of 
Salem." In these conveyances he is usually 
described a "glover," sometimes as "yeoman," 
and once as "leather-dresser." He seems to 
have been an active and public spirited man, 
held in respect by his fellow citizens in the 
several towns in which he lived, and his long 
life was evidently one of active usefulness. 
By trade a glover, he united with that employ- 
ment some practice as a surveyor, and his 
various public employments show him to have 
been a man of fair education and business 
qualifications. He died in Newbury, Decem- 
ber 21, 1682. His widow Thomasine survived 
him just forty days ("a widow's quaran- 
tine"), and died in Newbury, January 30, 
1683. No will appears of record, nor any ad- 
ministration of his estate. Their children, the 
eldest said to have been born in England, the 
others all in Newbury, were : Thomas, John, 
Samuel and Apphia. 

(Ill) Thomas (3), eldest child of Thomas 
(2) and Thomasine Hale, was born in Eng- 
land, November 18, 1633. and came to .\mer- 
ica with his parents probably in 1637. He 
seems to have resided in Newbury, anrl died 
there October 22, 1688. One of the church 
dissensions, by no means uncommon in New 
England in those days, arose about 1670, and 
Thomas Hale took sides against the preacher, 
Parker, and was fined one noble by the court 
at Ipswich, May 29, 1671. .'Ml but two of the 
entire Woodman party were fined. Thomas 
Hale's will was e.xecuted March 20, 1687, and 
probated December 12, 1688. His wife Mary 
was executrix of the will, and swore to the 
inventory, the total of which, real and per- 
sonal, was i505 1 6s. 8d., the homestead having 
been deeded to .son Thomas before his death. 
The amount of property left constituted what 
at that time and in that part of the world was 
considered a handsome estate. Mr. Hale was 
a man of local prominence, and filled numer- 
ous places in the public service. He was 
fence-viewer in Newbury in 1661-66-75-77- 
78-80 ; was chosen to carry votes to Salem, 
1665, 1674; was selectman. 1665-75-78; trial 
juror 1675-77-78-79; tythingman 1679-80-81; 
highway surveyor 1676-77; way-warden 
1674-79; and on town committees 1673-74- 
76-77-78-79-80. He married, at Salem, Alay

uel. 

(l\'j CaiHain Joseph, eiLjhlli child and 
third son of Thoma.s (3) and Mary (Hutchin- 
son) Hale, was born in Newbury, I'^ebruary 
20, 1671, and died in Boxford, February 13, 
1761, aged ninety. He was settled in Boxford 
with his mother as early as 1692. June 28, 
1692, Joseph, with his mother Mary, both 
described as of Newbury, received from Dan- 
iel Northend a deed of two hundred acres in 
Boxford, "in or near a place formerly called 
the Village Plains," and on "Pie Brook." 
November 13. 1693. he received from his 
mother iMary a deed of two hundred and 
eighty acres with buildings in Boxford, and 
six acres of marsh in Newbury, wdiich she 
had lately purchased of Joseph Poor, of New- 
bury, he to come into immediate possession of 
one-half, and of the other one-half at her 
decease, provided he should marry Mary, 
daughter of William Watson, etc. February 
17, 1703, he received of William Watson a 
deed of sixty acres of land in Boxford, re- 
citing that he received one-half of the same 
when he married said Watson's daughter 
Mary, and he now bought the other one-half, 
together with other land. In the following 
forty-five or more years he was grantor or 
grantee in many deeds, and is variously de- 
scribed as "yeoman," "house carpenter," "hus- 
bandman," and "gentleman," at different 
times. He was undoubtedly a man of means, 
active, ambitious, and well thought of, as is 
shown by the public positions he held. He 
was selectman of Boxford in 1702. Under 
the title of "Ensign Joseph Hale" he repre- 
sented Boxford in the general court in 1714- 
15-16-17; under that of "Lieutenant Joseph 
Hale," also in 1720-21-22-23-24-25; nnder 
that of "Captain Joseph Hale," in 1728-29- 
,^0-31-32: and as "Joseph Hale" simply, in 
1735. Upon the record of town meetings in 
Boxford appears the following entry: "May 
9, 1722. Voted that upon consideration of 
Lieutenant Hale's meeting with so much loss 
and damage the last year by reason of his 
having the small-pox, to give him ten pounds. 



and let him have it as soon as may be." He 
may have received this allowance on account 
of having contracted the disease while serving 
as rejiresentative of the town in the legis- 
lature. He married, November 15, 1693, 
Mary, daughter of William and Sarah (Per- 
ley) W'atson, of Boxford. She died February 
I, 1708; and he was published to Joanna 
Dodge, widow, at Ipswich, September 19, 
1708. His children by the first wife were: 
Joseph, Jacob, Mary, Ambrose, Abner, Moses, 
and Sarah; and by the second wife: Hepzi- 
bah, Lydia, Margaret, Thomas, John, Han- 
nah and Benjamin. 

(V) .'Vmbrose, fourth child and third son of 
Captain Joseph and Mary (^Watson) Hale, 
was born in Boxford, July 16, 1699, and died 
in Harvard, April 13, 1767. He seems to 
have been a farmer, and is named as a party 
to various conveyances. May 23, 1722, he re- 
ceived from his father Joseph and wife Jo- 
anna, a deed of settlement of eighty-two acres 
of land in Boxford by the gate on the village 
road which leads from Piebrook to Andover 
Road. February, 1742, he deeded to Joseph 
Simmons, of Ipswich, his homestead in Box- 
ford, eighty-five acres ; and after the making 
of this deed he disappears from the records of 
Essex county. Neither does he appear on 
the probate records. An Ambrose Hale, of 
Harvard, was a soldier in Captain John 
Church's company in 1759. Ambrose was 
then about sixty years old. He had sons Am- 
brose and Benjamin, and removed with them 
from Boxford to Harvard about 1742. A will 
of Ambrose Hale, of Harvard, signed Febru- 
ary 5, 1761, and again February 7, 1761, 
proved in V\'orcester probate office May 12, 
1767, names children: Martha, Benjamin, 
Abigail, Adna, Moses, Hannah, Sarah and 
Ambrose. The inventory of his realty was 
£200, and of his personalty, £82 17s. 6d. Am- 
brose Hale married in Boxford, December 11, 
1722, Joanna Dodge. She died February 10, 
1732. He then married (published December 
10, 1732) Hannah, daughter of John and Han- 
nah (Hazen) Symonds, of Boxford. She was 
born in Boxford, April 13, 1709. His chil- 
dren by first wife Joanna were: Martha, 
David, Benjamin, Abigail and Ambrose; and 
by wife Hannah: Jacob, .'\dna, Moses, Han- 
nah, Sarah. Ambrose, and one or two who 
died young. 

(VI) Benjamin, eldest son of Ambrose and 
Joanna Hale, was born in Boxford, March 14, 
1728, and died September 20, 1771, in Har- 
vard, to which town he had removed with his 
father. He served in the French war in

1757-58, and was a corporal in Captain 
Haskell's company which marched from Har- 
vard for Fort Wilham Henry in 1757. A 
Benjamin Hale was also in the expedition to 
Crown Point, enlisted September 7, 1755, in 
Captain Daniel Fletcher's company. Colonel 
Josiah Brown's regiment. This was probably 
the Benjamin of this sketch. He died intestate, 
and Israel Taylor was administrator of his 
estate. His inventory dated October 5, 1771, 
enumerated realty of the value of £300; per- 
sonalty £105 4S. lod. He married, in Harvard, 
October 6, 1757, Mary Taylor, of Harvard. 
She survived him, and March 3, 1784, was 
adininistratrix dc bonis non of her late hus- 
band's estate. They had children: Israel, 
Ohver, Mary, Benjamin, Rachael, Joanna, 
Sarah and David. 

(VII) David, eighth and youngest child of 
Benjamin and Mary (Taylor) Hale, was born 
in Harvard, I\Iarch 22, 1772. He settled in 
Rutland, Massachusetts, and after living there 
some years removed to Turner, Maine, where 
he spent the remainder of his life, dying Feb- 
ruary 6, 1846. The homestead farm is still in 
possession of the family. He married Sarah 
Kingsbury, of Ellington, Connecticut, who 
was born in 1766, a daughter of Simon Kings- 
bury. Their children were: David, James 
Sullivan, Sophia, Marinda and Sarah Kings- 
bury. 

(\TII) James Sullivan, second son and child 
of David and Sarah (Kingsbury) Hale, was 
born in Turner, December 13, 1806, and died 
December 17, 1880, aged seventy-four. He 
was a farmer by occupation, well to do in life, 
a man of marked individuality of character, 
possessing a keen wit and a lively sense of 
humor, but was not ambitious and spent his 
life in his native town. He married, Febru- 
ary II, 1835, Betsey Staples, who was bom 
October 16, 1808, and died December 5, 1881. 
She was the eldest child of John Staples and 
Betsey Young Staples, of Turner. Their chil- 
dren were: i. Eugene, see forward. 2. Hor- 
tense, November 27, 1837, married, October 
21, 1858, Dr. John T. Gushing, of Turner. 3. 
Frederick, October 21, 1839, graduated from 
Waterville College in 1862, studied and prac- 
ticed law in Ellsworth, and died May 6, 1868. 

4. Augusta, February ig, 1842, married Au- 
gust 8, 1869, Hon. George Gifford, of Port- 
land, afterward consul at Basle, Switzerland. 

5. Clarence, see forward. 

(IX) Hon. Eugene Hale, son of James Sul- 
livan and Betsy (Staples) Hale was born 
June 9, 1836. "Representative Men of 



Maine," published in 1893, gives the following 
account of Senator Hale : 

He was born in Turner, June 9, 1836; at- 
tended the village district school and the gram- 
mar school endowed by the town, and went 
from Hebron Academy to the office of How- 
ard & Strout, in Portland, where he studied 
law. and was admitted to the bar in January, 
1857. At the age of twenty he commenced 
the practice of law in Orland, but soon re- 
moved to Ellsworth and became a member of 
the firm of Robinson & Hale. Mr. Robinson 
soon died and Mr. Hale for ten years devoted 
himself closely to his profession and built up 
a large practice. He was a sound counselor 
and one of the most successful lawyers with 
both court and jury. He was for nine suc- 
cessive years county attorney for Hancock 
county. For many years he was senior mem- 
ber of the firm of Hale & Emery, and since 
the latter's elevation to the bench of the su- 
preme court, the firm has consisted of Mr. 
Hale and Hannibal E. Hamlin, a son of the 
late and venerated Hannibal Hamlin. In De- 
cember, 1871, Mr. Hale was married in Wash- 
ington to Mary Douglas Chandler, only 
daughter of Hon. Zachariah Chandler, long 
time a senator from Michigan, and afterwards 
Secretary of the Interior. Their children are : 
Chandler, Frederick and Eugene. 

Mr. Hale was a member of the state legis- 
lature in 1867, 1868 and 1880. In that body 
he soon proved a ready debater, and remark- 
ably well versed in the political questions of the 
time. In 1880 he was appointed chairman of 
the committee of the legislature to investigate 
what has since become familiarly known as 
the "State Steal," and it is recognized as 
largely through his efforts that this scheme 
was thwarted and exposed. He was elected 
to the forty-first congress in 1868, and after- 
wards to the forty-second and forty-third con- 
gresses ; was appointed postmaster-general by 
President Grant in 1874, but declined; was 
re-elected to the forty-fourth and forty-fifth 
congresses ; was tendered a cabinet position as 
Secretary of the Navy by President Hayes, 
and declined ; was chairman of the Republican 
congressional committee for the forty-fifth 
congress ; was a delegate to the national con- 
vention in 1868 and the Cincinnati and Chi- 
cago conventions in 1876 and 1880, leading the 
Blaine forces in both conventions ; was elected 
to the United States senate to succeed Hanni- 
bal Hamlin, and took his seat March 4, 1881, 
and was re-elected in 1887, 1893, 1899 and 
1905, and at the end of this term will have 



STATE OF MAINE.

rounded out thirty years in the senate. For 
tlie five elections he received the unanimous 
vote of his party in the lei^islature. Me was 
a member of im])i)rtant committees in the 
House of Representatives, and upon his com- 
ing to the Senate, in 1881, he was given place 
on the committees of appropriation and naval 
affairs. He was also made chairman of the 
committee on the census, which position he 
continued to occupy till the Democrats gained 
control of that body in 1893. He is at present 
acting chairman of the committee on appro- 
priations, chairman of committee on naval 
afifairs, and member of the finance, Philip- 
pines census, Canadian relations, and private 
land claims committees, and is now chairman 
of the Republican conference of the senate, 
and of the Republican steering committee. 
Senator Hale has always taken a prominent 
part in the legislation of the senate. Many of 
the most important appropriation bills have 
been passed under his management. Repre- 
senting both the appropriation and naval com- 
mittees, he has reported and managed every 
bill which has passed the senate for the build- 
ing of the new navy. He introduced the first 
amendment favoring reciprocity with the coun- 
tries of Central and South .America, which he 
supported with speeches that received wide 
circulation. His speeches in the senate are 
sharp, but never ill-natured. His speech upon 
the free trade attitude of the Democratic con- 
vention in 1882. was as widely circulated as 
any speech during the campaign. He has 
taken a prominent part in the debates relating 
to the affairs of the District of Columbia, and 
has favored suitable appropriations for the 
necessary buildings for the public business 
there. Senator Hale is always recognized as 
a wise counselor in party politics. He is an 
easy and forcible speaker; his words are care- 
fully selected, and his extemporaneous 
speeches require no revision. He is a popular 
after-dinner speaker ; and on these occasions, 
both where great subjects are presented and 
where wit and merriment abound, he is in his 
element. He is a wide reader, keeping alive 
his love of books, and delights especially in 
poetry. His style has been formed on the best 
models in English literature. He has re- 
ceived the degree of LL.D. from Bowdoin and 
Bates Colleges and from Colby University. 
Senator Hale is a believer in Elaine and her 
future. His investments testify to this, com- 
mencing with his beautiful home on the 
heights at Ellsworth, surrounded by several 
hundred acres of field and woodland, and con- 
tinuing in extensive purchases of timber lands 



and sea-shore property, interests in cotton, 
woolen and pulj) mills, and other manufactor- 
ies. He is known throughout the state an<l 
nation as a man of broad and genial social na- 
ture; and this, i)erhaps accounts for the close 
and cordial personal feeling which binds him 
to his friends. He is a liberal entertainer both 
in Washington and Ellsworth. At his house, 
"The Pines," during the summer vacation, 
many friends, both from within and without 
the state, gladly accept his hospitalities. Mrs. 
Hale is an accomplished hostess, and delights 
in nothing more than looking after a house full 
of friends. 

(IX) Clarence, fifth and youngest child of 
James S. and Betsey (Staples) Hale, was born 
in Turner, April 15, 1848. He attended the 
public schools of Turner, finished his prepara- 
tion for college at Norway Academy, and in 
1865 entered Bowdoin College, from which he 
graduated with honors in i86g. He was a 
member of Phi Beta Kappa, and one of the 
first four of his class. After reading law at 
Ellsworth with his brother, Hon. Eugene 
Hale, and with Lucilius A. Emery, now chief 
justice of Maine, he was admitted to the bar 
and began practice at Portland in 1871. For 
thirty years he devoted his energies to the 
practice of his profession, and while yet a 
young man took rank as one of the leading 
lawyers of the state. His practice w"as exten- 
sive and profitable, and in the years of his pro- 
fessional career he was connected with many 
of the leading cases in the state. In 1879 he 
was elected city solicitor of Portland, and 
filled that office three years with credit to him- 
self and satisfaction to the citizens of the mu- 
nicipality. In the preparation of his papers 
Mr. Hale displayed a ckar understanuhig of 
his cases and a terse and precise style of ex- 
pression in keeping with the busy age in which 
he lives ; in his argument of matters of law to 
the court he made himself persona grata by a 
logically arranged and closely connected argu- 
ment tliat put the facts in the most telling 
form in the shortest time; before a jury he 
was a strong man, using good English clearly 
expressed, taking care to make all details in- 
telligible, yet speaking forcefully and often elo- 
quently. In igo2 his ability as a jurist was 
recognized in such a way as to make him con- 
spicuous in New England, where he was ap- 
pointed judge of the United States district 
court, a position in which he has since found 
ample opportunity to display the qualifications 
which have made him prominent. In the cam- 
paign w'hen General Grant became a candidate 
for re-election to the presidency, Mr. Hale

made his debut in politics, and from that time 
until he came to the bench he was an able 
advocate of the Republican party, speaking in 
every election year. From 1883 to 1885 he rep- 
resented the Portland district in the state 
legislature, where he displayed ability and 
knowledge w'hich placed him among the lead- 
ers of the house. He is prominent in local 
financial circles, and is a director and trustee 
in various monetary institutions. He has an 
innate love for literature, which has grown 
and strengthened as it has been indulged. He 
is a member of the Maine Historical Society, 
and takes a lively interest in that institution, 
to the success of which he has been a willing 
contributor. In religious faith he and his wife 
are Congregationalists and members of State 
Street Church. 

Judge Clarence Hale married, March 11, 
1880, Margaret Rollins, who was born in Port- 
land, June 12, 1856, daughter of Franklin J. 
and Arabella C. Rollins, of Portland. (See 
Rollins.) They have two children: Kath- 
arine, born in Portland, March 30, 1884; mar- 
ried Philip G. Clifford, and has one daughter, 
Margaret Ellen Clliiford, born March 16, 1908 
(see Clifford): and Robert, born November 
29, 1889, who is a student at Bowdoin Col- 
lege. 



The name of Paine, in an early 
PAINE form, came to England with the 

Normans and William the Con- 
queror. In Normandy, a millenium ago, the 
Latin word "Paganus" had the meaning of 
"villager." and since the villagers resisted con- 
version to Christianity longer than the deni- 
zens of the cities, it acquired the added sig- 
nificance of "unbeliever." Plaving become a 
surname, it passed through the changes from 
Paganus to Pagan, Pagen, Payen, Payne, 
Paine, and as Pagen it is mentioned many 
times in William's Inventory of Domesday. 
The first two generations of the .\merican 
family (Paines of the Ipswich branch), used 
the coat-of-arms known in English works of 
heraldry as "The Arms of Payne of Market 
Bosworth, county of Leicester, and of the 
county of SufTolk." They were in the fifteenth 
century those of Sir Thomas Payne, Knight 
of Market Bosworth, and of his family only. 
In the "Visitation" of Suffolk county, a work 
originally compiled in 1561, and subsequently 
extended, is found considerable matter treat- 
ing upon this and other old families. Accord- 
ing to various writers they were residents in 
Leicestershire, upon the famous field of Bos- 
worth, where the last great battle of the Roses 



was fought, being one of the places where 
Pagen of Domesday fame had land. 

(I) The first of the family, according to the 
list in the "Visitation," was Sir Thomas 
Payne, knight of Market Bosworth, who mar- 
ried Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Pult- 
ney, knight. He must have been born in the 
early part of the fifteenth century, and had 
three sons, Robert, William and Edmund. 

(II) Edmund, youngest son of Sir Thomas 
Payne, was alive in 1540, the thirty-second 
year of the reign of Henry VIII, at which 
time he had a grandson, then a rich and active 
man. His place of residence was undoubtedly 
at his place of birth, Bosworth. He married 
Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Walton, of 
Leicester county, and had several sons. 

(HI) William, eldest son and heir of Ed- 
mund Paine, removed to Suffolk county, and 
took up his residence at Hengrave, in that 
shire. He carried with him the use of his 
grandfather's coat-of-arms, antl which came to 
be known in heraldric history as a coat or crest 
of Lester, and Suffolk county, and is espe- 
cially known as belonging to "Payne of Hen- 
grave." He was bailiff of the manor in the 
service of Edward Strafford, Duke of Buck- 
ingham. After the death of the latter, he re- 
tired to private life. He married Marjorie, 
daughter of Thomas Ash : children : Henry, 
John, Thomas, George, Nicholas, Edward, An- 
thony, Agatha, Elizabeth, Agnes, Anna and 
Frances. 

(IV) Anthony, seventh son of Williain and 
Marjorie (Ash) Paine, lived at Bury Saint 
Edmunds, at the manor of Nowton, settled 
upon him by his eldest brother, who never 
married. Pie was buried at Nowton, March 3, 
1606. In his will made in the previous month 
he disposed of various properties. He mar- 
ried Martha Castell, who died June 28, 1603; 
children : John, Thomas, William and Ann. 

(V) William (2), third son of Anthony and 
Martha (Castell) Paine, was baptized Decem- 
ber 2, 1555, at Saint Alary's Church, Now- 
ton. He lived at Nowton, parish of Bury 
Saint Edmunds, one of the principal tow'ns of 
Suffolk county. He purchased the manor of 
Nowton for three thousand pounds, and thus 
became lord of the manor, and as such held 
his first court there October 6, 1609, in the 
sixth year of James VI. His last court was 
in 1621, after which he sold out to Sir Daniel 
DeLigne. The public records show that he 
was buried November 21, 1648. and that his 
wife was buried April 29, previous. He must 
have been at the time of his death eighty-three 
vears of age. The records do not establish the

fact that the Aimrican ancestor was the son of 
this WilHani I'ainc, hut every circumstance 
points to that fact. .Among the most conspicu- 
ous of these is the use of the coat-of-arms 
which belonged exclusively to the line. 

(I) William (3), with whom the American 
history of the family begins, was born in Suf- 
folk, England, in 1598-99, probably in the 
parish of Xowton. He was presumably the 
son of William Payne, lord of the manor of 
that place, already slated. I le came to Amer- 
ica in the ship "Increase," Robert Lee, master, 
which sailed from London in April, 1635. He 
was then thirty-seven years of age, and his wife 
Ann forty years of age. They were accom- 
panied by five children, the eldest eleven years 
of age and the youngest eight weeks old. They 
landed at lioston. and at once took up their 
residence in Waterlown, where he was one of 
the earliest inhabitants and was allowed land 
July 25, 1636. This allotment consisted of 
seventy acres, which was the common share 
of each of the one hundred inhabitants. His 
location was on the present Washington street, 
about one-half mile west of Fresh pond. He 
soon acquired other tracts of land and became 
a large landholder. On July 4, 1639, with his 
brother Robert and some others, he procured 
a grant of land at Ipswich, with leave to settle 
a village, and they immediately removed 
thither, and he continued to reside there about 
sixteen years, aiding largely in building up the 
village and town. He was admitted freeman 
of the colony May 13, 1640, and had the title 
of "Mr.," which was rare among the colonists 
in those days. His name is found upon the 
legislative record of the colony from this time. 
In that year he was elected one of the tax 
commissioners; in 1642 was appointed to es- 
tablish the limits of Northend, and about the 
same time to settle the bounds of Hampton 
and Colchester; in 1643 '^^'^^ on a committee to 
determine the bounds of Exeter and Hamp- 
ton, and in 1646 and 1651 to settle matters in 
the latter town. In 1652, he was on a com- 
mittee to settle the line of Dover and Exeter, 
and in 1655 between Hampton and Salisbury. 
In 1645 he was a member of the company in- 
corporated by the general court, known as the 
"free adventurers," for the purpose of ad- 
vancing the settlement of various sections. 
Tliis enterprise he prosecuted throughout his 
life, and it was afterward fostered by his son 
John. At its beginning a grant was made to 
the company of a township of land about fifty 
miles west of Springfield, near Fort Orange, 
on the Hudson river. The Dutch then held 
possession of the fort and river, and one of the 



last acts of l'ayne"s life was a petition to the 
legislature to open negotiations with the Dutch 
government for free navigation of the river to 
New York. William I'ayne was very intimate 
with the governors, Winthrop and Dudley, 
fathers and sons of Massachusetts and Con- 
necticut, and a numerous correspondence be- 
tween him and the Winthrops is preserved. 
After the ileath of (Governor Dudley, Mr. 
Payne became the principal owner of the mills 
at \\'atertown, which had been the first milling 
enterprise in New lingland. It was at first a 
corn mill only, but was afterwards enlarged so 
as to embrace also a fulling mill. In course of 
time Mr. Payne became the owner of three- 
fourths of the Lynn Iron Works, through his 
connection with Governor Winthrop. This 
was the first undertaking of the kind on this 
continent. He was also interested in a similar 
enterprise in Iiraintree, and the inventory of 
his estate showed he died in possession of 
three-fourths of it. He was also interested in 
the iron works at New Haven, of which Gov- 
ernor John Winthrop, junior, was an owner. 
While Mr. Payne did not become an owner, 
he was for many years interested in the opera- 
tion of its business. He was also a part 
owner in five vessels at the time of his death, 
and in the lead mines at Sturbridge. He was 
an extensive owner of lands in various parts 
of the country, including the famous Thomp- 
son Island, in Boston Harbor, now the loca- 
tion of the farm school. He was interested in 
trade at Portsmouth and other points, and his 
farm lands were extensive inTopsfield, Rowley, 
Salem, and a mill privilege in Exeter. He was 
not only interested in manufacturing and farm- 
ing, but during the last few years of his life 
was an active merchant in Boston, having a 
large credit and conducting business on a very 
extensive scale. The inventory of his estate 
shows that he carried an immense stock of 
every variety of goods that could be desired in 
the new country. He appears to have been 
very liberal in giving credit to his neighbors 
and customers, and his estate at death in- 
cluded many doubtful and worthless accounts. 
It is not alone as a business man that Mr. 
Pa_\ne was distinguished. He was a sincere 
professor of religion as indicated both by his 
character and his writings. His property was 
ever treated as a means of advancing public 
weal and it would seem that his investments 
were made with an eye to that object. He 
was public-spirited and a liberal contributor to 
the cause of education. In the promotion of 
this he was one of the most active of the small 
number of men who at that early day took 



76 



STATE OF MAINE. 



measures to establish and endow a free school 
at Ipswich. This has continued to exist, and 
is to-day working upon the fund thus estab- 
lished two and one-half centuries ago. In his 
will he made a bequest of a lot of land at the 
mouth of Ipswich to be held inalienable for- 
ever, and this land is still occupied by an old 
school house on Payne street, which has for 
more than two centuries been devoted to edu- 
cation. Mr. Payne died October lo, 1660, 
leaving a will executed about one week pre- 
viously. He was evidently very weak at this 
time, as the signature is very illegible. In it a 
donation of twenty pounds is made to Harvard 
College, and various bequests to clergymen in 
the vicinity of Boston. His wife Ann sur- 
vived him, but he outlived all his children ex- 
cept one. They were: Susan, William, Han- 
nah, John and Daniel. 

(H) John, second son of Wilham (2) and 
Ann Payne, and the only one who left pos- 
terity, was born 1632, in England, and was 
three years old when he accompanied his pa- 
rents to America. He resided many years m 
Boston, and carried forward the enterprise be- 
gun by his father. He was active in promot- 
ing commerce, and received large grants of 
land for his service in seeking open navigation 
of the Hudson river and for other public ser- 
vices. These lands were on the Hudson river. 
His ser\ ice to the English government in re- 
building Fort James, at the foot of Manhattan 
Island, secured him great favor with the local 
governor antl the powers at home, in expres- 
sion of which he was made sole owner and 
governor for life of Prudence Island, in Nar- 
ragansett Bay, with courts and other machin- 
ery of a free state, in which religion was made 
free. This grant was allegeil to conflict with 
previous Indian grants, and he was arrested by 
the Rhode Island authorities and convicted of 
setting up a foreign government, but was al- 
lowed his liberty on giving up his claim. He 
died at sea in 1675. It is probable that he lost 
his property in litigation, as no record of an 
estate is found. He was married, in 1659, to 
Sarah, daughter of Richard Parker, and re- 
ceived a tract of land from the last named as 
portion of his bride. She probably died before 
her husband. Their children were : William, 
Sarah, Hainiah, Anna and Elizabeth. 

(HI) William (4), only son of John and 
Sarah (Parker). Payne, was born March 15, 
1664, probably in Boston, and passed most of 
his life in Maiden, where he died April 14, 
1741. He married, March 9, 1691, Ruth 
Grover, born 1667, died April 11, 1722. They 
had sons : William and John. 



(IV) William (5), elder son of William 
(4) and Ruth (Grover) Payne, was born No- 
vember 16, 1692, presumably in ^lalden, and 
died January 29, 1784, in Norton, Massachu- 
setts. He was a man of strong constitution 
antl great vigor of mind, determined and ob- 
stinate. Some authorities give him credit for 
living one hundred and five years, and the date 
of his birth is not absolutely certain, but the 
above is approximately correct. When Wash- 
ington's army was stationed in front of Bos- 
ton he was eighty-three years old, and when 
asked why he visited camp, he replied : "I 
come to encourage my son and grandsons, and 
see that they do their duty to their country." 
He resided in that part of Norton which is 
now Mansfield, at a time when it was infested 
with wild animals, and slaughtered many 
wolves. He married (first) April 18, 1717, 
Tabitha Waite, born 1692, died April 7, 1721, 
leaving a son William. He married (second) 
November 6, 1722. Elizabeth Sweetsir, a 
widow. Three of their children are recorded 
in iMalden ; Elizabeth, Edward and Thomas, 
the latter born 1726. No record appears of the 
others except that family tradition gives two, 
Ruth and Susannah. It is probable that there 
were two others. 

(V) William (6), son of William (5) and 
Tabitha (Waite) Paine, was born in JMalden, 
June 25, 1720, died July 17, 181 1, at over 
ninety years of age. He married Mary Bull, 
of Foxboro, in 1743. She died February, 1810. 
They had a married life of sixty-seven years, 
and had twelve children. William was a man 
of great industry and perseverance, of great 
firmness and independence, zealous in religious 
matters, and a loyal patriot. He marched with 
his aged father and two or three of his own 
sons to Boston at the outbreak of the war. It 
is said several of his sons at one time and 
another were engaged in it. It is said of him : 
"He did more with his own hands to make 
this wilderness blossom as a rose than any 
other man in town, and notwithstanding his 
extreme old age he continued to work till 
within a few days of his death." His wife is 
described as a "woman of remarkable strength 
of mind and body, strong mentally and physi- 
cally, strong in her friendships and strong in 
her prejudices, a woman of superior judgment, 
but somewhat of a tyrant, of great personal in- 
dustry, and yet a great reader. Her personal 
appearance was prepossessing, with impressive 
eyes, bright and sparkling to the last." The 
children were: William, November 13, 1743; 
Mary, died in infancy; John, August 20, 1746; 
Lemuel, April 4, 1748; Jacob, February 7,

(VI) Lemuel, son of William (6) and Mary 
(Bull) Paine, was born in .\pril 4, 1748. He 
married Rachel Carpenter, born January 31, 
1757, died September, 1828. Lemuel died at 
Foxboro, December 22, 1794. Children: 
Lemuel, born December 2, 1777, a famous at- 
torney of Maine, and fatlier of Henry W. 
Paine, of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Otis, 
August 16, 1779, an inventor and mechanical 
genius; .\sa. jidy 28, 1781. died in Ijoyhood ;

W. ; Lucas, February 28, 1785, died same day; 
Rachel, August 2, 1789, Mrs. Harvey Part- 
ridge. After the death of Lemuel, his widow 
married (second) Deacon Lsaac Piatt, by 
whom she had three children. 

(VH) Frederick, son of Lemuel and Rachel 
(Carpenter) Paine, was born in Foxboro, 
Alassachusctts, November 21, 1785, died 
March 12, 1857. He married, September 21, 
1809, Abiel Ware, born in Wrentham, Decem- 
ber 6, 1787, died January 12, 1852. Frederick 
removed to Winslow, Maine, with his brother 
Lemuel, and there resided the remainder of his 
life. He was a cooper by trade, but he de- 
voted a large portion of his time to agricul- 
tural pursuits. In 181 5 he was appointed 
postmaster of Winslow, a place he held for 
thirty years. He was for many years treas- 
urer of the town. In 1808 his wife and an- 
other couple alone joined to form a church of 
the Congregational order, and were both ever 
afterward active members. Their house was 
always open for the entertainment of all min- 
isters. They were constant churchgoers, their 
pew being long never vacant and seldom less 
than full. Their religion was free from 
bigotry, liberal in practice, and charitable 
toward all. They had eight children : Charles 
Frederick, Albert Ware, Benjamin Crowning- 
shield, Caroline Matilda, Harriet Newall, Tim- 
othy Otis, the learned restorer of Solomon's 
Temple ; Charlotte Elizabeth ; Sarah Jane. 

(VHI) Albert Ware, son of Frederick and 
Abiel (Ware) Paine, was born at Winslow, 
Maine. August 16, 1812. He was graduated 
from Waterville College, class of 1832. He 
studied law with Hon. Thomas Rice and Gov- 
ernor Samuel Wells, and was admitted to 
practice as an attorney at law in 1835, open- 
ing an office in Bangor, Maine. Here he ever 
afterward resided. Was admitted to practice 
in the supreme court of the L'nited States at 



Washington, h'ebruary 16, 1853, and continued 
without any intermission busily engaged in the 
practice of his profession until his death, De- 
cember 3, 1907, aged ninety-tive years three 
months seventeen days. July 9, 1840, he mar- 
ried Mary Jones Hale, a descendant of Rev. 
John Hale, the early pastor of the church in 
Beverly and Salem, Massachusetts, who had 
so much to do with dispelling the Salem 
Witchcraft delusion. She was born May 8, 
1816, and died April 10, 1901, after a most 
lovely married life of sixty-one years. She 
was a woman of great intelligence, charming 
manner, beautiful in face and expression, re- 
taining the charm and freshness of youth un- 
til the last in an unusual degree. Four daugh- 
ters were born to Albert W. and Mary J. 
(Hale) Paine; Mary Abby, April i, 1841 ; 
Selma Ware, December 24, 1847; Lydia Au- 
gusta, January 10, 1850, and Eugenie Hale, 
i\Iay I, 1853. Three of the daughters re- 
mained at home with their parents, where they 
still reside. Lydia Augusta married, October 
29, 1872, Henry H. Carter, of' Boston ; they 
have two children : Albert Paine, December 
13, 1873, and Martha, January i, 1876. 

The passing hours of December 3, 1907, 
marked the closing scenes of the life of Albert 
Ware Paine, the most remarkable man of that 
bright galaxy of legal stars who gave to the 
bar of Maine such a commanding position in 
judicial history. For seventy-two years since 
1835, h^ 1^^<J been in the practice of his loved 
profession, and for at least seventy of those 
years in constant, active, untiring practice be- 
fore local, circuit, state, supreme and United 
States supreme courts. Even the last two 
years were not spent in idleness. He retained 
a seat in his old office and looked after the 
interests of a few old clients (principally es- 
tates), attended to his own personal affairs, 
wrote and published a work on "Mt. Hope 
Cemetery," and wrote often for the newspa- 
pers and periodicals to which he was a wel- 
come contributor. Only a very few days be- 
fore he laid down his pen forever, a letter 
written by him appeared in a Boston paper, in 
which he called on President Roosevelt to ac- 
cept another term. His capacity for work was 
enormous. Said one of his contemporaries, 'T 
do not see how he can accomplish so much ; 
how does he do it?" Not only in the applica- 
tion and the administration of law was he 
great and skilful, but deeply interested and 
useful was he in the enactment of new laws 
which would tend to a better application of 
the principles of justice, for to him law meant 



78 



STATE OF MAINE. 



Justice, and the statutes of not onh- Maine, but 
the whole world are enriched by one enact- 
ment, the product of his brain and pen. 

Mr. Paine was the author of many laws and 
amendments. Among others he drafted, had 
presented and effected the enactment of the 
following statutes : An act to abolish the dis- 
tinction between counsellors and attorneys at 
law ; an act to exempt stockholders of cor- 
porations from personal liability ; an act pro- 
viding for compulsory fire inquests ; acts re- 
lating to saving banks law ; an act relating to 
taxation of insurance companies ; an act to 
■establish an insurance department ; an act to 
exempt insurance policies from United States 
bankruptcy proceedings ; an act to protect 
family burying grounds. 

Mr. Paine was also most largely instru- 
mental in originating and passing a beneficent 
law- — that allowing criminals to testify in their 
own behalf. Before 1864, no criminal could 
■utter a word in his own defense in any court 
■of law in the world. But it must be, where 
the injustice and the need of reform are so 
great, that more than one would independently 
recognize that need, and strive or wish to re- 
form it ; and, as the authorship of this law is 
claimed for another, Mr. Paine's connection 
with it should be simply and exactly stated. 
Its history extends over many years. 

During his early life in Winslow he became 
cognizant of the case of a boy who had been 
unjustly accused, convicted and sentenced for 
a theft which he had not committed, but the 
proof of it was not found until he had lived a 
convict for three years, and hatl died with 
the shadow of disgrace upon him. It could 
not have happened had the criminal been al- 
lowed to testify in his own behalf. This, then, 
was Mr. Paine's inspiration ; a most painful 
and impressive experience before his college 
life was ended; a deep conviction that justice 
was not justice under such conditions — a con- 
viction, however, which he allowed twenty 
years of legal practice and constant advo- 
cacy to assure before he thought the time ripe 
for the accomplishment of reform. 

In 1859 j\Ir. Paine drafted his bill, carried 
it to Augusta, and caused it to be presented 
by Mr. A. G. Lebroke, a former law student 
of his, and a member of the House of Rep- 
resentatives. There he labored hard for its 
passage only to see it go down in defeat. 
Nothing daunted, he returned in i860, 1861, 
1862 and 1863, causing the subject to be 
introduced again and referred to a committee 
before which he argued the case each year 
anew. Again he went in 1864. During that 



session the proposed law became a matter of 
much interest, and met the support of the pub- 
lic quite generally. Other friends also had 
been raised to favor the bill (among them 
Mr. \'inlon, of Grey, whose name has since 
been used in connection with it), and, although 
not without strong opposition, it was passed 
at that session. After six years of labor, 
dating from the time the first bill was intro- 
duced, a law was passed providing that no 
person in the state of Maine could be sent to 
the gallows or to prison without having the 
right to tell his story to the jury. 

After the success in Maine, Mr. Paine 
brought the subject before the people by cor- 
respondence with the Boston Daily Advertiser, 
and John Quincy Adams requested him "to 
write out an ideal statute containing the pro- 
vision of the Maine Criminal law." He com- 
plied. Mr. Adams immediately presented to 
the Massachusetts House what had been writ- 
ten, urging upon it the need of such a statute. 
It met with instant favor, and, with an addi- 
tion, was carried the very forenoon of its 
presentation. Here ended Mr. Paine's direct 
service in the cause, but the law itself spread 
to other states, to the Canadian Provinces, and 
on to England and France. 

The authorship of this law is claimed for 
Chief Justice Appleton. Judge Appleton was 
Mr. Paine's deeply honored friend, and it must 
be that the advocacy, in written and spoken 
words, of one of Judge Appleton's eminence 
and character, wide influence and judicial ex- 
perience, one so universally esteemed and 
trusted, was a very potent factor in forming 
that public opinion on which is based the pas- 
sage of a law. 

j\Ir. Paine was also working to procure an 
act to legalize voting by proxy in public elec- 
tions. He had also agitated and had inter- 
ested such men as Senator Hoar, of Massa- 
chusetts, in an amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States, providing for the suc- 
cession to the Presidency in the event of the 
death of the President elect before Inaugura- 
tion Day. The joint resolution for this con- 
stitutional amendment, in which Senator Hoar 
embodied the resolution originated and sent 
him by Mr. Paine, and which he, in commit- 
tee, amended only to make it apply also to 
another closely allied defect to be remedied, 
passed the senate May 4, 1898. In the House 
of Representatives it was referred to the Com- 
mittee on the Judiciary, May 5th, but was 
never voted on in the House itself, and Mr. 
Paine, with his customary persistency in such 
matters, did not cease to urge its passage on

senators and representatives, to liis very la.-^t 
year. 

The public offices held by Mr. I'aine were: 
Dank and Insurance IC.xauiiner, 1869-70; 
State Insurance Commissioner, 1871-73; Tax 
Commissioner, 1874: and he was alderman in 
Bangor in 1861. While holding these offices, 
Mr. Paine prosecuted his law business, labor- 
ing harder and longer. He neglected neither 
his public nor his private business. While his 
life was chiefly devoted to his professional 
duties, he varied them by contribulit)ns from 
his pen to magazines and [leriodicals. lie 
wrote a great deal on current and legal topics, 
varying this by an occasional book. 1 le was a 
Swedenborgian in religion, and a volume writ- 
ten and published by him, entitled "The New 
Philosopliy," is a book of religious views, 
especially showing the author's belief in the 
intimate and close relations existing between 
the inhabitants of the material and the spirit- 
ual worlds. Other works were: "The Paine 
Genealogy," "History of Mount Hope Ceme- 
tery" (This being written in his ninety-fifth 
year) ; various Bank and Insurance Commis- 
sion Reports, Insurance Commission Reports, 
and Tax Commission Reports, and he was the 
only correspondent of'^the Aroostook War. 
Aside from his official reports, his writings 
were his recreation. In his profession, he 
argued cases before the Supreme Court in 
Washington, also before the Circuit and Dis- 
trict Courts of the United States, and before 
the State Courts of Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, New York and Minnesota. The 
whole number of cases he argued was in ex- 
cess of five hundred, more than three hundred 
of which are reported in the "Maine Reports." 
He tried or argued cases before every Judge 
of the Court of Common Pleas, the District 
Court and the Supreme Court of Maine, who 
has been seated on the bench since Maine be- 
came a state, excepting only one who left the 
bench before Mr; Paine's admission. His 
cases were notable, and the decisions given 
were of the greatest importance. He tried 
causes involving question of title respecting 
almost every dam or mill privilege on the 
Penobscot river. In fact, all questions of 
more than ordinary importance fountl him en- 
gaged by one side or the other. Early in life 
Mr. Paine resolved to seek or accept no office 
that would interfere with his work as a law- 
yer, and this explains why he never held pub- 
lic elective office. For over forty years he 
was one of the directors of the Maine Tele- 
graph Company, and in 1876 was elected presi- 
dent. In iSs- he was elected treasurer of the 



Mt. Hope Cemetery Corporation, holding that 
position for fifty years. He was senior mem- 
ber of the I'enobscot bar, and president, and 
since 1859 its treasurer and librarian for many 
years. i\lany parcels of land in Bangor were 
in his professional care, and he laid out and 
named many of the city streets. The Soldiers' 
Cemetery and Monument were the result of 
his suggestion. While attorney for the Land 
Office, Air. Paine performed a service to the 
citizens of Maine that cannot be overestimated, 
when he secured from a refuse heap in the 
State House at Boston, Massachusetts, the 
early records, documents and plans of lands 
in all parts of Maine. These records involved 
the titles to lots in I>angor and other towns, 
and descriptions of early surveys. Two large 
drygoods boxes of these valuable maps and 
papers were recovered, but only after legisla- 
tive and legal steps had been taken to compel 
Massachusetts to surrender them. They have 
since been bound into volumes and preserved 
in the Maine Land Office — a rich inheritance 
for the citizens, the titles to whose homes is 
there largely to be found. But for Mr. Paine's 
zeal these valuable papers would have been 
irrevocably lost. 

Much could be said concerning Mr. Paine's 
professional life, but the greater part must be 
left unsaid. Suffice it to say that he always 
believed in the justice of his cause, and the in- 
tegrity of his client, and his services were 
sought and obtained by the very best class of 
men and corporations. His business was not 
to tear down and defeat the purpose of exist- 
ing laws, but to upbuild and perfect where he 
saw weakness. His life was open and above 
reproach. One said of him : "I preach Albert 
W. Paine to the boys." No grander eulogy 
could be uttered. His home was his haven 
of rest, and "a constant source of happiness 
and refreshment." He left professional cares 
at the office, and in his home and garden (of 
which he was very fond) obtained social 
recreation and healthy rest for the duties of the 
morrow. None ever saw him angry, yet none 
could intimidate him. "By common consent he 
was an honest, honorable man, an upright 
member of society, a model head of a family, 
a loyal citizen of the Republic, of simple tastes 
and high ideals." "Without that bright spark 
we call genius, he accomplished results by 
indefatigable labor and industry, what others 
of a higher order of talent to do." An oil 
portrait of Mr. Paine hangs in the library 
of the Supreme Court of Maine. He was a 
man of most temperate habits in everything. 
A strong supporter of Maine's prohibitory

law, and a total abstainer himself, he was not 
fanatical in his views nor intolerant of the 
rights of others. A most independent thinker 
on religious and political questions, he ac- 
corded cheerfully to others the same inde- 
pendent freedom of thought and action. In 
early days he was anti-slavery in his views. 
As a Whig, he joined the Republican party 
at its formation, and always remained true 
to that party. He was of a most sunny, gen- 
ial disposition, of a witty and humorous turn 
of mind, and one who inspired warm friend- 
ships. In the latter respect, he gave freely 
from the depths of a loving heart, and in 
return received the love and affection of men, 
as well as the unvarying respect of his col- 
leagues and acquaintances. The character of 
his age was remarkable (even five years be- 
fore his death it had become customary to 
call him the oldest practicing lawyer in the 
United States, although the truth of such 
statements cannot be proved absolutely — and 
the practice was not active), yet that character 
was but the culmination of a long, fruitful 
life, true to its own principle of thought and 
action. While the years greatly impaired his 
hearing and slightly lessened his memory of 
unimportant names, they left his step quick, 
his voice and hand firm, and his eye strong 
to serve him in reading and writing all day 
long if need be. He and his pen were very 
intimate, and they worked with wonderful 
ease and harmony together. He talked a 
great deal with thought and wit and sense, 
and had the unfailing courtesy of his kindli- 
ness and his smiling countenance. Yet he 
usually had, within, some serious project he 
was brooding. His judgment and mind seemed 
to strengthen with his rich experience and 
practice of a lifetime, and he had always a 
conscious, grateful joy in life itself, and the 
promise of the life to come. On being wished 
a centenary, he said: "Providence willing, I 
hope for that favor." In all his fourscore and 
fifteen years, the day never came, unless in 
temporary illness, or to the last week, when 
he did not rise to meet the morn, full of en- 
ergy and enthusiastic interest for what he had 
planned to bring to pass that day. He did 
not load himself with resentments of any kind. 
He condemned no one, and he always found 
some well-reasoned allowance for the delin- 
quent. He reserved all his resentment for un- 
just laws. His ideal of happiness to all eter- 
nity was useful service ; and, very useful, faith- 
ful and full of faith, and joyous — he helped to 
make the world better for ninety-five years. 



To no one more truly than to him can be ap- 
plied the words : He "kept at eve the faith ot 
morn." 



The Smalls were intimately con- 
SAIiVLL nected with the earliest history of 
Maine and New Hampshire. 
They were of English blood, and brought with 
them the traditions of a valiant ancestry. In 
the year 1330, John and William Small, of 
Dartmouth, were flatteringly mentioned in an 
act under Edward III, and some of their 
descendants seemed to have resided there con- 
tinuously to this day. There were also rec- 
ords in 1682 of Smalls in Gloucestershire, 
England, who claimed to be of the same or- 
igin as the Smalleys of Leicestershire. In the 
early York deeds we find that the name has 
been spelled Smale, Small, and Smalley — 
these dififerent spellings having been used by 
the same men. It is not to be wondered at 
that some branches of this family have adopted 
the form Smalley. 

(I) Edward Small, who came to America 
about 1632, was probably from Dartmouth, or 
some other point in Devonshire, England, 
where the family has long been one of high 
character and position. He is said to have 
come under the auspices of his kinsman. Sir 
Ferdinando Gorges. He, with Champernown 
and others, founded Piscataqua, which was 
afterwards divided into the Maine towns of 
Kittery, Eliot, South Berwick, and Berwick. 
Edward Small was at the first general court 
at Saco in 1640, also member of the grand 
jury the same year. His name was entered 
on the list as "Edward Small, gent." We find 
him at old Falmouth, Maine, in 1640; a magis- 
trate there in 1645; and that afterwards he 
was at the Isle of Shoals. He was one of 
the magistrates of the general court held at 
Saco, October 21, 1645. He seems to have 
built a house in Piscataqua before 1643, as 
the grant of one hundred acres made to him 
July 25, 1643, by Thomas Gorges, deputy 
governor of the Province of Maine (in be- 
half of Sir Ferdinando Gorges Kt. Ld., pro- 
prietor of said province) was specified as "ly- 
ing between two crickes of each side of the 
house of the said Edward Small, and so back- 
ward to Sturgeon Crick," five shillings vearly 
being payment for the same. Five years later, 
June 23, 1647, Edward Small sold' this tract 
of land and "my dwelling house field" to An- 
tipus Maverick, for forty-five pounds. No 
mention of wife or children is found in any 
deed or record. The last mention we find of

him is in the Isle of Shoal>, in 1653. He 
probably returiieil to England. 

(II) Francis Small, who may be regarded as 
the ancestor of the Small family of Maine, 
may have been son of Edward Small, but of 
this we have no proof. He came to America 
about 1632. He was baptized in England, 
October 6, 1C25. He may have been named 
for Captain Francis Champernown, whose 
father, Arthur Champernown, was owner of 
large grants of land in Maine and New Hamp- 
shire. Francis Champernown died in 16S7, 
aged seventy-three. He had no children of 
his own, so willed his large estates to his 
wife (who was the widow of Robert Cutt) 
and to her children. He also gave to Eliza- 
beth Small, "my servant maid, in behalf of 
what I formerly promised her," thirty acres 
of land at Spruce Creek ; also ten pounds in 
cattle and ten pounds in goods. Elizabeth 
Small may have been a sister of Francis. She 
was the wife of Thomas Hooper, of York, 
when she sold this piece of land to Henry Bar- 
ter, of Kittery, March 5, 1697-98. Francis 
Small was living in Dover, New Hampshire, 
in 1648, with his wife Elizabeth. In 1657 
he was a resident of Falmouth, Maine. The 
earliest Indian deed of land in Falmouth was 
made July 27, 1657, by Scitterygussett, to 
Francis Small. It reads thus : "Bee it knowne 
unto all men by these presents, that I Scittery- 
gussett of Casco Bay Sagamore, do hereby 
grant, sell &c all that upland and Marshes at 
Capissicke, Lying up along the Northerne 
side of the river unto the head thereof & so 
to reach & extend unto ye river side of Amme- 
cungan." Francis Small bound himself 
"yearly to pay unto ye said Scitterygussett 
Sagamore, during his life, one Trading coate 
for Capussicke & one Gallone of Lyquors for 
Animomingan." May 10, 1658, Francis Small 
assigned one-half of this land to John Phil- 
lips, of Boston. July 13, 1658, the "Inhabi- 
tants of Black Poynt, Bleu Point, Spurwink 
and Cascoe Bay owned themselves subject to 
the Government of J\lass. Bay in N. E." 
Francis Small headed this list, and was one 
of the few whose names were written without 
a mark. November 2, 1658, he sold to Isaac 
Walker, of Boston, "the plantation lately 
bought of Richard IMartyn, called Alartyn's 
Point, over against Clapboard Island." He 
had a grant of one hundred acres of land in 
that part of Kittery called Newichawannock, 
also two hundred and two acres on eastern 
side of the Piscataqua river. (See deed to his 
son Daniel Small, of Truro, Mass., dated Oc- 
tober 31, 1712.) 



In tile year 1659, Francis Small "was 
employed by Major Nicholas Shapleigh to 
purchase a certain great Ysland called Se- 
bascoe Diggin, lying against a Necke of 
land called Merriconeag." He built a 
house there "by order of Major Shapleigh 
and possessed the Ysland in his l)ehalf. ' 
"This was called Small's Island." May 10, 
1683, Francis Small, senior, aged about fifty- 
six, and his wife Elizabeth, aged about forty- 
nine, testified to the above facts. They had 
one child born there, which was the "first white 
child of English parents" born in that part of 
Maine. Francis Small was again attorney 
for Falmouth in 1663. He was living in Kit- 
tery in 1668, but he had a house and trading 
camp where the village of Cornish now is. 
This was doubtless the first house built in 
that town or in any part of the Ossipee lands. 
"In the summer of 1668, Francis Small sold 
goods to the Newichawannoch tribe of Indians 
on credit, to be paid for in furs in the autumn ; 
but when the time of payment drew near the 
red men deemed it easier to kill Small than 
to pay him, and they decided to fire his house 
and shoot him when he came out to escape 
the flames. Cai)tain Sunday, the chief of the 
tribe, was friendly to Small, and told him what 
the Indians were to do, and advised him to 
flee for his life. Small thought the tale a 
cunningly devised fable to frighten him away 
in order to avoid payment ; but when night 
came, thinking it wise to be on the side of 
safety, he secreted himself in some pines on 
the hill near by, and watched through the 
long November night. With the coming of 
the (lawn, a flame of fire shot up from the 
burning house, whereupon Small took flight 
and paused not until he reached his home in 
Kittery. Chief Sunday followed Small to Kit- 
tery, and there made good the loss, by selling 
to him the entire Ossipee tract of land. The 
deed was dated November 28, 1668. The 
signature of Captain Sunday was a turtle. It 
conveyed to Francis Small "my great tract of 
land at Osobe containing twenty miles square 
and lying between the two rivers of great 
Osobe, and Little Ossipee, so called, and being 
the same land where the said Francis Small's 
trading house now stands, and from the river 
Meehewonock near Humphrey Chadbourne's 
logging camp, and to extend Northerly and 
Easterly to Saco river." The consideration 
was "two large Indian blankets, Two gallons 
Rum, Two pounds powder, four pounds of 
]\Iuscet Balls, and twenty string of Indian 
beads, with several other articles." This deed 
is still in existence, and was recorded in 1773,

when one hundred and five years old. Francis 
Small conveyed one undivided half of the Os- 
sipee lands to Major Nicholas Shapleigh; and 
the other half to his son Samuel, April 30, 
171 1. These lands were divided between the 
heirs of F"rancis Small and Nicholas Shap- 
leigh, about 1 78 1. It is now incorporated in 
the towns of Limington, Limerick, Cornish, 
Parsonsfield and Newfield. Cornish was first 
named Francisborough. 

Francis Small had wife Elizabeth in 1648, 
when they were living in Dover, New Hamp- 
shire. No record of marriage has been found, 
but it is probable that she was a Leighton. 
Their children were : Edward, married' Mary 
Woodman, of Dover, New Hampshire; Fran- , 

cis, married Elizabeth , and died in 

Truro, Massachusetts, 1709; Samuel, born 
about 1664, in Kittery, Maine; (see forward) ; 

Benjamin, married Rebecca and went 

to Harwich, Massachusetts ; Daniel, a car- 
penter of Truro; Massachusetts, in 1712; was 
of Provincetown, Massachusetts, February, 
1729-30; Elizabeth, married j\iarch 7, 1704-05, 
John Pugsley, of Dover, New Hampshire; 
Alice, married Thomas Wormwood ; and 
Mary, born about 1654, married Nicholas 
Frost, before 1677. Francis Small went to 
Cape Cod to spend his last years, with his 
son Daniel, and died there about 1713, "be- 
ing about 93 years of age." 

(Ill) Samuel, son of Francis Small and 
Elizabeth (Leighton ?) Small, was born about 
1664, in Kittery, Maine. He was living there 
in 1737, and may have reached an age as 
great as his father. A deposition of Samuel 
Small, dated November 11, 1737, "aged about 
seventy-three years," testifies that in his youth 
he was a servant to Henry Jocelyn several 
years at Pemaquid. He may have remained 
there until the death of Mr. Jocelyn, in 1683. 
He had grants of land in Kittery in 1694-99, 
of one hundred acres. He lived at Sturgeon 
Creek. He bought of Peter Wittum, Decem- 
ber 12, 1696, sixteen acres on the southwest 
side of Sturgeon Creek, with house and or- 
chard. He was still living there in 1728 
(when he deeded it to his beloved son Joseph 
to be his "after my decease"). He had a 
grant of thirty-eight acres at Sturgeon creek 
on the 4th day of March, 1699-1700, which he 
sold to James Davis, October 31, 1727. He 
was one of the most respected men of the 
town. He was a witness to many deeds and 
wills, and helped settle many estates. No doubt 
he was an early member of the Berwick Con- 
gregational church, as his name is in the list 
of members June 4, 1702, the day that the 



new- meeting house was dedicated. In 171 1 
he received the deed of the Ossipee lands 
from his father, Francis Small. It may be 
well to mention here that when Francis Small 
was over ninety years old and too feeble to 
sign his name, he gave a deed of these same 
lands to his son Daniel (dated October 31, 
1712). This deed was proved invalid. Sam- 
uel Small married, before 1694, Elizabeth 
Chadbourne. widow of James Chadbourne, 
and daughter of Ensign James Heard. Their 
children were born in Kittery, and were: 
Elizabeth, born November 9, 1695, married 
Benjamin ?^Iarch, February 10, 1713-14; Sam- 
uel Jr., born April 17, 1700 (see forward). 
Joseph, born December 3, 1702, married Mary 
Libby, April 12, 1722; and Mary, baptized 
May 27, 1707, married Solomon Davis, of 
Marblehead, October 15, 1720. 

(IV) Deacon Samuel (2), second child 
of Samuel (i) and Elizabeth (Heard) Small, 
was born at Kittery, Maine, April 17, 1700. 
When but a lad he displayed all the sturdy 
characteristics of his long line of noble an- 
cestry. He threaded the pathways of the for- 
ests to the north and w-est, and sailed far 
along the eastern coast. He was the third 
and last single owner of the famous Ossipee 
lands. He was very active in the organization 
of the First Congregational Church in Scar- 
boro (where he made his home after 1726), 
and was its first deacon in 1728. He was 
chosen clerk of Scarboro in 1727, and with 
the single exception of 1775, when he was 
probably absent from home attending to mat- 
ters in connection with the coming war, he 
was clerk every year until 1779 — a period of 
fifty-two years. And strange as it may seem 
to us, he was usually moderator of the meet- 
ings also. He was usually one of the select- 
men, and a member of all important commit- 
tees. In 1786, when carrying the weight of 
eighty-six years, he was moderator of the 
meeting for the last time ; and when at the 
ripe old age of ninety years, he for the last 
time served on a committee. For sixty-three 
years his was the most conspicuous name 
on the Scarljoro records. Deacon Samuel 
was very active in matters which led up to 
the revolutionary war, and was so extremely 
enthusiastic in the cause of liberty that he 
recorded the entire Declaration of Independ- 
ence in the town clerk's book. At the age of 
seventv-eight vears he was at the head of the 
committee of correspondence, inspection and 
safety, and at the age of seventy-nine years 
he was a member of the convention at Cam- 
bridge to form a state government. The

date of his deatli is unknown, but his years 
probably equalled those of his grandfather 
Francis, who dieil at the age of ninety-three. 
He was buried in the old cemetery at Scar- 
boro, and a stone marks the spot. 

He married, January 17, 1716-17, Anna 
Hatch, of Tortsmouth, New Hampshire, 
daughter of Captain John Hatch. A reason 
for this early marriage is to be found in the 
fact that her father died about the time of 
her birth ; and her only brother died in Au- 
gust, 1716, leaving her without a home. No 
doubt she was welcomed to her new home by 
the parents of her husband. Samuel Small Sr. 
deeded to his son Samuel a ])ortion of the 
homestead land at Sturgeon Creek, July 9, 
1719. Their children, as recorded on Kittery 
records, were : Samuel, see forward ; Anna ; 
John ; Joshua ; and Elizabeth. The others, 
born in Scarboro, were Sarah, Benjamin, 
James and Alary. 

(V) Samuel (3), oldest son of Deacon 
Samuel (2) and Anna (Hatch) Small, of 
Scarboro, Maine, was born May 26, 1718, in 
Kittery, Maine, but went to Scarboro with his 
parents when about ten years old. Like his 
father, he was deacon in the Congregational 
church, and was town clerk. He was chief 
justice of Cumberland county court of com- 
mon pleas. In 1773 his father divided the 
Ossipee lands, giving to him and his brother 
Joshua three-eighths each, and to Benjamin 
(son of this Samuel) one-twelfth. These three 
men went up to Limington and took posses- 
sion of their ancestral acres. After a contest 
in the courts, the Indian deed was pronounced 
valid, and their title perfect. Samuel Small 
married, February 16, 1741-42, Dorothy, 
daughter of Captain Richard Hubbard, of 
Kingston, New Hampshire, born June 25, 
1723. Their children were all born in Scar- 
boro : Abigail, Benjamin, Sarah, Samuel, 
Francis, Martha, Dorothy, James, Willam (see 
forward), Anna and Dorothy. 

(VI) William, son of Deacon Samuel (3) 
and Dorothy (Hubbard) Small, was born 
June 8, 1759, in Scarboro, Maine, and died 
about 1833, in Limington, Maine. He always 
resided in Limington, was a manufacturer of 
shoes, and a most highly respected citizen. His 
home was one of truest joy and peace ; nothing 
delighted him more than to help his neigh- 
bors, and give a cordial greeting to all 
strangers who came to the town. William 
Small married (first) January 7, 1782, Mary 
March, born August 29, 1761, in Scarboro, 
Maine, and died October 16, 1794, in Liming- 
ton, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Samuel 



March, of Scarboro. a brave soldier of the 
revolutionary war (and granddaughter of 
Benjamin March, who married Elizabeth 
Small, and great-granddaughter of Samuel 
Small (I\'') and Mrs. Ivlizabeth Chadbourne.) 
William Small married (second) Novetnber i, 
1795, Sarah March, born January 22, 1771, in 
Scarboro, and died May 3, 1849, '" Calais, 
Maine (sister of Mary March). The children 
of the first marriage of William Small were : 
Sarah, Eunice, Mary, Martha, Anna, Samuel, 
and twins — Lucy and Jane. The children of 
William Small's second marriage were : Will- 
iam, James, Issacher, Abner, Eliza, Lavinia, 
John IM. and Harriet N. 

William Small was a revolutionary soldier, 
serving as a private in Captain Benjamin Lar- 
rabee's company, under command of Colonel 
John Mitchell, in 1773: a private in Captain 
Roger Libby's company in 1779; also sergeant 
in Captain John Andrew's company, unrler 
Brigadier General Wadsworth, in 1780. He 
made an application for pension July 30, 1832, 
at which time he was seventy-three years of 
age, and was allowed for nine months' service. 
(VII) Abner, son of William Small and 
of his second wife, Sarah March, w-as born 
in Limington, Maine, October 27, 1802, and 
died November 17, 1867, in Gardiner, Maine. 
He was an alert and active business man — a 
man of truly patriotic spirit, and was one of 
the most highly esteemed citizens of Gardiner. 
He joined Adoniram Lodge, Free and Ac- 
cepted Masons, at Limington, Maine, in 1824, 
and in 1826 became a member of Hermon 
Lodge, in Gardiner, Maine. He was one of 
thirty-two members who stood firmly by the 
lodge during the Morgan excitement. He 
lived for several years in Mount Vernon, 
Maine; was made master of Vernon Valley 
Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, and served 
as postmaster under two administrations. He 
was also commissioned a captain in the state 
militia. Abner Small married, in 1832, Mary 
Ann Benard Randall, born in Gardiner, Maine, 
October 21, 1805, died February 28, r88i, in 
West Waterville, Maine, daughter of Benja- 
min Randall and Mary Hill Webber. She 
was a woman of gentle and refined character, 
and a devoted member of Christ Church, Gar- 
diner. Their children were: i. Hampton 
Dunreath Plumer, born May 31, 1833: grad- 
uate of Waterville College ; died August 23, 
1862. 2. Abner Randall, born May i, 1836; 
see forward. 3. Emilus Norris Dumont. born 
June 8, 1842; a brave lieutenant in the Sec- 
ond Maine Cavalry in the civil war. He was

was born May i, 1836, in Gardiner, Maine. 
When a boy he changed his middle name to 
Ralph. He has been a resident of Oakland, 
Maine, since i860 — one of the noblest sons of 
the old Pine Tree State, beloved by all who 
know him, for his energetic character, sturdy 
patriotism, strict honesty, warm hospitality, 
and other fine qualities. 

"?\Iajor Abner Randall Small was first mus- 
tered into the United States volunteer service 
as a private in Company G, Third Maine In- 
fantry, in June, 1861. He was speedily pro- 
moted corporal, then sergeant. In June, 1862, 
he received further promotion by being com- 
missioned and mustered into the United States 
service as first lieutenant and adjutant, to be 
assigned, and later was mustered in as adju- 
tant of the Sixteenth Maine Infantry. In 
December, 1862, he was assigned to duty as 
aide-de-camp on the staff of Colonel Adrian 
R. Root, commanding First Brigade, Second 
Division, First Army Corps. While thus serv- 
ing he was complimented with a well-deserved 
special mention for his distinguished gallantry 
displayed in the battle of Fredericksburg. On 
July 1st, 1863, he was also appointed assistant 



adjutant general, same brigade. Later on he 
received special mention in general orders for 
his brave conduct in the battle of Gettysburg, 
which has been well described in many papers 
and histories. He also participated in all the 
battles in which his regiment was engaged 
until taken and held prisoner from August 
i8th, 1864, to February 22nd, 1865. In the 
meantime he was commissioned major, Octo- 
ber, 1864, of the same command. Thus he 
was with his regiment, the Sixteenth Maine, 
from the time of its organization until it W'as 
mustered out, June 5th, 1865. 

"It is needless to say of Alajor Small that 
his record is one of sterling honor. His mili- 
tary skill and ardor, his devotion to the best 
welfare of his regiment, his lofty and unflag- 
ging patriotism, and his conspicuous gallantry, 
have placed his name on the roll of the most 
distinguished ofiicers who aided to put down 
the rebellion." His fine military record is 
contained in Report of Adjutant General of 
Maine, vol. i, p. 456, and U. S. Official War 
Records — Gettysburg, series i, vol. xxvii, p. 
293, and Fredericksburg, series i, vol. xxi, pp. 
487, 489. 

After the civil war, ]\lajor Small settled in 
Oakland, Maine. He was for thirty-three 
years treasurer of the Somerset Railway Com- 
pany, and for many years one of its directors ; 
first clerk and treasurer of the Madison Wool- 
en Company since 1892, and accountant of 
the Dunn Edge Tool Company, since 1868. 
Major Small is a charter member of De Molay 
Commandery of Knights Templar, also a mem- 
ber of the Military (/)rder of the Loyal Le- 
gion of the United States, and of the ?».Iaine 
Society of the Sons of the American Revolu- 
tion. 

Major Small married (first) Julia Maria 
Fairbanks, in 1865. He married (second) 
October 24, 1888, Medora Frances Clark, 
who was born February 15, 1850, in Gardiner, 
Maine, daughter of Nathaniel Clark Jr. and

Abigail (Dennett) Clark, was born May 14, 
1756, in Kittery, Maine, and died August 12, 
1847, in Liniing-ton, Maine. He married, Au- 
gust, 1784. Lucy Small, burn February 11, 
1763, in Scarborougli, Maine; died June, 
1827, in Limington, ilaine. .She was daughter 
of Joshua Small and Susanna (Kennard) 
Small, of Scarborough and Limington, Maine. 
Their children were: Nathaniel, Samuel, John, 
Mary, Edward, Ephraim, Lucy, Eliot (died 
young), Asenath and Eliot. 

Ephraim Clark inherited a spirit of adven- 
ture and daring from his Small ancestors, 
which found full scope in the revolutionary 
war. His record was a remarkable one. He 
enlisted November 17, 1776, as seaman on the 
privateer "Dalton," was captured on her and 
taken to Plymouth, England, and put in Mill 
Prison, where he remained till March 15, 
1779; when with other prisoners he was taken 
to Nantes, France, to be exchanged. He en- 
listed April 5, 1779, for one year's service, 
on Continental frigate ".\lliance," Captain 
Pierre Landais, in tlie Beet under Commodore 
Paul Jones, and was in the fight September 
23, 1779. when the "Serapis" and "Countess 
of Scarboro," British frigates, were captured. 
He was taken prisoner October 9, 1779, and 
taken to Fortune prison, Portsmouth, England. 
He escaped and went to Cherbourg, France, 
May 3, 1780. He was on the cutter "Marquis 
Marbeck," a privateer under American colors 
sailing from Dunkirk, France, when she was 
captured September 9, 1781, by a British ves- 
sel, and he was taken again to Mill Prison in 
England. He was exchanged, and arrived at 
Marblehead, Massachusetts, August, 1782. In 
1784 he was living in Kittery, Maine. He 
settled in Limington, Maine, and owned a 
farm. 

He was pensioned July 4, 1820. and 
again in 1832. His grandsons spent many 
happy hours at the old homestead listening to 
the stories of his hairbreadth escapes and ad- 
ventures by sea and land. It is related of 
him that when almost ninety years old he 
offered to teach one of his grandchildren to 
dance, saying: "When I was young I gave 
dancing lessons in France." Two rare old 
books, written by comrades of Ephraim Clark, 
contain much of interest about the infamous 
Old Mill Prison and the prisoners confined in 
its walls, viz. : "Memoirs of Rev. Andrew 
Sherburne" and "Diary of Charles Her- 
bert." 

(VI) Nathaniel (2), eldest son of Ephraim 
and Lucy (Small) Clark, was born in Liming- 



ton, Maine, December 24, 178-;, and died there 
March 6, 1850. lie married, October 13, 1808, 
Martha Small, daughter of William Small and 
his first wife Mary March. She was born 
June 15, 1788, in Limington, and died there 
January 20, 1826. Their children were : Ira, 
Julia A., Charles, Harriet S. and Nathaniel. 
Nathaniel Clark Sr. married (second) Octo- 
ber 22, 1826, Mary Gilpatrick (Adams) Small, 
widow of David Small. Their children were 
Lewis, Martha, George A., Julia A., Cordelia 
and Sarah. He was one of the charter mem- 
bers of Adoniram Lodge, Free and Ac- 
cepted Masons, of Limington. The lodge 
erected a monument to his memory in 1850. 
He was a very genial man, kind and upright, 
and highly respected in the community. He 
was a manufacturer of boots and shoes. He 
was chorister of the Baptist church for many 
years. 

(VII) Nathaniel (3), son of Nathaniel 
(2) Clark and his wife, Martha (Small) 
Clark, was born in Limington, Maine, June 
10, 1821, and died October 30, 1902, in Oak- 
land, Maine, at the home of his daughter, 
Mrs. A. R. Small. He was married in Hal- 
lowell, Maine, August 21, 1848, to Maria Ann

uary II, 1825, daughter of Captain John and

cember 9, 1901. Mr. Clark was in the boot 
and shoe business in Gardiner, Maine, for over 
twenty years, being a member of the firm of 
Cox & Clark for several years. He was then 
in business alone, and was honored for his 
strict integrity and his blameless life. He was 
one of the most faithful members of the Bap- 
tist church. He went to Wakefield, Massa- 
chusetts, in 1871, where he was in the same 
business several years. After he retired from

married, in 1713, Isabel Dyer, who was born 
at Truro, Massachusetts, in 1695. She was 
one of the sturdiest of Old Cape Cod (Massa- 
chusetts) families, and was a noble helpmeet 
for Samuel Small. Their children, all born 
at Truro, were: Samuel, 1714; Taylor, 1716; 
Francis, 1719; Mary, 1721; Isabel, 1724; Ly- 
dia, 1727, and Hix, 1729. 

(V) Taylor Small, born September 15, 1 716, 
at Truro, Massachusetts, died at Great Island 
(Great Sebascedegan), Harpswell. Maine. He 
was a man who inherited all the sturdy and 
noble characteristics of his Small and Dyer 
ancestors, and his life was a constant round 
of helpfulness for his family, neighbors and 
friends. He removed from Truro, Massachu- 
setts, to Harpswell, Maine, about 1750. He 
there purchased a fine old farm on a part of 
which some of his descendants still reside. He 
cleared away the sturdy forest trees with great 
energy, raised fine crops on every foot of land 
that he wrested from the wilderness, and be- 
came the owner of the finest lot of cattle on 
that part of the Maine coast. Not\ satisfied 
with all the hard work which was involved, he 
explored the eastern part of Casco Bay, and 
discovered some of the best "fishing grounds" 
off Harpswell and Cape Small Point. He was 
of great service in all things pertaining to the 
welfare of Harpswell, and was one of the most 
earnest patriots of this town famed far and 
wide for its patriotism. Two of his sons 
served in the revolutionary war. Taylor Small 
dwelt in the midst of one of the finest colonies 
of people that ^Massachusetts ever sent to the 
Maine coast. It comprised such family names 
as Otis, Raymond, Ridley, Snow, Purrington 
and Coombs. Among these Taylor Small 
stood as a man of the truest type of manhood 
and Christian zeal. While he had a great af- 
fection for his children, he ever helped them 
when the adventurous spirit of Francis Small 
was manifest in their words and deeds. All 
but one of these children moved from Harps- 
well, Maine, hewing out for themselves fine 
farms from the forest lands at Bowdoinham, 
Bowdoin, and other Maine towns. Taylor 
Small married, in 1742, at Truro, Massachu- 
setts, Thankful Ridley, who was born at Truro,

ley, of England. She was a woman of un- 
tiring energy, and a most faithful Christian.

Ridley, his wife, were: Deborah, Thankful, 
Tavlor, Joseph, David, Thomas, Samuel,

August, 1748," at Truro, Massachusetts, and 
died at Bowdoin, Maine, February 13, 1831, 
aged eighty-three years. He moved to Bow- 
doin at an early date, and entered most heart- 
ily into the pioneer work which was thus in- 
volved in his going to a place where wild 
beasts were many and the settlers were few. 
Before his death he had become the posses- 
sor of a farm that was the pride of people 
for miles aroimd. He was a man of very 
honest, upright character, and his descendants 
are famed for their skillful energy and trust- 
worthiness. Joseph Small married, March 29,

Several families of this name set- 
HYDE tied in Massachusetts in the first 

half of the seventeenth century. 
The one which claims as emigrant ancestors. 
Deacon Samuel Hyde and his brother, Jona- 
than Flyde, of Cambridge, has combined in 
an unusual manner family afifection and pub- 
lic spirit. In a single group of eight children, 
four daughters married their cousins of the 
same surname. Until comparatively recent 
times, the inhabitants of Newton were using 
for school grounds and playgrounds land 
given for that purpose by members of this 
family. 

(1) Jonathan Hyde was born in London, 
England, in 1626, and joined his elder brother 
Samuel at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1647. 
They bought of Judge Thomas Danforth, later 
president-of the district of Maine, forty acres 
of land in what is now Newton and subse- 
quently secured two hundred additional acres. 
This land was held in common until i66i. 
Five years before, Jonathan obtained eighty 
acres of the tract recovered by Cambridge 
from Dedham and increased his holdings in 
this locality to some three hundred and fifty 
acres. He bought and sold many lots in what 
was then known as Cambridge Village, and in 
some deeds he is entitled Sergeant Hyde. He 
was admitted to the Cambridge Church in 
1661, became a freeman of the colony in 1663. 
served as selectman of Newton in 1691 and 
possiblv in other years. Previous to his death, 
which 'occurred October 5, 1711, he settled 



88 



STATE OF MAINE. 



his own estate by deeds of gift to eleven of 
his children, thus conveying four hundred 
acres and several dwelling houses. His deed 
to his son Samuel makes the condition that 
the property should never be sold, or, if neces- 
sity forced a sale, it should be transferred to 
some one of his descendants. An interesting 
document, still extant, is the prenuptial agree- 
ment made with his second wife, and witnessed 
by the sister of John Eliot, the Apostle to 
the Indians, which provides for the disposal 
of property in case of the death of either. By 
his two marriages he had twenty-one children, 
of whom five died in infancy. His first wife 
was Mary, daughter of William Frencr., of 
Billerica, who died May 27, 1672, aged thirty- 
nine years. Her children were : Samuel,

daughter of Lieutenant William and Deliver- 
ance Hyde. His wife's father was a promi- 
nent man in the community and served in the 
expedition against Port Royal. She survived 
her husband, dying in 1795, aged eighty years. 
He died in 1768. They had twelve children, 
two of whom died in infancy; those that sur- 
vived were : Prudence, Hulda, Esther,-Martha,

of his long life, however, was spent at 
Winchendon, Massachusetts, where he died 
November 29, 1869. His wife, Elizabeth 
(Tolman) Hyde, whom he married Novem- 
ber 12, 1817, was the granddaughter of Aquilla 
and Waitstill (Leadbetter) Tolman, of Dor- 
chester, Massachusetts, and the daughter of 
Deacon Desire and Sarah (Howe) Tolman, 
of Winchendon, Massachusetts. She died Jan- 
uarv 3, 1866. Their children were: Sarah 
Tolman, Joel and Eliza Ann.

engaged in the manufacture of wooden imple- 
ments as a sub-contractor. He married (first)

ond) December 28, 1861, Catherine W. Dole, 
who survived him. He died March 3, 1866. 
His only children were Edward Francis, who 
died in infancy, and William DeWitt Hyde. 

(VII) William DeWitt, son of Joel and 
Eliza (DeWitt) Hyde, was born September 
23, 1858, at Winchendon, Massachusetts. He 
was prepared for college at Phillips Exeter 
Academy, graduated at Harvard in 1879, 
studied at Union Theological Seminary, New 
York City, and completed the course at An- 
dover Theological Seminary in 1882. After 
a year of postgraduate study of philosophy at 
Andover and Harvard, he was for two years 
pastor of the Congregational church at Pater- 
son, New Jersey. In June, 1885, he was 
chosen president of Bowdoin College, a posi- 
tion he has since occupied despite repeated 
invitations to larger institutions. Under his 
administration the students, the faculty and 
the endowment of the college have increased 
twofold, while his papers and addresses on 
educational subjects have won him a foremost 
place among the college presidents of the coun- 
try. A series of successful books in the de- 
partment of ethics and religion has not only 
established his reputation as a clear thinker 
and forceful writer, but extended his influence 
across the water. His "Practical Ethics" ap- 
peared in 1892, "Outlines of Social Theology" 
in 1895 ; "Practical Idealism" in 1897 ; "God's 
Education of Man" in 1899; "Jesus' Way" in 
1902; "From Epicurus to Christ" in 1904; 
"The College Man and the College Woman" 
in 1906; and "Abba, Father" and "Self-Meas-

As a preacher and public speaker he is widely 
sought and has given generously of his time 
and strength to the furtherance of many good 
causes. He was the organizer and for many 
years the president of the Maine inter-denomi- 
national commission, and a leader of religious 
thought in his ilenomination. He received the 
degree of D. U. from JJowdoin and from Har-

University in 1897. President Hyde married, 
in 1883, at W'ashingtonville, New York, Pru-

Associated with Gorges and 
COTTON Mason in the Laconia Com- 
pany, under whose auspices the 
first permanent settlements at Strawberry 
Bank and vicinity were made, were two Lon- 
don merchants, William aiul John Cotton, sons 
of Sir Allen Cotton, lord mayor of London 
in 1625 and 1626. These men did not join 
the company who emigrated to New England, 
and William died before 1634 when the part- 
nership interests of the two brothers were sold 
to Mason. The similarity of name would sug- 
gest that William Cotton, the immigrant, who 
appeared on Strawberry Bank, and on the 
last day of March, 1650, bought of Anthony 
Brockett his dwelling house and farm, was of 
this family. Another reasonable supposition 
is that \Mlliam. the immigrant, was connected 
with the family of Sampson Cotton, of Lon- 
don, whose daughter Elizabeth was the wife of 
Edmund Sheafe, whose descendants are nu- 
merous in Portsmouth. Leaving the English 
ancestors to be hereafter determined, we take 
up William, the immigrant, as we find him a 
property holder in Strawberry Bank, which 
was the early name of Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire. 

(I) William Cotton, the immigrant, after 
purchasing a dwelling house and farm situ- 
ated at Strawberry Bank next to the house of 
Walter Abbott, by the water side, March 31, 
1650, married Elizabeth, daughter of William 
and Honor Ham. The Hams came probably 
from Devonshire, England, to the coast of 
Maine and thence in 1636 to the Isle of Shoals 
and soon after to Strawberry Bank. William 
Cotton died in 1678. leaving six children to 



sliare his pniperly, his third son, Solomon, 
having died before his property was divided 
by probate order December 29, 1678. His 
widow survived him, but the date of her death 
is unknown. Children, bomi in Portsmouth, 
New Hampshire, as follows: i. John (q. v.). 
2. William, a tanner in Portsmouth, a mem- 
ber of the ])rovincial assembly and a man of 
wealth and iiitJuence. By his wife, Abigail, he 
had eight children : William, John, Eliza- 
beth, Joseph, .\bigail, Thomas, ,Mary and 
Sarah. 3. Solomon, a grantee with his brother 
William in a deed by William Ham, May 16, 
1671. He probably died before his father. 
4. Sarah, married Edward Beale, mariner of 
New Castle, and had four children : John, 
Sarah, Elizabeth and Martha Beale. 5. Thom- 
as. 6. Joseph, a minor in 1678. 7. Benja- 
min, a minor in 1678, a house carpenter in 
Portsmouth, who by his wife Elizabeth had 
four children : Sarah, Mary, Elizabeth and 
Deborah. He died in 1724 and his estate was 
administered by his four sons-in-law. 

(H) John, eldest child of William and 
Elizabeth (Ham) Cotton, was born probably 
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, about 1650. 
He was a farmer and his wife was Sarah, only 
child of William Hearle, or Earle, of Ports- 
mouth. William Hearle, or Earle, in his will, 
dated May 17, 1689, left his property to his 
son-in-law, John Cotton, and "his wifif my 
daughter Sarah," to go after their death to 
their oldest son, William Cotton. John Cot- 
ton, as the eldest son, received a double share 
in the distribution by probate order of his 
father's estate. He died in 1712, and his 
will, dated September 14, was proved Decem- 
ber 9 of that year. His widow's death is not 
recorded. The children of John and Sarah 
(Hearle or Earle) Cotton were twelve in 
number and all born in Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, as follows: i. William, a gun- 
smith, married, in Boston, November 6, 1699, 
Anne, daughter of Ralph and Susanna Car- 
ter and had one child, Sarah. 2. Solomon, 
a shipwright, lived in Kittery, Maine, and 
then in Portsmouth; married (first) Margaret 
Fernald, of Kittery, and (second) Judith Cutt,

Elizabeth, John, Sarah, Joseph, Benjamin and 
Solomon. 3. John, a butcher in Portsmouth, 
married, May 6, 1714, Elizabeth Davis and 
had five children: John, about 1715; William, 
Elizabeth, Timothy and Mary; he died in 1723, 
and his widow, Elizabeth, probably married, 
August 16, 1725, John Gilder, of Kitterv. 4.

Thompson before August 8, 1707. 6. Mary,

(HI) Thomas, fourth son and child of John 
and Sarah (Hearle or Earle) Cotton, was 
born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where 
he was a joiner and carpenter and carried on 
the same business after he removed to 
Gloucester, Massachusetts, upon his marriage, 
July 28, 1718, to Comfort, daughter of John 
and Ruth (Wheeler) Riggs^ of Gloucester. 
His wife was born May 3, 1698. After 1722 
he made his home in Greenland, New Hamp- 
shire, and he made his will there January 2. 
1768, and it was proved September 17, 1770,

(Vni) John Bradbury, son of Benjamin 
Robinson and Abby J. (Pike) Cotton, was 
born in Woodstock, Connecticut, August 3, 
1841, died January 5, 1909. He received his 
name as a compliment to his father's friend, 
John C(5tton Bradbury, who was cashier of 
the York Bank in Saco for many years. He 
attended school in Clinton, Massachusetts, and 
Lewiston, Alainc, preparing for college at the 
Lewiston Falls Academy, Auburn, Maine, and 
was enabled to take his college course through 
the kindness and liberality of his father's 
friend, John Cotton Bradbury, who always 
manifested a special interest in his namesake, 
prophesying for him a brilliant career and 
whose own life was a succession of good 
deeds. While at college he studied law in the 
office of Fessenden & Frye, of Lewiston, both 
Thomas A. D. Fessenden and William P. 
Frye being his instructors. He was gradu- 
ated at Bowdoin, A. B., 1865, A. M., 1868, 
and on leaving college went into the law office 
of Fessenden & Frye as clerk, and the next 
June was admitted to the Maine bar in 1867 
and to the bar of the United States supreme 
court in 1899. On the death of Mr. Fessen- 
den in 1868, he was made junior partner in 
the newdy formed firm of Frye & Cotton, and 
later, when Mr. White was admitted as jun- 
ior partner, the firm became Frye, Cotton & 
White. In June, 1889, the firm was dissolved, 
and Mr. Cotton accepted the position of assist- 
ant attorney-general of the L'nited States by 
appointment of President Harrison, made in 
May, 1889, and his position gave him charge 
of the interests of the United States govern- 
ment in the court of claims at Washington. 
While practicing law^ in Lewiston, he was at- 
torney for most of the manufacturing cor- 
porations of that city and vicinity and of the 
Maine Central Railroad Company. He retired 
from the attorney-general's office in June, 
1893. to engage in the general practice of 
law in Washington, District of Columbia. His 
long residence in the National capital made

him a familiar personage in government circles 
and at the Cosmos Club, of which he was 
early made a member, and at the University 
Club, where he met many of his fellows of the 
Kappa Chapter of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity 
of Bowdoin College, and he was also a mem- 
ber of the Maine Society of Washington. In 
the Masonic fraternity he became a Knight 
Templar and a Scottish Rite Mason. While a 
citizen of Lewiston, he served one term on the 
board of the common council of the city and 
as a member of the Lewiston school board. 
He was a member and attendant, with his 
family, of the Congregational church. Mr. 
Cotton married, December 5, 1866, Amanda 
Gorham, born March 10, 1842, daughter of 
Mark Lowell, of Lewiston, Maine, and their 
only child, Ethel Bradbury, was born at Lew- 
iston, Maine, March 24, 1877, and married, 
October, 1899, F. Willard Carlisle, a banker of 
New York City. Their daughter, Marjorie 
Cotton Carlisle, was born in Washington, 
March 5, 1904, being of the tenth generation 
from William Cotton, the immigrant, Ports 
mouth. New Hampshire, 1650. Mr. and Mrs. 
John Bradbury Cotton have their home at 
1355 Euclid street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 

The head of all the Win- 
WINCHESTER chesters in America is 
claimed by good genealo- 
-gists to have been John, who came to Hing- 
ham, Massachusetts, in 1635, then nineteen 
years old, in the ship "Elizabeth," from Lon- 
don, William Stagg, master. John had one 
and one-half acres granted to him in 1665, 
and twelve acres in the same year. In 1637 
the freeman's oath was administered to him, 
and he removed to Muddy River (now Brook- 
line, Massachusetts) in 1650. His children 
were : John, Josiah and Mary. He died in 
1694, his will being dated in 1691. 

(I) Josiah, son of John Winchester, was 
born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and had 
David and nine other children. 

(V) Daniel Winchester, born in Fayette, 
Kennebec county, Maine, March, 1768, was 
probablv a great-grandscn of Josiah. He 
married Martha, daughter of John and Lucy 
(Wood) Pritchard, and had Benjamin P. He 
was drowned in the Androscoggin, in 1795. 

(VI) Rev. Benjamin P., third son of Daniel 
and Martha (Pritchard) Winchester, was born 
in Fayette, Maine, January 17, 1793. He was 
three years old when his father was drowned, 
and was adopted by Captain Benjamin Palmer. 
He received a rudimentary education in the 
country schools, and came to Corinna in 1816. 



Mr. Winchester joined the Free Baptist 
Church, and was settled over the Baptist church 
in Corinna, remaining in that connection for 
thirty-seven years, a remarkably long pastor- 
ate. In addition to his ministerial duties, he 
taught school, and followed that fundamental 
industry, farming. Elder Winchester was an 
ardent patriot, and sent two of his sons to the 
South in the troublesome times of the sixties. 
He was an active temperance worker, and 
engaged in all good causes tending to the re- 
formation and betterment of mankind. He 
was a Whig, and because of the cloth was not 
averse to participating in public affairs, and 
considered it the duty of every citizen to bear 
his part of the burdens of local government. 
He served as selectman for eight years, town 
clerk fourteen years, also as town treasurer, 
and was a faithful public servant. He mar- 
ried Eliza Knowles, born in Fayette, Maine, 
in 1794. Children: Harriet, Mary Ann, Mar- 
tha, John, Benjamin, Sarah, Oren and Betsy. 
This good man, kind neighbor, true patriot, 
and capable official, servant of the Lord, who 
wrought in various ways and succeeded in 
them all, was called to his reward above, No- 
vember 26, 1865, just as the war in which he 
had taken so much interest had terminated. 
Mrs. Winchester lived to mourn his loss four 
years, succumbing to mortal illness in 1869. 

(VII) John, eldest son of Rev. Benjamin 
P. and Eliza (Knowles) Winchester, was born 
in Corinna, JMaine, January 25, 1822, and died 
September 27, 1891. The country school af- 
forded him his early training, and he took up 
farming as a livelihood. He was a Republican 
in politics, a member of the Grange, of the 
Baptist church, and of the Independent Order 
of Good Templars. He married Elizabeth M. 
Stewart, of Corinna, May 14, 1844, and their 
children were : Mary, married Gilman W. 
Hilliker, of New York; Charles; Olive M., 
married George F. Thurston, of Corinna ; John 
Howard. Mr. W^inchester enlisted in the 
Fourth jNIaine Battery in the civil war, and 
then contracted disease for which he drew a 
liberal pension. 

(Vni) John Howard, third son of John 
and Elizabeth (Stewart) Winchester, was 
born in Corinna, April 14, 1845. The schools 
of his native town, Corinna Union Academy 
and the Maine Central Institute of Pittsfield, 
was the academical route he followed. He 
taught school for a time, afterward engaged 
in the meat business, and subsequently became 
station agent and telegraph operator at Cor- 
inna. Since 1898 he has been librarian of 
Corinna Library, president of the Maine State 



STATIC OF MAIM':.

Library Association, and is at present president 
of the Eastern Maine Library Club. He is 
well posted on library matters, and interested 
in books and good literature. Mr. Winchester 
votes with the Republicans, and is one of the 
local leaders in his town, and has been a mem- 
ber of the school board. He is noble grand 
of Stone Eagle Lodge, No. 139, Independent 
Order of Otid Fellows, and has been a mem- 
ber of Twilight Grange for thirty years. Mr. 
Winchester is one of the bright, stirring men 
of Corinna and has the elements that go to 
the making of a substantial citizen. 

Mr. W'inchester married Sadie B., daugh- 
ter of Daniel B. and Phehe A. (Brown) Dole, 
of Exeter. .Maine, in 1886. Their children; 
Sidney Hodge, born July 17, 1887, a grad- 
uate of Corinna Lmion Academy, now a stu- 
dent at the Cniversity of Maine; Jeanette, 
born April 15, 1888, a graduate of Corinna 
L'nion Academy, and now a student at Colby 
College. 

Elizabeth M. (Stewart) Winchester, wife 
of the late John Winchester, and mother of 
John Howard Winchester, of Corinna, Maine, 
is supposed to be a descendant of that family 
of Stewards that consisted of the brothers who 
came over from Scotland at an early date. 
The proof of this is lacking, but this branch 
of the Stewards, or Stewarts, trace to Dun- 
can Steward, of Ipswich, Massachusetts, who 
settled there in 1658. He joined the church 
in Rowley, September 26, 1723; his wife Anne 
joined September 17, 1721. Both Duncan and 
Anne Steward lived to be nearly one hundred 
years old ; they made their home in Newbury, 
Massachusetts, where Duncan was a ship- 
builder; in 1680 they were living in Rowley.

STATE OF MAINE. 



(Bates) Stewart, was born in Bloomfield, 
Maine. He was fairly well educated, and in 
addition to farming was a Baptist minister, 
possessing more than ordinary ability as a 
preacher. He was a man of broad mind, and 
was chosen to serve his town for several years 
as school committeeman and also as selectman. 
He was an earnest temperance worker and al- 
ways first in every movement along that line. 
He organized debating clubs for men and boys, 
and in fact was always interested and fore- 
most in any movement tending to improve the 
morals and enlarge the minds of young 
people. He and his wife were school teachers 
in their younger days, and were always deepi\- 
interested in the education of the youth of 
their vicinity. Although a man of moderate 
means, he gave his children a liberal educa- 
tion. He married, December 19, 1822, Eliza 
Merrick of Pittsfield, Maine. They settled in 
Corinna, Maine, where their children were 
born. Eliza (Merrick) Stewart died in Cor- 
inna, March 29, 1873. David Stewart mar- 
ried a second time. He died in Corinna, April 

6, 1884. Children of David and Eliza (IMer- 
rick) Stewart: i. David Dinsmore, born Oc- 
tober 22, 1823 ; studied law, and is considered 
one of the ablest lawyers in the state; he 
married .\riminta 2\Ierrick, and resides in St. 
Albans. 2. Elizabeth Merrick, born January 

7, 1825, married, i\iay 14, 1844, John Win- 
chester (see Winchester VH). 3. Levi Mer- 
rick, born December 10, 1827, mentioned be- 
low. 4. Charles Miller, born April 24, 1829, 
was educated in the academy at Corinna and at 
Corinth, and was prepared to enter college, 
but having an opportunity to go to Australia 
with some friends at a good salary, he ac- 
cepted ; the climate, however, was too un- 
healthy for his constitution and he died after 
a four months' residence. He possessed more 
than ordinary natural ability and every pros- 
pect was bright for his future. He and his 
descendants have used the Stewart form of the 
family name. 

( Vn) Levi Merrick, son of David and Eliza 
(Merrick) Stewart, was born in Corinna, 
Maine, December 10, 1827. He was graduated 
from Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and 
later from Harvard Law School. In 1856, 
through the influence of a former resident of 
Corinna, Dr. Jacob Elliot, of Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, he was persuaded to go to that 
city. There he engaged in the practice of law 
very successfully. In connection with his law 
business he engaged in land speculation, i)ur- 
chasing large tracts, which with the rapi I 
growth of that wonderful city soon became 



very valuable. In 1895 he began the erection 
of a town hall and public library building 
in Corinna, which was completed at a cost of 
seventy-two thousand dollars, and was pre- 
sented to the town in memory of the first set- 
tlers there, among whom were his own par- 
ents. The building was dedicated and pre- 
sented to the town September i, i8g8, and is 
known as the Stewart Library Building. The 
site is an ideal one, on an eminence in the 
center of the town. The building, which is 
one any city might be proud of, is two stories 
high, of brick and stone, with tower equipped 
with clock and bell to strike the hours. The 
first floor, finished in fine oak, comprises li- 
brary, reading rooms and offices, and the sec- 
ond floor is a hall with seating capacity for 
seven hundred people. The library, also the 
gift of Mr. Stewart, contains 4.800 choice vol- 
umes. He also presented the city of Minne- 
apolis with the lot which their Public Library 
stands on, and gave largely to deserving in- 
stitutions in a very quiet way. Among his in- 
timate friends Mr. Stewart is known as "El- 
der Steward." He has no religious preferences 
and is not a member of anv societies and clubs. 



The surname Cleaves, Cleves, 
CLEAVES Cleve, Cleeves and Clive, vari- 

ouslv spelled, is derived from 
local names. Parishes of this name are found 
in the counties of Gloucester, Somerset and 
Worcester. The Cleve coat-of-arms is : A 
wolf's head erased per pale dancette art sable. 
The family bearing this armorial has its seat in 
Walford, county Salop. Another ancient ar- 
morial of the family is : Argent an escarbuncle 
sable. The following is used by the family 
at Huxley, Chester, who descend from the 
Clives of Syche : Argent on a fesse between 
three wolves' heads erased sable as many mul- 
lets or. Crest : A griffin passant with wings 
endorsed ducally gorged or. The London 
family has the same device. A coat-of-arms 
in general use, perhaps the original of the 
above : Argent on a fesse between three foxes 
heads erased sable, as many mullets or. Crest : 
A fox's head erased sable. 

(I) George Cleeves, the first of the name 
in this country, was born in England about 
1576, and came from Plymouth in Devonshire 
in 1630 and settled first at Spur wink, or Scar- 
borough, Maine. .A.fter two years he moved 
farther eastward and is said to have been the 
first settler at Falmouth, now the city of Port- 
land, drawn thither, it is said, by the mag- 
nificent harbor. He served on the grand jury 
in 1640. He united with Richard Tucker, of

Saco, both in trade and land speculation, 
"thereby promoting great discord among 
patentees." Cleeves and Tucker took a lease 
of fifteen hundred acres of land, including Hog 
Island in Casco Bay, from Sir Fcrdiuando 
Gorges, the patentee of Maine, January i-, 
1636. They conveyed Hog Island by lease 
to Alexander Rigby, May 23, 1643. George 
Cleeves granted to Edward Rigby a thousand 
acres near Casco Bay. Cleeves sold a lot at 
Black Point, September 30, 1648, to Henry 
Watts: one hundred acres to Nicholas Bart- 
lett, on Falmouth Neck, adjoining land of 
Cleeves and his son-in-law, Michael Brilton : 
to Michael Milton a tract fronting Casco river 
from Mitton's dwelling house to land of Rich- 
ard Tucker, Falmouth Neck, on Back Cove, 
May I, 1658; to Nathaniel Mitton fifty acres 
on Back Cove, May 20, 1658; to John Bush 
four hundred acres at Cape Porpoise, May 14, 
1661 ; to Hope .\llen four hundred acres at 
Falmouth; to Michael Britton a tract at Casco 
Bay, February 24, 1650; to Thomas Kimball, 
Hog Island, in Casco Bay, May 15, 1658; 
grants to various neighbors to establish bounds 
April 12, 1664. Cleeves was admitted a free- 
man in 1658; was deputy to the general court 
in 1663. He died in 1667, probably very old, 
as his wife Joan, who died in 1663, was eighty- 
seven. (See histories of Willis and Folsom, 
Winthrop i.. p. 237, ii., p. 256; Sullivan, 312- 
16.) Cleeves had a daughter Elizabeth, who 

married Michael Mitton, and (second) 

Harvey, and died in 1681, and probably other 
children. The family probably left Maine at 
the time of King Philip's war. 

(II) William Cleaves, ancestor of all of the 
old families of the name in New England, was 
born about 1650. It is not likely that he was 
the son of George, unless we have estimated 
his age too great or the birth of William at 
too late a date. But he owned property in 
York county, Maine, and it seems impossible 
that he could have been unrelated to George 
Cleeves, the first settler. On June 12, 1688, 
William was one of the grantees of a tract 
six miles by four, called Cokshall, adjoining 
Wells and Cape Porpoise, Maine, from Har- 
laakanden Symonds, of Ipswich. This terri- 
tory is now the town of Lyman, Maine. We 
find his son Robert in Arundel (Kennebunk- 
port), where he bought land of James Smith, 
November 11, 1732. But William Cleaves 
made his home in Beverly, Massachusetts, 
where his descendants have lived to the pres- 
ent time. He married (first) Martha Corey, 
and (second) her sister Margaret. They were 
daughters of Giles Corey, who met the most 



cruel death of any of the innocent victims of 
the Rev. Cotton Mather and his fellow per- 
secutors during the witchcraft delusion. Corey 
was a man of excellent character, a watchman 
by occupation, born in England about 1617, 
according to his own deposition June 17, 1672. 

Corey married (first) Margaret , who 

was the mother of his children; (second) 
Mary , 'Svho was bought out of a Lon- 
don ship in Virginia by the father of Caleb 
More, who testified to this and to her good 
character when she was accused in 1678" (of 
witchcraft). She died August 27, 1684. (See 
gravestone at Salem.) Corey was tortured to 
death after being found guilty by the court at 
Salem. Stones were piled upon him until he 
was slowly crushed to death by the weight. 
Even Nero devised no more cruel death for 
his innocent victims. .All the Cleaves family 
are descendants of this martyr. Children of 
Giles and Margaret Corey : Martha, Mar- 
garet ; Deliverance, born August 5, 1658. 
Margaret (Corey) Cleaves married (second) 
May 3, 1716, Jonathan Byles. Children of

(Ill) Lieutenant Benjamin, son of William 
Cleaves, was born in Beverly, October 23, 
1693, and died there September 14, 1775. He 
was a prominent citizen, and lieutenant of the 
military company. He married, June 2, 1719, 
at Beverly, Rebecca Conant, born March 29, 
1696, died September 13, 1770, daughter of 
John and Bethia (Mansfield) Conant. Her 
father was born December 15, 1652, at Bev- 
erly, inherited a lot given his father in 1666 
by his grandfather. Governor Roger Conant, 
and followed farming; was a soldier in Cap- 
tain Samuel Appleton's company in King 
Philip's war ; deacon of First Church of Bev- 
erly, August 23. 1691 ; died September 30,

in 1657; selectman in 1662; was given the 
homestead and other land of his father at Bev- 
erly, leased back to his parents for the nominal 
rental of a kernel of corn yearly during their 
lives ; his wife Elizabeth was daughter of Rev. 
William Walton, graduate of Emanuel Col- 
lege in 1621, receiving his A. M. in 1625 and 
having Seaton parish in Devonshire before 
coming to America, settled at Hingham, Wey- 
mouth and Alarblehead, where he was minis- 
ter. Roger Conant, son of Richard and Ag- 
nes, father of Lot Conant, mentioned above, 
was baptized at Budleigh, England, April 9, 
1592, came to Plymouth about 1622, and re- 
moved soon to Nantasket ; was recommended 
by friends in England to the Western Ad- 
venturers as a successor to Mr. Thomas Gard- 
ner at the Cape Ann Colony, and took charge 
there in 1625. On the failure of the colony 
at the end of a year, he with others removed 
to Naumkeag, later called Salem. Conant is 
conceded by many to be the first governor of 
Massachusetts Bay, followed by Winthrop, 
who brought more settlers to Naumkeag, 
which Conant virtually founded. He was ad- 
mitted freeman May 18, 1631 ; was town offi- 
cer, deputy to the general court ; his son I^oger 
was the first child born in Salem.

Caleb Dodge's company, on the Lexington 
alarm. He was drafted by Captain Woodbury, 
notwithstanding the fact that he was fifty- 
three years old, for three months in Colonel 
Henry Herrick's regiment, and asked to be 
excused on the ground that he already had a 
son and apprentice in the army and had con- 
tributed money to the support of the Conti- 
nental army. He was released from service 
by the council August 22, 1777, but later was

director in many of the banking and financial 
institutions of the state. He actively practiced 
law for a period of more than thirty years, and 
obtained prominence in the profession he 
loved. Memorial exercises were held by the 
Cumberland Bar Association before the Su- 
preme Judicial Court, and the following ap- 
propriate resolution was adopted and placed on 
the records of the Court : 

"Resolved, That the members of the Cum- 
berland Bar have heard with a deep sense of 
personal grief and loss the news of the sud- 
den illness and death of their distinguished 
associate member, Hon. Nathan Cleaves, at 
the very summit of his professional career ; 
that his contemporaries at the Bar during their 
lives will cherish the memory of his unvarying 
courtesy, his dignity of professional bearing 
and demeanor, his pure life and character, his 
eminent legal attainments, his fine training and 
capacity in all matters pertaining to his pro- 
fession, his exceptionally good forensic judg-

ment, tact and skill and the rare and excellent 
traits and qualities of his mind and heart ; 
and, cherishuig this memory of him ourselves, 
we write also this brief memorial of him, that 
they who come after us in the profession, to a 
late posterity, may remember him as one of 
the models and ornaments of his own times." 

(VII) Thomas Perley, third son of Thomas 
and Sophia (Bradstreet) Cleaves, was born in 
Bridgton, January 7, 1838. He was educated 
in the common and high schools of liridgton 
and vicinity, and at (jxford Normal Institute, 
South Paris, Maine. Adopting the law as his 
profession, he entered the office of Hon. Ed- 
ward Fox and Frederick Fox, of Portland, 
and was admitted to the bar in 1859. He 
opened an office in Brownfield, Maine, and 
early took high rank in his profession. He has 
held many positions of public trust. In 1862 
Mr. Cleaves was elected assistant secretary of 
the senate of Maine, and re-elected in 1863-64. 
In 1865 he was elected secretary of that body 
and continued in office by successive elections 
for five years. He was elected senator from 
Oxford county, serving two terms. Recogniz- 
ing his ability and high standing, Hon. Lot M. 
Morrill, senator from Maine, selected him as 
chief clerk of the appropriation committee of 
the United States senate; and Mr. Cleaves and 
his family removed to Washington. Through 
all the successive changes in the senate of the 
United States, he has continued to serve in 
this responsible position for nearly thirty-six 
years, and has been closely associated with 
the late Senator Allison, of Iowa, Senator 
Hale, of Maine, and other distinguished sen- 
ators who have served on this important com- 
mittee. He married Elizabeth A., daughter of 
Russell Lamson, of Bridgton. They have two 
sons : Charles Russell Cleaves and Frederick 
Henry Cleaves. 

(VII) Henry Bradstreet, fourth and young- 
est son of Thomas and Sophia (Bradstreet) 
Cleaves, was born in Bridgton, February 6, 
1840. He attended the public schools, and the 
North Bridgton and Lewiston Falls academies. 
He enlisted from the town of Bridgton as a 
private soldier in the civil war, served in the 
Department of the Gulf under General Banks, 
was with General Sheridan in the Shenandoah 
Valley, and remained in active service under 
General Grant until the surrender of General 
Lee. During his service he was promoted to 
first lieutenant, and at the close of the war 
was offered a commission in the regular army 
by Secretary of War Stanton. He was admit- 
ted to the bar in 1868, practiced in Bath one 
year, then removed to Portland, forming a law 



partnership with his brother, the late Judge 
Nathan Cleaves. He served two terms as a 
member of the legislature of Maine; was 
elected city solicitor of Portland; served as 
attorney-general of Maine for five successive 
years; and was elected governor of Maine in 
1892, and re-elected by nearly forty thousand 
majority in 1894. At the close of his adminis- 
tration as governor, both branches of the legis- 
lature, irrespective of party, accorded to him 
the imusual distinction of passing public reso- 
lutions in recognition of his distinguished ser- 
vices to the state, and commenduig his "'up- 
right, honest and dignified administration," 
further declaring "He retires from i.ie higii 
office he has so ably and faithfully filled, witii 
the confidence, respect and aitection of the 
whole people." L'pon retiring from the office 
of governor he resumed the practice of his 
profession at P^ortland. He was at once re- 
tained as counsel by many of the leading busi- 
ness interests of the state, and tried before the 
courts many important cases, being general 
counsel for the Maine Central Railroad Com- 
pany, the Washington County and the Somer- 
set Railways, associate counsel of the Boston 
& Maine Railroad and attorney for various 
other business and financial interests. The 
most notable case ever tried in the state, and 
one that excited much interest throughout the 
country, was the Chandler will case, in which 
Governor Cleaves appeared as senior counsel 
for the heirs. The American Board of Com- 
missioners for Foreign Missions, under a will 
executed by the testator, claimed the entire 
estate, nearly a million dollars, while it was 
claimed in behalf of the heirs that they were 
entitled to one-half of the estate by a subse- 
quent codicil of the testator, though it was 
executed while he was under guardianship. 
The contention of Governor Cleaves was sus- 
tained by the supreme court of Maine, and the 
validit)' of the codicil upheld. 

Governor Cleaves is intimately con lected 
with many of the great business interests of 
the state, being a director of the IMaine Cen- 
tral Railroad Company, Somerset Railway 
Company, L'nion Mutual Life Insurance Com- 
pany, Portland National Bank, Union Safe De- 
posit & Trust Company, Consolidated Elec- 
tric Light Company, president and director of 
the Portland Publishing Company, Eastern 
Dredging Company and Leadville Water Com- 
pany, and associated with other financial and 
business institutions.

Thomas and Sophia (Bradstreet) Cleaves, was 
born in Bridgton, and enjoyed the superior

character, of engaging manner and endears

The line of Bradstreet 
BRADSTREET sketched below is de- 
scended from one of the 
earliest recorded settlers of this name in New 
England, his landfall being in 1634. An 
earlier immigrant of this name was Simon, 
who came over in the fleet with Winthrop, 
1630, and afterward won distinction as Gov- 
ernor of Massachusetts Bay Colony. From 
those two are descended most of the New 
England Bradstreets. 

(I) Humphrey Bradstreet came from Ips- 
wich, England, in the ship "Elizabeth," Wil- 
liam Andrews, master, the last of April, 1634, 
bringing with him his wife Bridget and chil- 
dren as follows : Hannah, aged nine ; John, 
aged three ; Alartha, aged two ; and Mary, aged 
one year. At that time his age is given as 
forty years, and that of his wife as thirty 
years. He settled in Ipswich, Massachusetts, 
where he received a considerable grant of land 
on the north side of Egypt river, his being the 
most northerly grant made by the town of 
Ipswich ; the northerly boundary of this farm 
was the southerly boundary of the town of 
Rowley, settled in 1639, and in 1784 the farm 
for the convenience of its occupants was set 
off from Ipswich to Rowley. From the loca- 
tion of this farm, after the Rowdey settlement, 
the Bradstreets were associated almost wholly 
with Rowley, having their membership in the 
Rowley church, burying their dead in the 
Rowley cemetery, and training with the Row- 
ley military company. In the following lists 
of children, where not otherwise stated, the 
births are from Ipswich records and the bap- 
tism from the Rowley church record. Hum- 
phrey Bradstreet was made a freeman May 6, 
1635, and was a representative for Ipswich to 
the general court in the same year ; he died in 



the summer of 1655. lii^ will, dated July 21, 
1655, proved September 25, 1655, directs, 
among other things, that son Moses is to have 
the home farm after the decease of his mother;

ber, 1665. iler will is dated October 16, 1665.

From the original set- 
LITTLEFIELD tlement of York county, 

Maine, up to the present 
time (A. D. 1908), the Littlefield family have 
resided there, and many of the name have 
figured prominently both in public affairs and 
in developing its agricultural and industrial 
interests. A sturdy, energetic people, the pa- 
rent stock was inclined to favor free thought in 
matters pertaining to religion, and were 
staunch supporters of the theological doctrine 
advocated and practiced by Rev. John Wheel- 
right. 

(I) Edmund Littlefield, born in Southamp- 
ton, England, about 1600, married Annis 

. (The records give no family name.) 

He came to this country from Tichfield, Eng- 
lantl, probably at the same time as the Rev. 



Jnlni W'heclriglit, for he was one of his parish- 
ioners at Exeter in 1630, and was one of the 
combination to whom twenty-one acres of land 
was assigned. In 1638 he sent to England for 
his family, and on May 16 of that year his 
wife Annis and si.x children took passage for 
Boston in the "Bevis" of Hampton, Captain 
Townes. The Rev. John Wheelright, owing 
to a religious controversy precipitated by the 
teachings of Anne Hutchinson, left Exeter 
and later went to Wells, Maine, many of his 
parishioners going with him, and among them 
Edmund Littlefield, who in 1641, leaving Ex- 
eter, went to Wells, Maine, where he was one 
of the first settlers. He was supposed to have 
built the first house, a saw mill and grist mill. 
He was deeded a lot of land by -Sir Ferdinand 
Gorges in 1643, ^"<i was a leading spirit in 
organizing the town and promoting its de- 
velopment. He was on the grand jury in 1645, 
and it is said was the richest man in Wells. 
Lie and his sons were millmen and farmers. 
He was of fearless enterprise and sound moral 
principle. On account of this firm, moral 
character, he was appointed by the governor 
of iVlassachusetts agent for the sale of liquors 
in Wells, it being then of the utmost im- 
portance that great discretion should be used 
in the distribution to the Indians. He was 
one of the committee to settle the boundary be- 
tween Wells and Cape Porpoise, and was 
elected by the people for the years 1654, 1655, 
1658, 1660 and 1661 to try small cases. He 
died in December, 1661. Children: Francis, 
born 1619; Anthony, Elizabeth, John, Thomas, 
Mary, Hannah, Francis Jr., born 163 1. 

(II) Francis, eldest son of Edmund Little- 
field, born in i6ig, for some cause for which 
no explanation is given, disappeared from his 
father's home about the age of six. and was 
supposed to have died. Francis Jr. was born 
about six years later, and the parents named 
this child Francis. In the meantime Francis 
the elder had come to Exeter previous to 1639, 
and from Exeter went to Woburn, where he 
married. His wife died December 20, 1646, 
leaving a daughter who died later, this being 
about five years after his father went to Wells. 
Soon after his daughter's death, Francis left 
Woburn and went to Wells also, only to find 
his father and family already located there. 
Francis Littlefield Jr. married Meribah Ward- 
well. Children: Joseph, born about 1652; 
Nathan, Jonathan, Job, David, Mary J., Jo- 
anna, Tabitha, Hannah. 

(III) Joseph, eldest child of Francis Little- 
field, married Jane Cole, daughter of Nicholas 
Cole, but died before July, 1698, when the

widow married John Heard. Cliildren : Jo- 
seph, Meribah. Priscilla, perhaps other chil- 
dren. Joseph wa;^ half owner of the falls 
at Kennebunki which had been granted by the 
town of Wells and Kennebunk. 

(IV) Joseph (2), eldest child of Joseph ( i ) 
Littlefield, married Abigail Storer, daughter of 
Joseph and Hannah Storer, August 4, 1709. 
Children: Benjamin; probably other children. 

(V) Benjamin, son of Joseph (2) Little- 
field, married Dorcas Black, daughter of Sam- 
uel and Dorcas Black, of York, December 11, 
1753. Child: Samuel Black. Benjamin Lit- 
tlefield was one of the substantial men of the 
town. His parents were familiar with the ex- 
periences of the settlers in the times of the 
Indian wars, and he was taught the necessity 
of courage to meet the events of life and in- 
dustry in its ordinary pursuits. Like others 
born in that day of hardship, he had put few- 
opportunities for education, but he so im- 
proved those he had and acquired so much of 
the rudiments of knowledge that in 1760 he 
was chosen the clerk of the proprietors of the 
township, and held that office forty-three 
years. He spent his life in milling and farm- 
ing. He was the owner of the grist-mill near 
his house and had an interest in the saw-mill 
in which he found employment. He was a 
man of very correct habits. In 1776 and 1777 
he was one of the selectmen of the town. He 
died October 5, 1821, at the age of ninety-one, 
leaving children and grandchildren (one of 
whom was Christopher), who have main- 
tained an honorable standing in society. 

(VI) Samuel Black, son of Benjamin Lit- 
tlefield, married Susannah Hatch, daughter of 
Joshua and Susannah Hatch, December 9, 
1802. He was one of the most prominent 
residents of Wells, and a deacon of the Con- 
gregational church. He was twice married. 
Children, by first wife : one son. Christopher, 
born in Wells, September 15, 1803. By sec- 
ond wife: Trustam, Jonathan G., Samuel B., 
Susan, Sarah, Mary, Jane. 

(VII) Christopher, son of Samuel Black 
Littlefield, born in Wells, Maine, September 
15, 1803; married Sarah Gooch. daughter of 
John and Olive Gooch, October 17. 1826. 
Children : Charles Rollins, born September 
12, 1828; Abigail, Susan H., Sarah G., Annie 
W., John G. Christopher Littlefield was the 
only child of Samuel Black Littlefield by his 
first marriage. His education was begun in the 
public schools, continued under the preceptor- 
ship of a private tutor, and he concluded his 
studies at the Hampton, New Hampshire, 
Academy, where he was prepared for educa- 



tional pursuits. For many years he was en- 
gaged in teaching, and acquired a high repu- 
tation. As town clerk of Wells, in which ca- 
pacity he served for many years, he displayed 
marked ability, as well as a profound interest 
in the public affairs of the community, and as 
representative to the state legislature from 
Wells he evinced a like solicitude for the gen- 
eral welfare of the town. He was cashier of 
the C)cean National Bank at Kennebunk from 
its organization, August i, 18.S4, to December 

1, 1888, when he resigned after thirty-four 
years of continuous service. The original 
deed of land to Edmund Littlefield, signed by 
Sir Ferdinand Gorges, was in the possession 
of Christopher Littlefield up to the time the 
bank building in Kennebunk was destroyed by 
fire, when it was burned. Only that day it 
had been returnei! from the Maine Historical

(IX) Arthur Stevens, fifth son of William 
Hobbs and Mary (Stevens) Littlefield, was 
born at Vinalhaven, Knox county, Maine, 
.April 10, 1864. He was educated at the pub- 
lic schools of his native town, Nichols Latin 
School and Bates College, from which institu- 
tion he was graduated in 1887, and from Co- 



lumbia law School, New York City, 1889. He 
was admitted to the bar in December, 1889, 
and at once commenced ])ractice at Rockland, 
Maine, where he has built uj) a large and 
lucrative law business, ranking probably the 
first in the county. His offices in a finely ap- 
pointed suite of rooms are attractive and com- 
modious. In politics Mr. Littlefield is a Re- 
publican, re]iresenting his district in the state 
legislature 1903-1905, and is a member of the 
city council and the school board. He is also 
a director in the Security Trust Company of 
Rockland. Mr. Littlefield is a Mason and 
master of Aurora Lodge, No. 50, F. and A. 
M.: member of King Solomon Temple, No. 
8, Royal Arch Chapter; King Hiram Coun- 
cil, No. 6, Royal and Select Masters; and the 
Clarcmont Commandery of Rockland. He is 
also a member of the Consistory of S. P. and 
R. S. of Portland, and Kora Temple, Mystic 
Shrine, of Lewiston. On March 23, 1907. he 
was elected without a dissenting vote, e.xalted 
ruler of Rockland Lodge, No. 1008, B. P. O. 
E., which fact testified to his popularity and 
fitness for oftice. Mr. Littlefield married, at 
Lewiston, January 29, 1890, Rosa A., daugh- 
ter of F. P. and Rosalba A. Weymouth, who 
was born in Lewiston, January 29, 1864. They 
have no children. 



Mason has been a distinguished 
MASON name in New England from the 

early settlement of the country, 
and no generation since then has been without 
leading citizens of this cognomen. The fam- 
ilv herein treated is one of the ancient fam- 
ilies of York county, Maine, whose early his- 
tory is enveloped in the dim and shadowy town 
and family records of Hollis. where the name 
has existed from the early days of pioneer set- 
tlement. 

(I) Amos Mason was a farmer of Hollis. 
He married there Betsey Plaisted; children: 
Eliza Jane, died at age of twenty-three; Han- 
nah Morse; Sarah G., married Mr. Palmer; 
Jeremiah M., of whom further; Josiah, Lo- 
renzo; Benjamin; Dorcas Jane, died young; 
Catherine, died younc. 

(II) Hon. Jeremiah Miller Mason, son of 
Amos and Betsey (Plaisted) Mason, was horn 
in Hollis, Maine, March 20, 1820. and died in 
Limerick, March 26, 1897. By force of cir- 
cumstances he was denied the privileges of 
education in his youth, and in order to shift 
for himself soon became an apprentice and 
learned the tailor's trade. With characteris- 
tic energy he thoroughly mastered his trade 
and in earlv manhood moved to Limerick and

engaged in business, and by close application 
and indomitable courage not only acquired a 
good elementary and business education, but 
became possessed of a wonderfully clear judi- 
cial knowledge which later served him well in 
his active career. He soon won recognition 
throughout the northern tier of towns in York 
county, as a carefully energetic, honorable and 
successful man of business. For many years 
he conducted a general store in the town of 
his adoption, which, by means of his rare busi- 
ness sagacity and spirit of fair dealing, he 
made a center of trade throughout the Ossi- 
pee Valley. He was a pioneer in the manu- 
facture of ready-made clothing when that im- 
portant branch of industry was introduced ; 
and during the civil war he gave employment 
to a large number of skilled operatives, in this 
way advancing the growth and prosperity of 
the" flourishing borough with which he had 
identified his fortunes. In 1879, when the vil- 
lage of Limerick was swept by a great fire, 
Mr. Mason's store was destroyed ; but, not 
one whit dismayed, he at once rebuilt it, on 
the old site, and continued to do business as 
before. This store was conducted by him un- 
til about the year 1888, when he disposed of it 
in order to devote his entire time and atten- 
tion to other interests in which he was ac- 
tively engaged. 

Flaving made for himself an enviable repu- 
tation for business ability, strict integrity, in- 
domitable perseverance, and conservatism in 
the conduct of affairs, Mr. Mason was chosen 
to fill the responsible position of president of 
the Limerick National I'ank, the duties of 
which office he discharged up to the day of his 
death, to the entire satisfaction of the stock- 
holders and the business public, and with 
credit to himself. He also served in the ca- 
pacity of director of the Westbrook Trust 
Company, and as a member of the board of 
directors of the Portland National Bank. In 
addition to these engagements he was inter- 
ested in the real estate business, and purchased 
as investments many tracts of state lands in the 
wooded section of northern Maine, and on 
the islands along the coast. In all enterprises 
which he undertook, Mr. Mason acted up to 
the strict letter of his engagements, expecting 
the same treatment in return from all those 
with whom he had dealings. 

In politics Mr. Mason was originally a 
Whig, but on the break-up of that party in 
1856 he became a Democrat. When the civil 
war began he was classed as a "War Demo- 
crat." but he soon came to entertain the belief 



that the only substantial hope for a restoration 
of the Union lay in the triumph of the Repub- 
lican, or, as it was at that time termed, the 
"L'nion" party. Believing thus, he acted 
promptl}-, as was his wont, and threw in his 
lot with the organization which recognized 
Abraham Lincoln as its leader, and he felt it 
to be his imperative duty to take an active and 
aggressive part in politics. So thoroughly 
were his unselfish motives appreciated by his 
fellow citizens, and so unhesitatingly was his 
fitness for public service recog^iized by them, 
that political preferment came his way without 
solicitation on his part, and indeed sometimes 
against his personal inclinations. It was felt 
by his political associates that his name would 
be a tower of strength on the party ticket, and 
conduce greatly to its success. 

Mr. Mason first served the town of Limer- 
ick as its representative in the state legislature, 
and in the years 1866 and 1867 represented the 
county of York in the same body. So well 
and so faithfully did he serve his town and 
shire that he was selected for a seat in the 
executive council, and held this position for 
four consecutive years — the first term in 1874, 
being during Governor Dingley's administra- 
tion,' and the others in 1875, 1876 and 1877, 
during the three years' incumbency of Govt 
ernor Connor. While he was a member of the 
governor's council Mr. ]\[ason's habit of close 
attention to financial detail rendered him a 
most valuable man at the council board, and in 
the discharge of his duties as auditor of ac- 
counts he saved the great sum of $200,000 to 
the state by his careful scrutiny of every bill 
which was presented for payment. Nor did 
Mr. Mason neglect the town's interests while 
engaged in state affairs ; he was chairman of 
the board of selectmen of Limerick in 1868, 
and again in the years 1876 and 1877. For 
many years he was a trusted political leader 
in the county of York, and was looked up to 
for counsel and advice. The compass of his 
acquaintance was wide, and he numbered 
among his friends and associates many men 
who stood high in political life and financial 
circles. By them his views were eagerly 
sought, and his opinions about all important 
matters pertaining to his section of the country 
had great weight. His advice, so often sought, 
was given with circumspection and with con- 
scientious regard for the welfare of the seek- 
ers, and with a careful consideration of the 
attendant circumstances and the weighty prob- 
. lems involved. By his uprightness, his frank- 
ness, his probity and his loyalty to his friends.

he clasped his associates lu by hooks of steel ; 
and they held not only in high esteem, but in 
genuine affection as well. 

Mr. Mason married, August 10, 1849, Mar- 
tha Weeks, born in Buxton, February 10, 1824, 
died March 23, 1891, in Limerick, daughter 
of William and Eliza (Burnhani) Woodman, 
of Buxton (see Woodman). .A. friend once 
wrote of her: "She was a woman of whom 
it may be truly said, "Her price is far above 
rubies.' XatuVally of a clear and discrimi- 
nating mind, kindly disposition and refined 
taste, all the surroundings of her early years 
tended to cherish and develop those traits, and 
made her what she was, a true wife and 
mother. Living in circumstances where every 
desire of her heart of a worldly nature could 
be gratified, her sensitive and retiring nature 
shrank from everything that had the appear- 
ance of display, or could attract observation. 
Her home was the center of her cares and af- 
fections, and by her loving ministrations and 
ready tact she made it a true haven of peace 
and rest. Here her husband, laying aside the 
cares and perplexities of a busy life could al- 
ways come, sure of hearty greetings, sympathy 
and cheer ; and her children feel that here was 
one heart that beat only for their comfort and 
highest welfare." 

Children of Mr. and Mrs. Mason: i. Wil- 
liam W., of whom further. 2. Mattie B., who 
resides at the Mason homestead in Limerick, 
was educated in the public schools and Limer- 
ick Academy of her native town. .She is a 
lady of quiet tastes and womanly attainments, 
combining a thorough knowledge of the house- 
hold science with clear business insight, en- 
abling her to serve efficiently as an active di- 
rector of the Limerick National Bank while 
managing her own estate and ' maintaining a 
home of refinement and culture. 3. Frances 
E., married Charles G. Moulton (see Moul- 
ton) ; one child, Olga Frances. 

(HI) William Woodman, only son of Jere- 
miah Miller and Martha Weeks (Woodman) 
RTason, was born in Limerick, August 25, 
1830. He was educated in the common schools, 
at Limerick .-Xcademy, and Eastman's Business 
College, Poughkeepsie, New York. After com- 
pleting his studies he devoted himself to the 
extensive lines of business which his father 
was then managing, becoming his assistant, 
and acquired a thorough knowledge of 
both business and finance. Subsequently 
he accepted the cashiership of the Lim- 
erick National Bank, of which his father was 
president, and served in that capacity for many 
years. In 1889 he became vice-president of the 



Portland National Bank, and in 1907 was ad- 
vanced to the i)residency of that institution. Be- 
ginning at the very boitom round of llie ladder, 
he has advanced steadily upwaru, step by step, 
until he is now occupying a position of promi- 
nence ; and through his entire career he has 
ever been looked upon as a man of integrity 
and honor, never making an engagement that 
he has not fulfilled, and standing as an exam- 
ple of what determination and force, com- 
bined with the highest degree of business 
acumen, can accomplish for a man of natural 
ability and strength of character. Inheriting 
in a marked degree the fine characteristics of 
his father, strict integrity, straightforward 
dealing, generosity and independence, he has 
proven himself most successful in carrying out 
the policies so sagaciously projected by the 
father whose example he emulates and whose 
memory he both cherishes and honors. 

William Woodman Mason is in full sympa- 
thy witli all the great movements of the world 
about him, and watches the progress of events 
with the keenest interest. He is a generous 
friend, and a warm advocate, of all those who 
are battling for the right, and for principles 
and policies for the public good, and he has 
a pleasing personality which has won for him 
a legion of friends. Like his father, he is an 
earnest Republican, and exercises an influ- 
ence in the councils of his party. He has held 
but one official position, that of representative 
in the legislature, to which place he was 
elected in 1885 from the classed towns of 
Limerick and W'aterloo, serving one term most 
efficiently and creditably. He is a charter 
member of Highland Lodge, No. 48, and a 
member of Fraternity Encampment, No. 32, 
Independent Order of Odd Fellows. 

Mr. Mason married, in Portland, May, 1891, 
Mary, daughter of Thomas and Sophia (Brad- 
street) Cleaves (see Cleaves family). 



This pioneer family, mem- 
WOODMAN bers of which are traced in 
the following account, has 
the distinction of being descended from the 
first Woodman who landed on New England 
soil and became the progenitor of a line which 
now exists. The family name probably came 
from the occupation of him who first took it. 
(I) Edward Woodman, probabl)' from Cor- 
shan, a village in Wiltshire, England, eleven 
miles from Christian Malford, came with his 
wife Joanna, and together with Archelaus 
Woodman, probably his young brother, set- 
tled in Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1635. 
Archelaus came from England in the ship

"James" ; the name of the ship which brought 
Edward is unknown. Edward Woodman was 
one of the ninety-one grantees who settled 
Newbury, and one of fifteen of tliat tumiber 
who was entitled to be called ""Mr." He is 
supposed to have lived in 1681, and for years 
before, in what was afterward and for a long 
time known as "Woodman's Lane," now 
known as Kent street, and situate in the pres- 
ent town of Newburyport. Jilarch 25, 1681, 
Edward conveyed to his son Jonathan "My 
now dwelling-house, houses and barns and or- 
chard and pasture, and all my plow land lying 
by and adjoining to the said houses, as also all 
the plow lands upon the northwest side of the 
street lying upon the westward side of my 
house, the said street being vulgarly called the 
Newstreet." The consideration for this con- 
veyance was "natural and fatherly love and 
alTection" and "twenty pounds which is yearly 
to be paid during the time of my own and my 
wife's natural life. " Edward Woodman is 
not known to have had any trade. In a deed 
<:lated 1687 he is styled husbaniman. He was 
a man of influence, decision, and energy, and 
opposed with great zeal the attempt made by 
the Rev. Thomas Parker to change the mode 
of church government from Congregationalism 
to something like Presbyterianism. He was 
made a freeman May 25, 1636; was a deputy 
in the general court in 1636-37-39-43 ; in 1638- 
41-45-46 was one of the three commissioners 
to end small causes in Newbury, and at vari- 
rous times held other offices of trust in town 
and state. He was one of the first selectmen 
of Newbury, elected in 1636, and his name 
heads the list as given by Coffin. Among his 
.other commissions he had one from the state 
"to see people marry," of which in 1681 he 
speaks as follows : "An unprofitable commis- 
sion ; I quickly laid aside the worke, wdiich 
has cost me many a bottle of sacke and liquor, 
where friends and acquaintances have been 
concerned." He and his wdfe Joanna were liv- 
ing in February, 1688. She was then seventy- 
four. He died prior to 1694, at an unknown 
age. Their children were : Edward, John, 
Joshua, Mary, Sarah, Jonathan and Ruth. Ed- 
ward and John were born in England. 

(II) Joshua, third son and child of Ed- 
ward and Joanna Woodman, was born in Old 
Newbury, in 1636; "first man child borne in 
Newbury" is the legend his gravestone bears. 
He took the oath of allegiance in 1678, and is 
then called forty-one. It appears that he lived 
in both Andover and Newbury. He owned 
land in Haverhill, where he built a house be- 
tween 1660 and 1668, and probably resided. 



After he was sixty years old (169S), he 
bought twelve acres of land of Benjamin Lowe 
in the tract called the freehold lots, in the up- 
per woods, which was bounded "northerly by 
the highway upon the Merrimack river." By 
his will he devised his land in Haverhill to 
three of his sons ; this included one hundred 
and twenty acres of the two hundred and 
twenty acres which his father Edward bought 
of Stephen Kent, November 21, 1662, and is 
said to constitute a part of the site of the 
present city of Lawrence. His will was made 
March 27, 1703, O. S., and probated July 12, 
of the same year. He died May 30, 1703, 
aged seventy-seven years, doubtless in Byfield 
parish, and was buried in the graveyard ad- 
joining the parish meeting house lot, on the 
line between Newbury and Rowley. His grave 
and that of his son Joshua are still marked 
by the (original) small slate stones set there 
years ago. He married, January 23, 1666, 
Elizabeth Stevens, who died in 1714, daughter 
of Captain John and Elizabeth Stevens, of 
Andover. Children : Elizabeth, Dorothy, 
Joshua, Jonathan, a son (died young) Me- 
hetable, David, Benjamin, Sarah and Mary. 

(Ill) Benjamin, eighth child and fifth son 
of Joshua and Elizabeth (Stevens) Woodman, 
was born probably in Andover, Massachu- 
setts, July 27, 1683. By deed dated December 
6, 1706, he bought, being then of Newbury, 
for twenty-two pounds, of John Dummer, of 
Newbury, seven and one-half acres of land 
lying in Newbury, and there it is believed that 
he settled and raised his family and resided 
until his death. There is tradition to confirm 
the other evidence that this was his home, and 
it is known that he lived in Byfield parish in 
Newbury. He was a tanner, and the place has 
been the site of a tanyard time out of mind. 
He bought, March 26, 1735, a one hundred 
and twenty-third part of the town of Narra- 
gansett, No. i (Buxton). May 31, 1736, he 
bought one-half of an original right ; and Sep- 
tember 29, 1745, he bought the other half of 
that original right ; and the same year he was 
one of the two who agreed to build each a 
house and clear four acres of land in that 
township within four years. These interests 
in the town he conveyed to his son Joshua, 
December 24, 1741, and April 15, 1747. He 
died in 1748. His will was made April 14, 
1748, and probated July 4 follow-ing. He mar- 
ried, March i, 171 1. Elizabeth Longfellow, 
born July 3, 1688, at Newbury Falls, daughter 
of William and Anne (Sewall) Longfellow. 
"William Longfellow, the only One of the name 
who came to America, was born in 165 1, in

others, lie married Anne, sister of Jud^c 
Samuel Sewall, and daushtef of OKI Henry 
Scwall. William Longfellow was very im- 
provident, and loved a frolic rather too well. 
He was what would be called, at the present 
day, a high buck. He enlisted as ensign in the 
ill-fated expedition to Canada, and was 
drowned at Anticosti in October, 1690, when 
his daughter Elizabeth was a little over two 
years old." Children of Benjamin and Rliza- 
l)eth : Ann, Sarah, Jose])h, IJenjaniin, Joshua, 
David and Jonathan (twins), Nathan and 
Stephen. 

(IV) Captain Joseph, third child and eldest 
son of Benjamin and Elizabeth (Longfellow) 
Woodman, was born in Newbury, May 31, 
1715. baptized Jinic 5, 1715, and died in Hol- 
lis, Maine, July 4, 1796, and was buried on his 
own farm in Buxton. He seems to have been 
a settler in Narragansett No. i (Buxton, 
Maine), as early as May 26, 1742, when his 
name is found on a petition by the then eleven 
settlers of the town. On account of the war 
between England and France in 1744, this set- 
tlement then broke up, and all the settlers left. 
There is no record of any settlers in the town 
between this date and 1750. June 10, 1746, 
Joseph Woodman was the grantee in a deed 
wherein he is described as "of Biddiford, la- 
borer." This deed conveyed title to him of one- 
eighth of a double sawmill standing on Jor- 
dan's creek, and on the west side of Saco river, 
and known as the upper mill. February 9, 
1747, Joseph W'oodman and two others, yeo- 
men, were grantees "of one-quarter part of a 
sawmill standing on Saco river in the town of 
Biddeford, and on that part of said river 
known as Cole's spout." "Also one quarter 
part of a sawmill near adjoining to the former 
higher up upon the said river, on a place 
known by the name of Jordan's crick ; also one 
quarter part of eleven acres of land situated in 
Biddeford aforesaid and adjoining unto the 
said two sawmills." These eleven acres of 
land are now covered by the factories and a 
considerable portion of the city of Biddeford. 
Joseph W'oodman returned to Narragansett 
No. I in 1750, and resided at Pleasant Point; 
his farm comprising lots 10 and 11 in range B, 
of the first division, and his house occupying 
the highest part of lot 11. In 1754 the pro- 
prietors" fort or garrison was built on lot 11, 
close by his house. He sold this place in 1757, 
and from that time forward the proprietors' 
records show that he was one of the most 



active and prominent men in the town, and 
the registry of deeds show.s that he was at dif- 
ferent times the owner (jf nuich real estate. 
As early as 1750 he built a sawmill, the first 
of the kind in the town. He was captain of 
the first military com)>any ever mustered in 
Buxton. His daughter .^ally stated, in 1755, 
of her father: "He was a great lumberman in 
those days ; he used to haul lumber to Pleas- 
ant Point and raft it to Saco. He sold his 
place to Cadwallader Gray, moved to the Hol- 
lis side of Salmon Falls, and built the first 
dwelling house there, and lived only three 
years afterwards." HoUis was then the "Plan- 
tation of Little Falls." Joseph Woodman mar- 
ried, in 1737, Betsey Durell, or more probably, 
Betsey Sewall. She died before she was 
twenty-one years old. Joseph W^oodmaij mar- 
ried, according to the town records of Read- 
ing, Massachusetts, November 7, 1739, Cath- 
arine Smith, of Reading, born June 20, 1721, 
daughter of Isaac and ^lary Smith. He mar- 
ried for his second or third wife, widow Cole, 
probably born Tarbox. He married last Reli- 
ance Edgcomb, widow of James Edgcomb, 
born Thompson, a native of Brunswick. His 
children were : Betsey, probably child of Bet- 
sey Sewall : i\Iary, Olive, Joseph, Rebecca, 
James, Susanna, Nathaniel and Sally. Seven 
children were born by the second (third) wife : 
and one of the last wife. 

(V) Captain Joseph (2), fourth child and 
eldest son of Joseph (i) Woodman, was born 
in Biddeford, date of birth unknown, probably 
1749; and died October 15, 1824, in the sev- 
enty-sixth year of his life. Buxton was a 
forest when he was born and during his boy- 
hood. He was for three months the pupil of 
Silas Moody, and this was all the schooling 
he ever had. He settled on lot 3, range A, 
second division, probably immediately after his 
marriage, and there he made his home as long 
as he lived. He built his first house in Au- 
gust, 1775, while the British were cannonading 
Portland, and when he heard the thunder of 
their batteries at Buxton, wished he could 
have the glass they were breaking there to 
glaze the windows of his new house, which 
for want of g'lazing he was obliged to board 
up. The country was then so near its natural 
condition that wolves were plenty, and howded 
about his house at night. In 1802 he built a 
much more pretentious house, with a hip roof, 
which is still standing. He built the first saw- 
mill on the Buxton side of the Saco river, 
and his cousin, Hon. John Woodman, and 
others built the first one on the Hollis side. 
He owned the land where the dam and mill 



112 



STATE OF MAINE. 



stood, and is said to have felled the first tree in 
clearing the ground for his improvementh. He 
built not only the first sawmill, which was 
double, but three single sawmills on the Bux- 
ton side at Bar Mills. Before 1798 he also 
built a grist mill and a fulling mill there. A 
carding mill was put into the fulling mill at 
a later day, and is said to have been the first 
one in Maine. A large portion of the lumber 
in his day went to the West Indies, and re- 
turn cargoes were composed mainly of rum 
and molasses. Then every one drank rum 
not excepting the women and the clergy ; and 
Captain Woodman, being largely engaged in 
lumbering, not only drank it, but bought it by 
the hogshead for the use of his workmen and 
of his friends. He was the founder of the 
Bar Mills on the Buxton side of the river. 
He owned most if not all of the land where the 
mills and most compact part of the village 
now stand, and his farm lay adjacent. He 
never ceased to have a lively interest in all that 
related to Bar Mills, and though an old man 
when the building of the first bridge there 
was undertaken, he was so much interested in 
the project that he waded into the water to 
help move and place the crib which was to 
serve as a foundation for one of the piers of 
the bridge. While thus engaged he bruised 
one of his legs ; inflammation ensued, and death 
was the consequence. He was an energetic, 
wide-awake man, of great natural abilities, 
who knew as much law as any lawyer of his 
day, it was said, and to him all the people 
of the neighborhood went for counsel and ad- 
vice. In politics he was a Jeffersonian Demo- 
crat, and capable of maintaining his side in a 
very spirited debate with his opponents in the 
Federalist party. He joined no church, but 
was the first in town to adopt the faith of 
the Universalists. He had a remarkably fine 
voice, and attended Parson Coffin's church, 
where for many years he sang in the choir. 
He had great muscular strength, was fond of 
wrestling or any rough game which would 
test his strength and prove him master. He is 
said to have been a great joker and fond of 
convivial entertainment. He was a handsome 
man, handsomely dressed in the fashion of the 
time, wearing queue, ruffles, and so forth ; in 
form, noble, erect and commanding, and hav- 
ing manners of the old school, dignified and 
polished. He was captain of the military com- 
pany, and was thereafter always called Cap- 
tain Woodman, a title which his father bore 
before him. A military captaincy in those 
days was an honored position, which he was 
proud to hold. When in command of his com- 



pany he dressed elegantly, wearing short 
clothes with silk stockings, silver knee and 
shoe buckles, ruffled shirt and ruffled wrist- 
bands. He was a Free Mason, and his funeral, 
which was the "largest ever seen in the town 
up to that time, was under the auspices of 
that body. There were about eighty carriages 
in the procession. He was noted for courage 
and perseverance, and carried through what- 
ever he undertook. He was generally liked, 
and was benevolent and good to the poor. He 
married, March, 1773, Abigail Woodsum, 
doubtless born in Biddeford, where she was 
baptized May 28, 1755, and died at the house 
of William Scribner, who married her grand- 
daughter, Abigail Wingate, December 26, 
1838, aged eighty-three years and eight 
months. She was the daughter of Michael 
and Elizabeth (Dyer) Woodsum, of Bidde- 
ford, who were married August 24, 1749. 
Her father's father was probably Joseph 
Woodsum, of Berwick, tailor. Her father 
moved to Narragansett No. i when she was a 
small child, and she was taken there on a 
load of hay. She was a tall, stately woman, 
with black eyes and dark complexion, and per- 
fectly erect, even in her old age. She was of 
grave demeanor, quiet, and not given to gos- 
sip. She performed faithfully and well the 
duties which were incumbent upon her, and 
commanded the respect and esteem of all who 
knew her. It has been written: "Her chil- 
dren were justly proud of her as of their 
father, and I never saw more admiration ex- 
pressed and more reverence manifested by 
children towards their parents than I witnessed 
in grandmother's children towards her. She 
would have commanded respect in any com- 
pany." Children of Joseph and Abigail 
(Woodsum) Woodman, all born in Buxton: 
Edmund, Joseph (died young), Mary, Eliza- 
beth, Joseph, Abigail, William, Submit, Tam- 
son, John, James and Hannah. 

(\'I) William, seventh child of Joseph (2) 
and Abigail (Woodsum) Woodman, was born 
December 17, 1787, and died at Bar Mills, 
January i, 1833. He was a lumberman, and 
resided at Bar Mills. He was considered a 
reliable and honorable man, and was beloved 
for his manly and social qualities. He was 
genial, social, fond of society and amusements, 
of quick and sympathetic feelings, and had 
a merry laugh which made all those who heard 
it laugh also. All regretted his early death. 
He married, July, 1815, Eliza, daughter of 
Aaron Burnham. of Scarborough. She died 
July 30, 1877. They had six children, all born 
in Buxton : Sarah Moody, Abigail Harris,

members of the Newbury church in 1674. He 
subscribed to the oath of fidelity in 1678. His

1824. He married, in 1777. Hannah (Pierce) 



Eaton, born 1751, died in August, 1850, at 
the age of ninety-nine years. They were the

(VI) Benjamin, eldest son of Moses and 
Hannah (Pierce) (Eaton) Woodman, was 
born in 1783, probably in Danville, New 
Hampshire, and went to Lovell, Maine, whence 
he removed to Sweden, Maine. His active 
years were devoted to agriculture, and he 
maintained an intelligent interest in all that 
pertained to the public welfare, being an active 
Methodist in religion and a Whig in politics. 
He married Rachel Eaton ; children : Timothy, 
John, Abigail, Hannah, Nathan and Mary. 

(\'II) John, second .son of Benjamin aui] 
Rachel (Eaton) Woodman, was born 1808, in 
Dover, New Hampshire, and removed with his 
parents to Fryeburg, Maine. When seventeen 
years of age he went to Fryeburg, Maine, but 
soon after settled in Sweden, same state, where 
most of his life was passed, engaged in farm- 
ing and lumbering. Lie was an active mem- 
ber of the Methodist Episcopal church, in 
which he held various official stations, and 
was a Whig and among the early supporters 
of the Republican party. He was a captain 
of militia and prominent in all public affairs. 
He died about i8go, at the age of eighty-two

age of seventeen he enlisted under General 
W^ashington and served through the war. At 
the age of ninety years he went from Frye- 
burg. Maine, to attend a soldiers' reunion in 
Boston, and died soon after. John and Sarah 
A. (Evans) Woodman were the parents of 
five children : The eldest, Sarah Worth, be- 
came the wife of Marcus Nash, and both are 
now deceased. Rebecca married Simeon 
Charles, of Fryeburg. John Francis is men- 
tioned at length below. Caroline Evans mar-

largely a self-educated man. having prepared 
himself by private study, after which he took

a course in preparation for the Methodist min- 
istry. Meantime he worked at blacksmithing. 
He was made a deacon and subsequently be- 
came a member of the Maine Conference, May 
9, 1875. He has served as pastor at Shap- 
leigh, Acton, New Vineyard, New Portland, 
Phillips and Strong. Because of failure of 
his health he was compelled to abandon the 
ministry, and located on a farm in Oxford, 
Maine, where he has since resided and is a 
man of affairs in the community. A Republi- 
can in politics, he has filled various junior 
offices, and is affiliated with the Independent 
Order of Odd Fellows. He married, March 
28, 1859, at Raymond, Maine, Sarah Small 
Nash, daughter of Daniel S. and Aclisah A. 
(Small) Nash. Daniel S. Nash was a farmer 
resitling in Raymond, and had four children ; 
Marcus, Sarah S., Samuel and Mary. Sarah 
S. (Nash) Woodman died before 1875, and 
Mr. Woodman married (second) January 9, 
1875, Dorothy Melissa Abbott, youngest child 
of Tobias anci Dorothy (Wilson) Abbott. To- 
bias Abbott was a farmer residing in Newfield. 
There were three children of Mr. Woodman's 
tirsl marriage : Daniel Nash, again mentioned 
below ; John, died aged tw^o years ; and Sarah 
Ann, wife of William H. Merchant, residing 
in Yarmouth, Maine. The children of the 
second marriage were : Alice Alay, Frank 
Evans and Ethel Hoyt. 

(IX) Daniel Nash, -eldest son of Rev. John 
F. and Sarah S. (Nash) Woodman, was born 
March 31, 1861, in Sweden, Maine, and there 
passed his boyhood, but attended Kent's Hill 
Seminary for three years and graduated at the 
Eastern Maine Seminary with class of 1899. 
He was subsequently a student for two years 
in the medical department of Bowdoin Col- 
lege, and studied medicine two years at the 
medical school connected with the Maine Gen- 
eral Hospital at Portland. After one year at 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 
Baltimore, he was graduated in April, 1893. 
He immediately began the practice of his pro- 
fession at North Yarmouth, where he re- 
mained four years, and has ever since been 
established at Yarmouthville, where he has a 
large and growing practice and is highly es- 
teemed as a man and citizen. Dr. Woodman 
is a member of the American Medical Asso- 
ciation, of the Maine Medical Society, and of 
the Academy of Medicine and Science, at Port- 
land. He is affiliated with the Masonic fra- 
ternity, having obtained the Royal Arch de- 
gree, and is also a member of the Improved 
Order of Redmen, and the Knights of the 
Golden Eagle ; and of the Methodist Episco- 



pal church. He was once active in political 
matters, associating with the Republican party, 
but in recent years has given little attention to 
matters of that nature. He married, October 
II, 1890, Hattie Worthley Kendell, born in 
1871, in Bangor, Maine, daughter of Alva 
and Harriett (Worthley) Kendall. Their chil- 
dren are : Lewis A., Edward Francis, Alfred 
King, Ruth Nash, Sarah Melissa, Arthur T., 
Ethel Maud and Alice Cynthia. 



(For early generations see Edward Woodman I.) 

(IV) Joshua (2), third son 
W0C)D:\IAN of Benjamin and Elizabeth 

(Longfellow) Woodman, 
was born in Newbury, Massachusetts, Jan- 
uary 22, 1720. Together with his brothers 
Joseph and Nathan he settled near Pleasant 
Point, in Buxton, Maine, in 1750. On De- 
cember 24, 1741, his father conveyed to him 
one full right of land, being one one-hundred 
and twenty-third part of Narragansett No. i 
(now Buxton), and by subsequent purchase 
he acquired title to si.x and one-half full 
rights, or about one-seventeenth part of the 
entire township. It is said that he also owned 
still other lands than those mentioned. Ac- 
cording to Dennett's map ( 1870) he settled 
and had his home on lot No. 22, range C, first 
division. Under date of Biddeford, August 21, 
1749, the clerk of the proprietors of Narragan- 
sett No. I was requested to call a meeting on 
the application of Robert Brooks, John Brooks, 
Jacob Davis, John Redlon, Thomas Bradbury, 
Joseph Woodman, Joshua Woodman and 
Amos Chase. At that time all of these men 
were doubtless living in Biddeford and Saco, 
all of which territory then was under the name 
of Biddeford. The year 1749 seems to have 
been one of preparation on the part of the 
proprietors of the town, and from the follow- 
ing year (1750) dates the permanent settle- 
ment and continuous history of the town. In 
1742 a temporary settlement was made and 
was continued for two years, when the pion- 
eers were compelled to abandon their lands on 
account of the outbreak of war between Eng- 
land and France, which of course involved 
their American colonies. Joseph Woodman 
was one of that small band of intrepid pion- 
eers who in 1742 made the first attempt to 
found the town which was compelled to be 
abandoned two years later, but his brother 
Joshua is not known to have been one of them. 
Joshua evidently moved from Newbury to 
Biddeford some time during the year 1749, 
at the time when the proprietors were making 
preparations for the second attempt at perma-

Tlic iiroprietors' records show that Joshua 
Woodman was one of the loading men in the 
new region, frequently moderator of the town 
meetings and his name appears often among 
the petitioners to the ])roprietors for various 
purposes and also among those who had occa- 
sion to present petitions to the general court 
of the province ; and the records hear testi- 
mony to the fact that he was chosen to serve 
on committees to which were delegated im- 
portant and responsihle duties. In fact his- 
tory establishes that Joseph and Joshua Wood- 
man were recognized as leaders among the 
founders of the town, (hi June 27, 1765, 
probably on account of financial embarrass- 
ments Joshua Woodman conveyed to his 
brother Stephen (then of Falmouth, now 
Portland) "my homestead farm whereon I 
now dwell, containing one hundred acres, 
more or less, the same Ijeing six home lots in 
said townsliip, viz. : In Letter C the home lots 
numbered 21, 23 and 26, and in Letter D 
lots numbered six and seven, together with 
the buildings thereon standing." This appears 
to have been the beginning of a series of finan- 
cial reverses which eventually resulted in the 
loss of a considerable part of his once large 
land holdings in the town. Several judgments 
were obtained against Joshua Woodman at 
the June term of the court in York county in 
1767 and several others at the June term of 
the court in the following year. The causes 
of his misfortunes are not known. He died 
in Buxton about the year 1800, and his wife 
is said to have died six years afterward. Both 
were buried in the graveyard at the Lower 
Corner, and Cyrus Woodman, in his work 
entitled "The Woodmans of Buxton, Maine" 
(1872), says that the stones marking their 
graves are still standing. 

(V) Joshua, son of Joshua Woodman, mar- 
ried June 14, 1787, Sarah Wheeler, of Bux- 
ton, and died January 16 (or 21), 1844. He 
served in the American navy during the revo- 
lutionary \var, was captured by the British, 
and confined in what was called the Mill 
prison in England ; but after a time he man- 
aged to escape by digging under the prison 
wall. He also was in the land service during 
a part of the war, and was with the army 
under General W'ashington throughout the 
eventful winter at Valley Forge, at which place 
it also is said that he was one of W'ashing- 
ton's life guards. Captain Robert Wentwortli, 
of Buxton, is our authority for the statement 
"that with others he dug under the walls of 
the Mill prison in England and escaped to 



France." He remainid in the latter country 
for some time, without money or means of 
any kind by the use of which he was able to 
return to America. However, one of his fel- 
low townsmen, a Captain Harding, who hap- 
pened to be in England about that time and 
heard of his misfortune, went to France and 
provided him with the means to get back home. 
His gravestone says that Joshua W'oodman 
died Jamiary 16, 1844, aged ninety-five years, 
which doubtless is an error, if his brother Ben- 
jamin was older than himself, for their father 
was not married until May 25, 1749. 

(VI) Samuel, son of Joshua and Sarah 
(Wheeler) W'oodman, was born in Buxton, 
Maine. August 28, 1790, and died in Portland, 
Maine, about 1827. He married (fir.st) June 
5, 1815, Paulina Libby, of Corham, Maine, 
and (second) in 1821, Lydia Raymond. 

(VII) Benjamin J., only son of Samuel and 
Paulina (Libb\-) Woodman, was born in 
W^estbrook, Maine, November 20, 1818, and 
died there in 1903. He was a shoemaker by 
trade, and in the earlier part of his business 
life was associated with \\'illiam H. Neal, of 
Westbrook, in the manufacture of shoes. This 
was before the days of modern shoe factories. 
The firm of Neal & W'oodman, as the partner- 
ship was known, manufactured shoes largely 
by hand and distributed the product of the 
shop through the surrounding towns with 
wagons. It was the custom of the "shoe team" 
to call at the merchant's door and supply their 
wants from stock carried in the wagon driven 
bv the salesman. The firm carried on a profit- 
able business for many years and became large 
holders of real estate in the town, but finally 
was compelled to suspend operations during 
the panic and business depression of 1857. At 
that time Mr. Woodman disposed of his in- 
terest in the concern to his partner and re- 
moved to a farm in Westbrook. where he died, 
in his eighty-fifth year. He married, in De- 
cember, 1840, Charlotte Babb, of W^estbrook, 
and both she and her husband were members 
of the W'estbrook Methodist Episcopal Church 
for more than half a century ; children : 
Charles B., Paulina H., Benjamin F., Clara, 
Mary and Charlotte. 

(Vni) Charles Babb. eldest son of Benja- 
min J. and Charlotte (Babb) Woodman, was 
born in W'estbrook, Maine, in 1841, and died 
in that city in August, igoi. He received his 
education in the common schools of his native 
town and in Gorham Academy, and for the 
next ten years after leaving school was em- 
ployed in the steward's department of different 
coast steamboats, three years of that period

being spent on government transports during 
the civil war. He enlisted early in the war, 
but was not able to pass the required physical 
examination. At the close of the war he re- 
turned home, and in company with E. H. 
Sturgis entered general merchandizing, the 
finn name being Sturgis & Woodman. In 1872 
he purchased his partner's interest in the busi- 
ness, and soon afterward gradually sold out 
his grocery stock and confined himself to the 
sale of drugs and medicines. For a number 
of years he was proprietor of the only drug 
store in Westbrook. and he continued in that 
business until the time of his death. Mr. 
Woodman always took an active and com- 
mendable part in public affairs. Before West- 
brook became a city he was for many years a 
member of the Republican town committee and 
its chairman for thirteen years. For several 
years also he was a member of the Republican 
district committee of the state, having been 
selected for that position by the late Thomas 
B. Reed. For five consecutive years he was 
town clerk and treasurer of Westbrook, and in 
1885 and again in 1887 represented Westbrook 
in the lower house of the state legislature. 
After the town became a city he was twice 
elected member of the board of aldermen, 
serving as president of the board during his 
second term of office. He was postmaster of 
Westbrook four years during the administra- 
tion of President Harrison, and in April. 1899, 
was reappointed by Mr. McKinley for another 
term. He died during the second term of his 
incumbency of office, and as an appreciation of 
his faithful performance of duty his youngest 
son, Benjamin J. Woodman, was appointed his 
successor; and the son is now postmaster of 
the city. In 1863 Charles Babb ^^'oodman 
married Clydemena Spears, of Waterville, 
Maine, and by her had six children : Charles 
Harold, now dead ; Alice Louise, now dead ; 
Guy Perley. a business man of Brunswick, 
Maine; George M., a physician of Westbrook; 
Benjamin J., postmaster of Westbrook; Philip 
Everett, now dead. 

(IX) George M., third son of Charles Babb 
and Clydemena (Spears) Woodman, was born 
in Westbrook, Maine, June 20, 1872, and 
acquired his earlier literary education in the 
public schools of that city, graduating from 
the high school in 1890. He then took the 
scientific course at the J^Iaine ^^■esleyan Semi- 
nary, Kent's Hill, and was graduated from 
that institution in 1892. .After spending one 
year as ckrk in his father's drug store and a 
like time as reporter on the stafT of the Port- 
land Evening Express, he determined to enter 



the profession of medicine ; and to that end 
he matriculated at the medical department of 
Bowdoin College, completed the course of that 
institution, and graduated with the degree of 
M. D. in 1897, ciiin laude, and with the honors 
of the valedictory. After graduating he re- 
ceived the appointment of house surgeon to 
the Maine General Hospital and remained 
there one year. He began his professional 
career at South Windham, j\Iaine, remained 
there for five years, and has since practiced in 
his native city of Westbrook. He holds mem- 
bership in the American Medical Association, 
the Maine State Medical Society, the Port- 
land and the Westbrook Medical Clubs. He at 
present holds a commission from the governor 
as contract surgeon of the National Guard of 
the State of Maine. 

He married, February 25, 1904, Wilna Frost 
Newcomb, of Westbrook, daughter of Erwin 
B. and Ellen ( Pennell) Newcomb. Two chil- 
dren have been born of this marriage: Charles 
B., born November 30, 1904, and George AI. 
Jr., born May 6, 1907.

(II) Jedediah, son of Robert 
JORDAN Jordan, was born in Falmouth, 

Maine, and died in 1735. He

(II) Jeremiah, youngest son of 
JORDAN Rev. Robert and Sarah (Win- 
ter) Jordan, was born at Fal- 
mouth, Maine, about 1663, and died in 1729. 
The place where he was born was the old 
family plantation at Spurwink, afterwards Fal- 
mouth and now Cape Elizabeth. This estate 
had been inherited from the father of Mrs. 
Robert Jordan, Mr. John Winter, a great 
landed proprietor. Rev. Robert Jordan and 
his family lived on this place from 1648 till 
1675, when the house was burned by the In- 
dians, and they moved to Newcastle, New 
Hampshire, where the clergyman died four 
years later. The "Old Plantation" at Spur- 
wink, containing about one thousand acres, 
was bequeathed to Mrs. Jordan with the pro- 
vision that it should go to Jeremiah at her 
death. The son was sixteen years of age at 
the time of his father's decease, and he con- 
tinued to live with his mother at Newcastle 
till his marriage in 1688. Soon after this 
Jeremiah Jordan removed to Scarborough, 
Maine, where he occupied the Nonesuch Farm, 
containing two thousand acres, which had be- 
longed to his mother. It was here that his 
two children were born, and it was here that he 
raised the provisions that he sold to the gov- 
ernment. The following document has been 
preserved: "Blackpoint," Oct. 4. 1703. This 
signifies that we have taken on board the Sloop 
Crowndhen, Mr. Bena. Gold, master, a thou- 
sand and twenty nine pounds of pork which 
Mr. Jeremiah Jordan owner weighed by ye 
Governor's order to be delivered at ye stores 
at Great Island." Three years later a com- 
plaint was filed at Kittery, Maine, by Pela 
\\'hittemore that the pork, through somebody's 
negligence, "or for want of salt was much 
damnified so that I could never dispose of 
more than half of it." It is not strange that 
the pork was not properly salted, for on .A.u- 
gust 10, 1703, Jeremiah Jordan and his wife 
were captured by a hostile band of Indians, 
and on the same day, Domincus Jordan, a 
brother, who lived on the east side of the Spur- 
wink river, was killed in his own house, and 
his family carried into captivity. The children 
of Jeremiah Jordan, after the capture of their 
parents, were sent to Newcastle, where thev 
probably remained in the care of friends till 
the release of their mother, .^fter remaining 



three years in captivity, she was permitted to 
come back from Canada. Upon her return 
she made her home in Newcastle, which was 
probably her native place. Jeremiah Jordan 
was kept in Canada a number of years, part 
of the time with the Indians and later with 
the French. He was then carried to France, 
where he remained some years, being finally 
released, and returning, first to Spurwink, then 
to Newcastle. Owing to the exposure and 
hardships through which he had passed, he was 
not recognized by any of his friends, who all 
supposed he had been dead for years. He 
proved his identity by showing the scars on his 
breast, caused by fire or water when he was 
quite young, which were remembered by some 
of the family. From that time he was called 
"French Jeremy" to distinguish him from 
others of the same name. He probably re- 
mained at Newcastle till after the death of 
his wife, and then accompanied his son, Jere- 
miah (2), to Falmouth in 1725. About 1688 
Jeremiah Jordan married Katherine, whose 
maiden name is unknown, and they had two 
children: Jeremiah (2), whose sketch fol- 
lows; and Deborah, born about i6g6, married 
Tames Randell, of Newcastle, New Hampshire. 

(III) Jeremiah (2), only son of Jeremiah 
(i) and Katharine Jordan, was born about 
1693, probably on the Nonesuch Farm, at 
Scarborough, Maine, and he died about 1764. 
His parents were carried into captivity when 
he was ten years of age, and the boy and his 
sister Deborah were brought up at Newcastle, 
New Hampshire. Jeremiah (2) Jordan was 
living at Newcastle as late as 1724. and in 
1728 he was living at Falmouth, now Cape 
Elizabeth, Maine. His first wife, who was 
probably the mother of his five children, may 
have died between those dates. About 171 5 
he married Catharine Randell, daughter of 
James Randell. of Newcastle, New Hampshire. 
There were five children : i. James, born 1716, 
married Phebe Mitchell. 2. Elizabeth, 1719. 
married Moses Hanscomb, of Falmouth. 3. 
Jeremiah (3), whose sketch follows. 4. De- 
borah, 1723, married Solomon Bragdon, of 
.Scarborough. 3. Hepzibah, 1749, married 
Styleman Jordan, of Newcastle, New Hamp- 
shire. The second wife of Jeremiah (2) Jor- 
dan was Sarah, but her maiden name is un- 
known. 

(IV) Jeremiah (3), second son of Jere- 
miah (2) and Catharine (Randell) Jordan, 
was born in 1721, probably at Newcastle, New 
Hampshire. At the age of seven, or earlier, 
he moved with his parents to Falmouth, Maine. 
He must have spent his life in that neighbor-

cesslul ill making his escape. W hile living 
among the Canadian Indians he became quite 
familiar with the dialects of several of the 
tribes, and that knowledge served him a use- 
ful purpose in later years, lie returned to 
Spurwink in 1715 and lived in tiiat town dur- 
ing the remaining years of his life. He was a 
very active man in public affairs, holding sev- 
eral important town offices and was one of 
the selectmen the first year after the incor-

his father more than four hundred acres of 
good land, but he himself added materially to 
his inherited possessions. He was lieutenant 
colonel of the militia raised in Cumberland 
county and served in the defense of the sea- 
coast ; and his name appears on the roll of 
field and staff officers for the year 1779. He 
married, August 2, 1740, Hannah Woodbury, 
of Beverly, Massachusetts, and by her had 
nine children, all born in Falmouth: i. Tri.s-

(VII) Samuel, son of William and Ann 
(Leach) Jordan, was born at Raymond, 
Maine, July 6, 1805, and died on his home 
farm in Deering, Maine, December 14, 1880. 
After the death of his father, when Samuel 
was about fifteen years old, he went to West- 
brook, now the Deering district of Portland, 
and for the next two years was in the employ 
of Elisha North, a merchant of that town. 
After that he was a student at Hebron Acad- 
emy, where he pursued a thorough course of 
study with the view of entering the United 
States Military Academy at West Point, New 
York, with the ultimate intention of entering 
the army ; but in deference to the wishes of 
his mother he abandoned that idea and turned 
his attention to mercantile pursuits. After 
leaving the academy he went to Woodford's 
Corners and became agent for the sale of 
combs manufactured by E. D. Woodford. His 
agency extended throughout the New England 
states, the Canadian provinces and as far soutli 
as Baltimore. Maryland. In 1832 he acquired 
a partnership interest in the business con- 
ducted by his employer, Mr. Woodford, and 
the style of the firm became Woodford & Jor- 
dan. This relation was maintained for the

STATE OF MAINE. 



next six years and during that period the 
firm's business was increased by the addition 
of a tin manufacturing- department ; and when 
the partnership was dissolved Mr. Jordan con 
tinued the manufacture of tinware in company 
with Gerry Cook, the firm name being Cook 
& Jordan. This business was continued with 
gratifying success for about three years, when 
the junior partner withdrew and purchased the 
farm formerly owned by Captain Thomas Seal, 
his father-in-law, situated in the town of Deer- 
ing, and afterward devoted his attention chiefly 
to farming pursuits, although he was variously 
interested in other business enterprises and 
somewhat prominently identified with the po- 
litical history of the county. For six years 
he was president of the Westbrook Bank, also 
a director of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence 
Railroad Company, now a part of the Grand 
Trunk system. From 1857 to 1861 he was 
postmaster of Portland, during the Buchanan 
administration, for Mr. Jordan was a staunch 
Democrat and a warm admirer of James Bu- 
chanan. In 1848 and 1849 he was a member 
of the lower house of the state legislature. 
"Mr. Jordan was a man of more than ordinary 
character and force and had he been educated 
with a view to a public career would have 
been a leader among men anywhere. In mind 
and body he was sturdy and strong, but al- 
ways frank and self-possessed. Tenacious of 
his own views and convictions, he always was 
manly and large-hearted in his intercourse with 
others — belonging to that type of men whose 
natures are so virile that their very faults are 
never despicable. His opinions were always 
sincerely sought in all matters of public con- 
cern and were never for a moment misunder- 
stood or lightly treated. He believed in the 
hearty and prompt contribution of individual 
thought to the current of public discussion, and 
so filled the full measure of a citizen's duty, 
and died in the fulness of years, beloved of 
family and friends ; and on every hand will 
be remembered as a brave, able and honest 
man, and a splendid type of the old New- 
England stock which breathed into all our 
institutions the breath of its own courage and 
hopefulness." (Portland Daily Ncivs, Dec. 15, 
1880.) On November 7, 1832, Samuel Jor- 
dan married Eunice Quinby Seal, born West- 
brook, Februarv 4, 1808, died Alay 23, 1863,

(VIII) Horace Malcolm, son of Samuel and 
Eunice Quinby (Seal) Jordan, was born in 
Deering, now Portland, Maine, December 10, 
1839, and acquired his earlier literary educa- 
tion in private schools, Yarmouth Academy 
and Westbrook Seminary, in which he was 
fitted for college. In 1854 he entered Bow- 
doin College, for the classical course, and 
was graduated with the degree of A. B. .\fter 
leaving college he traveled somewhat exten- 
sively for his health, and later took up the 
study of law with jMr. Justice Clifford, at 
Portland. In 1861 he was admitted to prac- 
tice in the courts of this state and became a 
member of the Cumberland bar. In 1863 he 
went to New Orleans and was appointed aide- 
de-camp on the stafT of General George F. 
Shepley, then military governor of Louisiana. 
He remained in the south at the close of the 
civil war, chiefly at New Orleans, where he 
w'as admitted to the bar and for a short time 
practiced law in association with the law firm 
of Rouse & Grant. While there he drifted 
into newspaper work, and for some time pre-

Nezv Orleans Republican. Returning to Maine 
in 1870, Mr. Jordan for the next two years 
was editor of the Maine Standard, at Augusta,

JORDAN son of Dominicus and Hannah 

( Tri.stram) Jordan, was born at 
Spurwink in 1G84. At the age of eighteen 
years he was carried a captive to Canada, and 
after living six years with the Indians spent 
one year with the French at "Three Rivers." 
With two other prisoners he managed to es- 
cape, assisted by an Indian woman named 
Mary, and she guided them through the woods 
to Casco Bay. Settling at Winter Harbor, he 
engaged in trade, carrying on for many years 
the only store in that place, and as he had 
obtained a good knowledge of the Indian 
language while in captivity, he was able to 
render valuable services to the government as 
an interpreter. Subsequently to 1717 he acted 
as the authorized agent for the government 
in its transactions with the Indians, and he 
was also captain of the local militia company. 
He was a man of unusual energy and perse- 
verance, was very prominent in civic and re- 
ligious affairs, and a member of the Congre- 
gational church. In 1727 he erected a sub- 
stantial residence near Biddeford pool, which 
was still in a good state of preservation in 
1872. Captain Jordan died December 20, 
1742. He was married at York in 17 18 to 
Olive Plaisted, daughter of James and Marv 
{ Rishworth) Plaisted, of Brunswick, Maine. 
In 1744 she married for her second husband 
Rev. James Smith. Her death occurred in 
1763. The children of her first union were:

Hovey) ; Sarah (who became the wife of Rev. 
Samuel Hill) ; Hannah (who became the wife 
of Rev. Moses Morrill); Samuel (who mar- 
ried Mercy liourn) ; Tristram, who will be 
again referred tn; and Mary (who became the 
wife of Philip tioldihwaite, of Boston). 

(IV) Colonel Tristram, youngest son of 
Captain Samuel and Olive (Plaisted) Jordan, 
was born at Winter Harbor, May 13, 1731. 
He became one of the first merchants on the 
east side of the Saco river, at the falls, and 
resided in what was known as the Pepperell 
House. At the age of twenty-three, in 1754, 
he was chosen a selectman and at about the 
same time was commissioned a captain in the 
militia. In 1787 he was chosen a senator from 
A'ork county to the Massachusetts general 
court. At the close of the revolutionary war 
he removed from the falls to his estate at 
Deep Brook, where he died November i, 1821, 
aged ninety years. In addition to the offices 
mentioned, he served as a magistrate for 
many years, and in 1776 was commissioned a

(For preceding generations see Kobert Jordan I.) 

(HI) Nathaniel, youngest son 
JORDAN of Dominicus and Hannah 

(Tristram) Jordan, was born 
1696, at Cape Elizabeth, Maine, died 1783. 
But little can be definitely learned of his ca- 
reer by his descendants. In 1703, with his 
mother and the remainder of the children of 
the liousehL.ld, he was made pri.soncr by the 
Indians, but later redeemed from captivity, ow- 
ing to the treaty of 1713. They returned and 
improved their share of the old homestead 

estate. Married (first) Dorothy — , in 

1717. Married (second) in 1741, Mary Cut- 
levier, who survived him, and attained the 
age of ninety-one years, as indicated by the 
slate tombstone in the cemetery at Cape llliza- 
beth. The children of Nathaniel Jordan were 
as follows : Ebenezer, Sarah, Nathaniel, 
Joshua, Benjamin, Ebenezer and Solomon. 

(IV) Nathaniel (2), eldest son of Nathan- 
iel (i) Jordan, by his wife Dorothy, was 
born 1733 or thereabouts. He married, in 
1756, Susannah Hill, by whom the following 
children were born at Scarborough, Maine : 
Abner, Ephraim, Nathaniel, Benjamin, Eliza 
Sarah, John H., Mary, Martha, Abigail, Han- 
nah, Sally. The youngest child was born No- 
vember 10, 1774. 

(V) Abner, eldest child of Nathaniel (2) 
and Susannah (Hill) Jordan, was born 1760, 
at Cape Elizabeth, Maine, died at Lisbon, 
Maine, September 26, 1819. He served in 
the revolutionary army, though young at the 
time of that struL;gle for independence. In 
the spring of 1790, with his wife and children, 
he moved from Cape Elizabeth to what is now 
known as Webster, Maine. There he lodged 
in a log cabin, built two years prior by his 
brother. He married. May 21, 1786, Hannah 
Wentworth, born 1768. died August 31, 1849, 
at Lisbon, Maine. Their children were: 
Nathan B., John Wentworth, Hannah, Abner, 
Nathaniel, Timothy, Sarah Bartlett, Benniiig 
Wentworth and Lydia. The youngest child 
was born in 1813. 

(VI) Nathaniel (3), fifth child of Abner 
and Hannah (Wentworth) Jordan, was born 
January 31, 1799, on the old plantation home- 



stead. He died September 11, 1856. In 18.;',, 
at Danville, he married Anna, daughter of 
Ebenezer Jordan (a relative far removed), by 
whom was born the following children : Sarah, 
Hannah, Silas Curtis, Mary P., Ebenezer, Ly- 
dia H., Wcntwonh, Abner, Horatio Garcelcn 
and Abbie C. 

(VTI) Wentworth, son of Nathaniel (3) 
and Anna (Jordan) Jordan, was born Novem- 
ber 17, 1837, at Lisbon, Maine, and was edu- 
cated at the common schools of Webster. At 
the age of twenty years he commenced to 
learn the blacksmith's trade, which he con- 
tinued to follow until he mastered it at Port- 
land. In 1861 he went to California, where 
he worked at mining and the forge and anvil 
for four years. He then returned to Lisbon 
and continued to work at his trade until 1874, 
when he opened the "Lisbon House," a hotel 
which for thirty-three years was well and most 
favorably known for its right good cheer and 
the homelike hosi)itality extended. Pie mar- 
ried Elizabeth Knights, by whom was born 
two children, Jo.seph, who died aged six- 
teen years, born at Iowa Hill, California, Feb- 
ruary 17, 1864: Forrest Elmer, born October 
17, 1866, at Lisbon, Maine. 

(VIII) Forrest Elmer, youngest child of 
Wentworth and Elizabeth (Knights) Jordan, 
born at Lisbon, Maine, October 17, 1866, ob- 
tained his education at the schools of New 
Sharon and later attended the high school of 
Lisbon. After leaving school he worked at 
painting and paperhanging for a time, but later 
took up carpentering and followed that for 
three years, after which he entered the em- 
ploy of E. H. Lunt as a clerk in a general 
merchandise store, where he remained about 
one year. He then went to Boston, Massa- 
chusetts, and secured a position with the 
American Express Company, with whom he 
remained two years. He then became '"buyer 
under chief warden. General Bridges, of ili 
Massachusetts .State Prison, at Charlestown, 
where he remained about three years. .At the 
time of the riot among the prisoners of that 
institution, had it not been for the tact used by 
the warden, many of the prisoners would have 
escaped, and the death of many of the keepers 
would doubtless have ensued. Mr. Jordan was 
in the room at the hour of the outbreak, but 
escaped uninjured. After severing his connec- 
tion with the prison, he was employed in the 
Wyman Brothers' produce market, in Boston, 
then entered the wholesale produce business. 
Later he sold the last-named business and re- 
turned to Lisbon, Maine, and in July, 1905, 
purchased the grocery business of W. W.

Smitli, which lie has successfully conducted 
since. Mr. Jordan is identified with the Inde- 
pendent Order of Odd Fellows, Knights of 
Pythias, Knights of the Golden Eagle, Modern 
VVoodmen of America. In his political affilia- 
tions he is a Republican, while in church con- 
nection he is an attendant of the Methodist 
Episcopal denomination. He married, Decem- 
ber 25, 1891, Annie L., daughter of Roscoe 
G. and Christine (Whitney) Green, of Lis- 
bon, Maine. They have three children : Louise 
Beatrice, Marion Thelma and Kenneth N. 



The Jordans of the following 
JORDAN sketch are thought to be de- 
scended from that pioneer 
clergyman, Rev. Robert Jordan, who, in 1641, 
was established at Richmond's Island, now 
Portland. 

(I) Joseph Jordan resided in Oldtown, 
Maine. In 1849 he joined the great army of 
gold seekers and went to California. After 
reaching that very remote territory he wrote 
that he had struck a paying claim, and as an 
evidence of his success he remitted to his 
family $1,800 in gold. This was the last ever 
heard of him, and what his fate was has never 
been discovered. He married and had chil- 
dren : I-'rank. a sailor, who was drowned at 
sea; Annie E., married E. E. Hues, of Haver- 
hill, Massachusetts; George I. 

(II) George Ivory, youngest child of Jo- 
seph Jordan, was born in Oldtown, May 16, 
1836. He was educated in the common schools, 
and at an early age learned the shoemaker's 
trade. In 1862 he enlisted in response to the 
call of the president for volunteers to serve 
nine months, and was a private in Captain 
Libby's company, Twelfth New Hampsi:ire 
Volunteer Infantry, and served in the Arm\'

The name <>{ Williams is of 
Wll T.IAMS ancient Welsh origin, and 

has became one of the most 
prolific names in Great Britain and America. 
In Wales it was formerly Ap Williams, and 
it is worthy of note that Morgan ap Williams, 
of Glamorganshire, gentleman, married a sis- 
ter of Lord Thomas Cromwell, afterward Earl 
of Essex, who was an ancestor of the famous 
Puritan reformer, Oliver Cromwell. 

(I) Thomas Williams, the fir^t American 
ancestor of this line, came from England, h'cb- 
niary 18, 1717, "when gooseberries were in 
blow," and reached Boston, April 17, 1717, 
"when the snow was very deep." He prob- 
ably (lied at Bath, Maine, but the e.xact date is 
not known. He was employed in teaching 
Latin in Boston, and subsequently removed to 
Maine. Thomas Williams lived at Winne- 
gance in 1729. and remaining there became the 
first permanent settler of ]^)ath. It is said that 
he was a physician, and that he often ex- 
pressed regrets at having left England. The 
name of the wife of Thomas \Villiams cannot 
be ascertained, but there were at least three 
sons, and one daughter, who married James 
Hunter, of Topsham. Thomas, one of the 
sons, married Margaret Drununond in 1746, 
and was lieutenant of the Georgetown militia 
in 1746. George, another son, signed a peti- 
tion for a new parish in Georgetown in 1753, 
which parish afterwards became the town of 
Bath. The sketch of Samuel is found in the 
succeeding paragraph. 

(II) Samuel, son of Thomas Williams, was 
born about 1730, probably in what is now 
Bath, Maine, and died in that neighborhood 
about 1800. In 1761 he bought parts of lots 
on Sebascodigan or Great Island, Harpswell ; 
and he was living at "Duck Cove" in 1799. On 
September 14, 1744, he married Mercy, daugh- 
ter of Anthony and Mercy (Hodgkius) 
Coombs, of Brunswick. Anthony Coombs was 
originally from Gloucester, Massachusetts, and 
migrated to Falmouth, and thence to New 
Meadows, Brunswick, in 1739. Mrs. Mercy 
(Coombs) Williams died in Thomaston, 
Maine, in September, 1824, aged ninety-four 
years. Samuel and Mercy (Coombs) Wil- 
liams had five sons: Samuel (2), who lived 
on the Island; Benjamin, Daniel and Peter, 
who all moved to Thomaston, and George, 
whose sketch follows. The name of Samuel 
Williams occurs twice on the revolutionary 
rolls, and it is thought that both father and son 
were in the service. Samuel Williains en- 
listed June 10, 1775, and served two months 
and four days as a private in Captain James 



Curtis's company. He re-enlisted August 9, 
1775, and served five months and five days. A 
Sanniel Williams of Ilarpswelf was sergeant in 
Captain Nathaniel Larrabee's company, enlist- 
ing' Ji''y 9' '775» '""1 serving si.x montlis and 
seven' days. It is thought that these were 
father and .son. 

(III) George, son of Samuel and Mercy 
(Coombs) Williams, was born at Harpswell, 
Maine, August 3, 1777, and died at Durham, 
November I, 1853. He was a carpenter and 
farmer, and lived most of his life in Durham, 
though there was a period of about twenty 
years, ending in 1825, when he made his home 
in Lewiston. About 1800 he married Mabel, 
daughter of Noah and ^ label (Wade) Litch- 
field, of South Lewiston. She was born in 
Scituate, Massachusetts, February 29, 1780, 
and died at Durham, November i, 1S53. Her 
father, Noah Litchfield, was born in Scituate, 
January 24, 1753, and on July 9, 1778, married 
Mabel Wade, of Scituate, who was born June 
9, 1758. Noah Litchfield was the first town 
clerk of Lewiston, and died November 17, 
1827; his wife died July 12, 1838. Children of 
George and Mabel (Litchfield) Williams: i. 
Charles, .August 17, 1801, married Eleanor 
Randall. 2. Samuel, December 18, 1802, mar-

(IV) Barnard, third son of George and 
Mabel (Litchfield) ^^'illiams, was born Feb- 
ruary 15, 1807, at Lewiston, Maine, and died 
at Durham. When a youth he returned with 
his parents to the old home at Durham, and 
there he spent his long and useful life. He 
was a man of irreproachable character, and a 
good citizen. About 1840 he married Eliza- 
beth Augusta, daughter of Jacob (2) and Abi- 
gail (Scott) Herrick, and granddaughter of 
Rev. Jacob Herrick. of Durham. She was 
born February 9, 181 5, and died June 21, 
1864. Children: i. George Jacob, born No- 
vember II, 1842, was nine years a sailor, but

medicine at Bowdoin College, and two years in 
a New York hospital, and has practiced at Au- 
burn, Maine, for some years. On Alarch 3, 
1872, he married Emma J. Harlow, of Liver- 
more Falls. They have two children, Ethel

Auburn, October 16, 1902 (see Jordan, VIII) ; 
Edward. 



Colonel William. Beale, progenitor, 
BEAL first appears at York, Maine, as 

early as 1653. He was from Lon- 
don, a partner in the firm of John Beex & 
Company. To this company Richard Leader 
sold his saw mills at Piscataqua, CJctober 5, 
1653, a quarter to John Beex, of London, Eng- 
land, merchant ; a quarter to Richardson, Lon- 
don, ironmonger; and a quarter (an eighth 
each) to Colonel William Beale and Captain 
Thomas Alderne. The other quarter he sold 
to Beex, Hutchinson and Alderne, February 
14, 1655. (See York Deeds, folio 73-40.) 
Beale seems to have lived at York for a time, 
though we know little or nothing more about 
him. He was succeeded evidently by his son 
Arthur, mentioned below. 

(II) Arthur Eieal, son of Colonel William 
Beale, was born in London about 1620 and 
came to York, Maine, 1655. .^t an early date 
an entrance to York river was known as Beal's 
Neck. Arthur Beal bought a tract of land on 
York river near the harbor, by deed, dated 
November 9, 1674, near his other property. 
He was a fisherman by trade and owned a fish- 
ing shallop of six or seven tons burden, June 
4, 1667, when he, Richard White and Manner- 



ing (or ]\Iainwaring) Hilton, all of York, 
mortgaged their real estate and personal prop- 
erty to Francis Johnson, of Boston, for the 
sum of ninety-nine pounds, which was to be 
paid in fish, oil, mackerel or staves (barrel 
staves). He signed with a mark that was very 
like a capital "D." His son Arthur used for 
his mark the capital letters "A" and "B'' joined 
in a monograph, and through this difference in 
the signatures we are able to distinguish the 
records of the two men. A bond dated No- 
vember 10, 1674, from Arthur Beale "Sr." 
indicates that the son was then of age. This 
bond was for fifty pounds for the purchase of 
a tract of land, to be paid for ten pounds in 
each year from 1675 to 1679. The Johnson 
mortgage was discharged December 26, 1682. 
Children: i. Arthur, mentioned below. 2. 
William, mentioned below. 

(Ill) Arthur (2), son of Arthur Beal. was 
born about 1650 probably at York, Maine. For 
many years he was a prominent man at York 
and owned much property about the mouth of 

the York river. He married Anne , 

who was probably a Hilton. William Hilton 
calls Beal a "brother" when deeding March 5, 
1 681, land granted him by the town on the 
south side of the York river. Of course. Hil- 
ton's wife may have been Beal's sister. Beal 
deeded land .\pril 6, 1683, twenty-one acres 
at Brave-boat harbor near the bridge, a town 
grant from York. Beal and Hilton deeded 
three acres of land on the York river, January 

16, 1698, to Daniel Black. According to a 
mortgage dated December i, 1699, to William 
Pepperell, Beal lived on the south side of the 
York river by the harbor mouth. Beal deeded 
land to his only son Edward February 27, 
1 701 (York Deeds vii. folio 64) and finally all 
his lands at York including homestead April 

17, 171 1, shortly before his death (York Deeds 
vii, folio 194). He deeded ten acres of land 
to William Pearse, and wife Mary, his daugh- 
ter, January 18, 171 1, and to Elishua Ailing 
and his wife Elizabeth, another daughter (vii, 
folio 219). His will was dated December i, 
1699, proved C)ctober 2, 171 1, and the inven- 
tory filed September 3, 171 1. He mentions Ed- 
ward by name and other children. Children : 
I. Edward, mentioned below. 2. Elizabeth, 
married Elishua (or Elisha) Allen (or Ailing). 
3. Mary, married William Pearse. 

(Ill) \\'ilUam (2). son of Arthur ( 1) Deal, 
as shown by the land in his possession along- 
side Arthur's on the south side of York river, 
was born about 1660-65. He married Jane 
Trafton. daughter of Thomas Trafton, ofYork, 
and sister of Zaccheus, Joseph and Thomas

Trafldii. I Ic must have li-fl York at the time 
of King PhiHp's war and probably took refuge 
at [i)s\vich, wliere his son ( Jbadiah remained. 
This family may be related to William Beal, 
of Marblchead, who had a .somewhat numerous 
posterity. He returned to York and when his 
son William was of age, November 8, 17 17, 
deeded to him ten acres on the northwest side 
of the lot on Fulling Mill brook extending to 
the Kittery line. Like all the others of the 
family mentioned above, who.sc signatures 
were found, he used a characteristic mark. In 
1 718 his son Obadiah was of Ipswich, but he 
deeded him ten acres at Fulling !\lill brook 
extending to the Kittery bounds in York, Oc- 
tober II, 1718. William and his wife Jane 
deeded a seventh jiart of a tract on York river, 
originally granted to his wife's family. Trafton, 
adjoining Edwanl I'.eal's land (formerly his 
father's.) A deed dated April 13, 1722, William 
Beal to Zaccheus Trafton, states the relation- 
ship to the Traftons. Another seventh of this 
Trafton estate William Beal bought March 31. 
1724. It adjoined the old Arthur Beal estate 
and extended to the Kittery line, and was 
some of the land deeded to his sons. Children : 
I. William, was of age in 1717. deeded land to 
Francis Carman, who married Abishag, sister 
of Beal. 2. Abishag, married Francis Car- 
man 3. Zaccheus, lived in Kittery in 1719. 
4. Obadiah. removed from Ipswich, Massachu- 
setts, to York, about 1720; he was in Ipswich 
in 1718, when his father gave him a lot of land 
in York and was of York when he and his 
wife Mary deeded this lot. November 4, 1726, 
to his sister Mary. 5. Mary, spinster, in 1726. 
(IV) Edward, only son of Arthur (2) Beal, 
was born in York or some town in which the 
family took refuge during the war, about 1675. 
The property he received from his father is 
mentioned above. He had a grant from the 
town of York, May i, 1695. laid out January 
19, 1699-1700, sold thirty acres on York river 
from this grant April 29, 1703, to Samuel Don- 
nell. Beal married, before 1703, Elizabeth 

• . He mortgaged land to William Pep- 

perell in 1713 and the mortgage was dis- 
charged April 2, 1718. Beal bought twenty 
acres on the border of Godfrey pond, January 
26. 171 7. He sold one hundred and forty-four 
acres of land at Beal's Neck, at the entrance of 
York river, January 31, 1 71 7- 18. This was 
near Beal's home, as stated in the deed. Ed- 
ward mortgaged his lands again in 1721-22. 
He and his wife deed a house lot of six acres 
on York river to their son Manerin (Mainwar- 
ing, named for Mainwaring Hilton, mentioned 
above). Children of Edward and Elizabeth: 



I . Nicholas, given a Iiouse lot by parents I-'eb- 
ruary 7, 1728, southwest side of York river 
adjoining the homestead. 2. Mainwaring, a 
mariner, born about 1700, bought land of Kent 
& Swett in York, June i, 1724, and received as 
a gift from parents I-'ebruary 27, 1727-28. ad- 
joining land given by his father to Stephen 
Greenleaf. 3. Wife of Stephen Greenleaf. 

The family became well entrenched in 
York antl York county. Jn the revolutionary 
war there enlisted from York alone Zachariah 
Beal, Josiah Beal, Joseph Beal, Joshua I5eal 
and iMatthias Beal, while to the adjoining town 
of Kittery was credited Henry and Joseph 
Beal, who probably resided near the line on 
the old I'eal place. 

(\') Zebulon Beal, grandson of one of these 
mentioned above, was born in York, July 29, 
1754. He removed to Sanford, Maine, where 
he purchased land and carried on a farm. He 
married, October 20, 1781, Lucy Boston, born 
July 4, 1760, died November 27, 1841. He 
died in .Sanford, January 26, 1843. Children:

(\''in) Nathaniel Butler, son of Sheldon 
Hobbs Beal, was born in Sanford, March 7, 

1828, died March 28, 1899. He was brought 
up on his father's farm in Avon, whither they 
had moved when he was but three years old. 
When Nathaniel B. was ten years old he vis- 
ited a neighboring farmer, who gave him a 
sack of apple pomace left from making cider. 
This pomace the boy carried home, a distance 
of four miles, and sowed the apple seed start- 
ing an apple orchard which proved a valuable 
and productive orchard in later years. At the 
age of twelve he went to work for a neighbor, 
John Wilbur, taking entire charge of his farm, 
and for a year doing the work of a man. He 
went to the public schools winters, being 
obliged to rise at four o'clock in the morning to 
do the work, and then walk a mile to the school 
house. He early formed the habit of total 
abstinence, rather unusual at that time, nml 
never partook of liquor or tobacco during his 
life. At the age of nineteen he was employed 
by Deacon Oren Robbins, of Phillips Village, 
in his grist mill. Soon after his marriage he 
started in business for himself as a trader in 
general merchandise in Phillips Village. His 
health, however, coinpelled him to seek out- 
door employment, and he went into the cattle 
business, becoming a drover. During the civil 
war and for many years afterward he helped to 
supply the Boston market with beef. He was 
active in the building up of the town of Phil- 
lips, was one of its selectmen, holding the 
office for many years, and was deputy sheriff 
of the county. He was twice drafted for ser- 
vice in the civil war, but was unable to pass 
the physical examination, and was thus pre- 
vented from serving in the army. He was 



instrumental in the forming of the Phillips 
Savings Bank and the Union National Bank, 
of which in 1875 he became president, and so 
remained until its charter e.xpired in 1895. A 
year before the expiration of the charter a 
new bank was formed, the Phillips National 
Bank, and Mr. Beal was made its first presi- 
dent, retaining that office for twenty years. He 
was for many years a trustee of the Savings 
Bank. In 1879 h^ was one of the builders of 
the Sandy River railroad, and one of its first 
presidents, holding the office until 1892. Dur- 
ing the latter part of the time he was its su- 
perintendent also, and to him the successful 
construction is chiefly due. In politics he vvas 
always a Democrat, a leader of his party in die 
northern part of Franklin county, though he 
was a believer in protection and sound money. 
He was twice nominated as representative to 
the general court, and once as senator and 
judge: but though he ran far ahead of his 
ticket, the district being strongly Republican, 
he was defeated. At one time, during tlie days 
of the Greenback party, three brothers were 
nominated from the same district on as many 
tickets, Nathaniel B. being the Democratic 
nominee, Wilson C. the Republican, and Brad- 
ford the Greenback. Wilson received the elec- 
tion. He was very fond of music, and sang in 
the choir of the Free Will Baptist church for 
forty years, being also chorister many years. 
In religious belief he was a Universalist. 

He married, in 1849, iMary Robbins, daugh- 
ter of Deacon Orren and Mary (Huntoon) 
Robbins, of Phillips. She was born Novem- 
ber 25, 1828, died May 9, 1902. Through her 
father's family, she was granddaughter of Me- 
hitable ( Ladd ) Robbins, who was descended 
from Daniel Ladd, the immigrant, who came 
from London in the ship "Mary and John," 
sailing January 30, 1633, and settled first in 
Ipswich, Massaclnisetts, and later was one of 
the twelve original founders of Haverhill, Mas- 
sachusetts. The Ladds can be traced to the 
Earls of Ladd in Norway, .\. D. 861. (See 
Chase's History of Haverhill.) They married 
into the royal families of Norway, Sweden and

The Butler familv is descended 
BCTLER from the ninth 'Duke of Or- 
mond. The Dukes of Ormond 
were created under Edward HI of England, 
and placed over the county Palatine of Or- 
mond, Tipperary, Irelaiifl. They were sent 
from England to Ireland by Henry II of Eng- 
land in 1 172. They were also stationed there 
under King John. They originally came to 
England with William the Conqueror, from 
(ilanville. near Caen. France. (See .American 
Family Genealogy, p. 31 ; also Thomas Butler 
and his Descendants, p. 20 and 21 ; also vol- 
ume for 1848, N. E. G. & A. R. P. 355.) 

(I) Thomas Butler settled in Berwick, 
Maine, about 1690. He was the fourth son 
of the ninth Duke of Ormond. He had a son 
Moses, mentioned below. 

(II) Moses, son of Thomas Butler, resided 
in Berwick. In 1740 he was in command of 
a company as captain, and in 1744 recruited 
the Seventh Company of the First Massachu- 
setts Regiment, which he commanded during 
the siege and capture of Louisburg, July 4, 
1745. He was also at the siege of Quebec in 
1734. He had a son Thomas, mentioned be- 
low. 

(HI) Thomas, son of Moses Butler, was an 
ofBcer in the revolution in Captain Ebenezer 
Sullivan's company. Colonel Scammon's regi- 
ment, stationed at Cambridge and vicinity in 
1775. He had a son Nathaniel, mentioned be- 
low. 

(IV) Nathaniel, son of Thomas Butler, 
served in the revolution when a boy. He mar- 
ried Mercy Wentworth, a lineal descendant of 
Elder William Wentworth, who came from 
Alford, Lincolnshire, England, to Exeter, New 
Hampshire, in 1639. Elder William Went- 
worth was the twenty-first descendant of Regi- 
nald Wentworth, who was the proprietor of 
the Lordship of Wentworth, of Strafford, in 
the west of Yorkshire, in the parish of Wath- 
upon-Dearn, nine miles from Sheffield, and 
thirteen miles from Doncastcr. and who was 
living there when William the Conqueror came 
to England in 1066. Nathaniel Butler had a

(Vj Nathaniel (2), son of Nathaniel (ij 
Butler, married Tabitha Joy. He had a daugh- 
ter Tabitha, who married Sheldon Hobbs Beal. 
(See Beal family herewith.) 

William, Count Tank- 

CHAMBERLAIN erville, of Tankerville 
Castle in Normandy, 
who came to England with William the Con- 
queror, was the progenitor of the Chamberlain 
family in England. He himself returned to 
Norrnandy, but his descendants remained in 
England on the land granted to them. 

(H) John De Tankerville, son of the for- 
mer earl, was lord chamberlain to King Henry 
I, and assumed his title as a surname. (Hi) 
Richard, son of John, was also chamberlain 
to King Stephen, and the surname Chamber- 
lain has since his day been that of his family. 
(IV) William Chamberlain was son of Rich- 
ard (3). (V) Robert Chamberlain was son 
of William (4). (VI) Sir Richard Chamber- 
lain was son of Robert (5). (Vll) Sir Rob- 
ert Chamberlain was son of Richard (6). The 
line continues: Sir Richard (VIII), John 
(IX), Thomas (X), John (XI), William 
Chamberlain (XII). The American family 
of which William Chamberlain was the immi- 
grant ancestor, doubtless belongs to this fam- 
ily, though the line of ancestry is not traced. 
The Chamberlain coat-of-arms : Gules, an 
escutcheon argent between eight muUers in 
orle, or. Quartering : Gules a chevron be- 
tween three escallops or. Motto : Virtuti 
nihil invium. Seat : Dunstew in Oxfordshire, 
England. 

(I) William Chamberlain, immigrant an- 
cestor of General Robert Horace Chamber- 
lain, of Worcester, was born in England about 
1620. His brother Thomas was one of the 
three original purchasers of the Dudley farm 
at Billerica, but he settled at Chelmsford, 
Massachusetts. Another brother, Edmund, 
settled first in Woburn, then removed to 
Chelmsford before 1656, when he sold land 
at Billerica. Savage said that Edmund finally 
settled in Woodstock. 

William Chamberlain was admitted an in- 
habitant of Woburn, January 6, 1648, and per- 
mitted to buy land there. He removed to 
Billerica in 1654, about the time his brothers 
left that town, and spent the remainder of his 
life there. He died May 31, 1706, aged 
eighty-six years. His house in Sliawshin 
(Billerica) was on the farm, probably near 
the Woburn road, in tlie southwest part of the 
village. His name first appears on the records 
October, 1654, on a petition to enlarge the 



bounds of the town and to change the name 
to Billerica (Billerikey in original paper). A 
little later, when the committee on militia or- 
dered Sergeant Hills's house to be a garrison, 
William Chamberlain's family was one of 
those assigned to it. He married Rebecca 

, who died September 26, 1692, in the 

prison at Cambridge, where she was held on 
the preposterous charge of witchcraft. Chil- 
dren : Timothy, born at Concord, Alassachu- 
setts, August 13, 1649-50; Isaac, born at Con-

(V) Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, born in 
1770, went from Danvers or Cambridge, Mas- 
sachusetts, to Orrington, Maine, about 1799, 
where he engaged in shipbuilding, and pros- 
pered in this business until in the war of 1812 
the English forces ascending the Penobscot 
river destroyed two of his ships — one lying at 
the dock and another on the stocks. Not able 
to recover his shattered fortunes here, he re- 
moved in 1 81 7 to what is now Brewer, six 
miles further up the river, where he took up a 
large farm, and with his sons interested him- 
self again to some degree in shipbuilding. His 
home was about half a mile above the toll 
bridge, where he died January 23, 1857, aged 
eighty-six years. He was a gentleman of the 
old school, a man of note, and colonel of a 
regiment of militia in the war with England, 
and for some time in command of the post at 
Plastport, Maine. He married Ann Gould, of 
Danvers, Massachusetts. She died February 
19, 1831, aged sixty-eight years. Children: 
Amelia, Anna P. (died young), Thomas 
Gould (also died young), Anna, Joshua, Jef- 
ferson, Ebenezer i\I., John Q. A., and El- 
bridge Gerry. 

(VI) Joshua (2), second .son of Colonel 
Joshua (i) and Ann (Gould) Chamberlain, 
was born in Orrington, September 24. 1800, 
and died August 10, 1880. He was a 
man of much strength of character. He 
resided in P.rewer, where he was a lead- 
ing citizen in both civil and military mat- 
ters. He was county commissioner, lieu- 
tenant-colonel in the militia, and held other 
offices. He married, October, 1827, Sarah 
Dupee, daughter of Billings and Lydia (Du- 
pee) Brastow, of Holden. She was born Au- 
gust 23, 1803, and died November 5, 1888, 
aged eighty-five. She was descended from 
Jean Dupuis (i), born about 1660, who came 
from La Rochelle, France, to Boston, Massa- 
chusetts, in 1685; Charles (2), second son of 
Jean, born 1695, and served in the colonial 
wars: Charles (3) Dupee, third son of Charles 
Dupuis, born 1735, served in the revolution, 
and in the army lists of that war the spelling 
of the name was changed to the present form : 
Lydia (4), fourth daughter of Charles, bom 
1770, married Billings Brastow. Children of 
Joshua (2) Chamberlain: i. Joshua L., men- 
tioned below. 2. Horace B., born November 
14, 1834, died December 7, 1861 ; graduated 
with honor from Bowdoin College in 1857, 
and made a brilliant opening in Bangor as a 



lawyer; married, May 11, 1859, Mary A. 
Wheeler, of Bangor. 3. Sarah B., born No- 
vember 2, 1836, married July 14, 1867, 
Charles O. Farrington, a merchant of Brewer ; 
their children are Alice M. and Dana C. 
Farrington. 4. John Calhoun, born Au- 
gust I, 1838, died at Castine, August 11, 1867, 
of disease contracted while in the arrny; 
graduated from Bowdoin College in 1859, and 
from Bangor Theological Seminary in 1864; 
was in service of the Christian Commission, 
and chaplain of Eleventh \'olunteers in the 
civil war. He married, September 13, 1866, 
Delia F., daughter of John H. Jarvis, of Cas- 
tine, later of Bangor. 5. Thomas Davee, April 
29, 1 84 1, was a soldier in the civil war, serv- 
ing with great distinction, in the line and on 
the stafif, rising to the rank of lieutenant- 
colonel and colonel U. S. V. He married, De- 
cember 13, 1871, Delia F. Chamberlain, widow 
of his brother John ; resided in New York and 
afterward in I5angor, where he died .August 
12, 1896. 

(VII) Governor Joshua L., eldest child of 
Joshua (2) and Sarah Dupee (Brastow) 
Chamberlain, was born in Brewer, September 
8, 1828. He received his early education in 
the public schools of the town and later in 
Major Whiting's military academy at Ells- 
worth, Maine, where he prepared for West 
Point. In 1848. however, he entered Bowdoin 
and graduated from that college in 1852 with 
highest honors. He then entered Bangor The- 
ological Seminary, where in addition to the 
studies of the regular course, he gave earnest 
attention to the Arabic and other oriental 
languages. During his last year here he re- 
ceived calls to several important churches : but 
on graduating he was immediately called to 
Bowdoin College as special instructor in some 
of the studies of the department of natural 
and revealed religion. The next year he was 
elected professor of rhetoric and oratory, and 
the year after, having been relieved of some 
of the duties of this chair, he was appointed 
also instructor in the French and German 
languages, which service he continued for two 
years, when he was elected professor of the 
Alodem Languages of Europe. In July, 1862, 
he received leave of absence from the college 
for two years in order to prosecute his studies 
in Europe, but the war of secession being now 
serious and a call coming from the President 
for more troops, he immediately tendered his 
services to Governor Washburn for anv mili- 
tary duty for which he might be thought cap- 
able. This was strenuously combatted bv his 
colleagues in the college faculty, who carried 



134 



STATE OF MAINE. 



their opposition to the length of a formal pro- 
test. He was offered the colonelcy of a regi- 
ment about to be formed ; bnt deeming it wiser 
first to serve under some officer of the regular 
army, he accepted the appointment of lieuten- 
ant-colonel of the Twentieth Maine infantry, 
then being organized, of which Adalbert Ames, 
of the regular artillery, was to be colonel. He 
.entered at once upon the organization of this 
regiment, receiving his commission on the 8th 
of August, 1862, and devoting himself to the 
study and practice of his duties, he completed 
the organization of the- regiment of a thousand 
men, and on the 29th of that month, it was 
mustered into the United States service for 
three years or during the war. The command 
now turned over to Colonel Ames, he as- 
sumed his place as lieutenant-colonel, and in 
that capacity left witli the regiment on the 
next day for the seat of war. 

The regiment was assigned to Butterfield's 
famous Light Brigade, Morell's Division, 
Porter's Fifth Corps, Army of the Potomac, 
and immediately entered upon the severe ex- 
periences of the Maryland campaign. On the 
forced march to South Mountain and to the 
Antietam battle-field, all the qunlities of manly 
endurance and pride were called into exercise. 
During that battle the regiment occupied sup- 
porting positions and made movements of im- 
portance under fire, but was not actively en- 
gaged. On September 20 a heavy reconnais- 
sance was made across Shepardstown ford of 
the Potomac in pursuit of Lee's retreating 
army. Here first the regiment sharply en- 
gaged the enemy. This was a serious afifair, 
and Colonel Chamberlain bore a conspicuous 
part, being especially complimented for his 
courage and coolness in steadying the troops 
of the brigade through the treacherous ford 
and under heavy fire in the repulse which 
followed the overwhelming attack of Lee's 
rear guard of Hill's Corps. The regiment 
was held on the Antietam battle-field for more 
than six weeks, guarding the fords of the 
upper Potomac. This led to new experiences 
— especially in the line of reconnaissance and 
outpost duty, in all of which Colonel Cham- 
berlain took an active part. This encampment 
on the Antietam, owing to the exhalations and 
drainage from the battle-field, brought dire 
disease upon the men, more than three hun- 
dred being in the hospital with typhoid ma- 
larial fever, and severe losses befalling the 
regiment both among officers and men. This 
opened a new field for duties of superior and 
commanding officers — study and practice in 
the care of men. 



Early in November the regiment rejoined 
the main army near Warrenton Junction, Vir- 
ginia, and from that time actively participated 
in all the movements, skirmishes and camp- 
making, until the battle of Fredericksburg,. 
December 13. Here Colonel Chamberlain had 
experiences of the most severe and testing 
kind, the closing of which was the withdraw- 
ing of his regiment from the advance front 
line, by night, across the whole depth of the 
battle-field, and over the last pontoon bridge 
left for the recrossing of our discomfited army. 
He had an active part in all the movements of 
that winter, including the notorious "Mud 
March" and its sequel. During this winter 
he devoted himself assiduously to the study 
of his duties, having the advantage of the cir- 
cumstance that all his superiors in command 
and many of his own rank were graduates of 
West Point. He induced the younger of them 
to hold an evening "school of review" in which 
all the points pertaining to active duties in the 
field were carefully gone over. There was 
no better scholar than Colonel Chamberlain. 

At the opening of the Chancellorsville cam- 
paign, the regiment having been inoculated 
with smallpox by some misconduct in the 
medical department, and being sequestered 
and put into a quarantine camp by itself. Col- 
onel Ames, having been detached as aide on 
the staff of the corps commander. General 
Meade, left the regiment so situated in com- 
mand of Colonel Chamberlain. He immedi- 
ately rode to general headquarters and begged 
to have his regiment given some place at the 
front, his final plea being "if we can't do any- 
thing else, we can give the rebels the small- 
pox !" This struck the fancy of General 
Hooker, and at midnight he received a dis- 
patch from General Rutterfield. chief of staff, 
directing him to be at Banks's and United 
States fords at daylight to take charge of the 
signal and telegraph lines from headquarters 
to the several stations on the field of battle, 
with instructions to put to death any who 
attempted to disturb communications. While 
in discharge of duty on the following day he 
took occasion to join in a charge then being 
made by his Division, in which his horse was 
wounded under him. On the night of the 
withdrawal he worked on the pontoon bridges 
which were broken up by the freshet, and 
after all our troops had left that vicinity he 
withdrew his command — the last on the 
ground. From this time on his history is part 
of that of the Army of the Potomac. The 
mere outline of it would exceed the limits al- 
lotted here. His inherited military aptitude,

strengthened hy early studies, now finding 
ample scope in canipaii^rnint; of tlie severe t or- 
der, brouglit him distinction and rapid pro- 
motion in command. On May 20 he was pro- 
moted colonel, and soon afterward a hundred 
and twenty men of the Second Maine Volun- 
teers were transferred to his regiment. They 
were in a state of mutiny, owing to their not 
being discharged with the original two-years 
men, and as they had openly refused to obey 
orders they were sent to Colonel Chamber- 
lain under guard of a Pennsylvania regiment 
with loaded arms and fixed bayonets, with 
orders from the corps commander to fire on 
them if they refused to do duty. Colonel 
Chamberlain immediately rode to General 
Meade and got permission to manage the men 
in his own way. He then took off all the 
guard, supplied them with proper clothing and 
food (which had not been issued to them for 
three days), and assigned them to companies, 
without giving them any specific orders what- 
ever, expecting them to be treated and behave 
like other soldiers. He found no trouble ex- 
cept in the case of one or two who were tried 
by court martial, and whose sentences he 
afterwards succeeded in having remitted. 
These men of the Second Regiment were af- 
terwards among his very best. At Gettysburg 
he was sent at the double-quick to a position 
of great importance and peril. Little Round 
Top, the extreme left of the Union lines, 
where for more than tw^o hours he withstood 
the repeated assaults of Law's brigade of 
Hood's division. His ammunition at length 
exhausted, and for the last half-hour using 
that of the rebel dead and w-ounded on the 
slope he had swept repelling the third assault, 
nearly half his men having fallen, the situa- 
tion w-as critical. A heavy force now coming 
on with confidence of crushing his little com- 
mand, he met with a bayonet charge, himself 
with the colors leading, which completely 
cleared the southern slope of Little Round 
Top, capturing four hundred prisoners — twice 
the number of his men. Returning to his ap- 
pointed position, in front of which lay one 
hundred and fifty of the enemy's dead and 
wounded, he made dispositions with some re- 
inforcements for meeting any night assault. 
At dark he received an intimntion from his 
' rigade commander that it was desirable to 
secure the heights of Great Round Top, up 
whose rugged slope the troops he had repulsed 
had taken refuge. At once he called his 
vyearied but heroic men, and with no ammuni- 
tion, with the bayonet alone, in the dense dark- 
ness pressed on to the very crest of the moun- 



tain, ca[)turing many more prisoners. Thus 
that decisive ])art of the field was secured and 
held, and Lee's plan of battle changed. For 
this heroic conduct the Twentieth Maine re- 
ceived the personal and official recognition of 
brigade, division and corps commanders, and 
Colonel Chnmberlain was warmly recom- 
mended bv all his superiors for promotion to 
the rank of brigadier-general. His action here 
was recognized by the award of the Congres- 
sional Medal of Honor, the grounds of this 
as officially stated : "For daring heroism and 
great tenacity in holding his position on Little 
Round Top, and carrying the advanced posi- 
tion on the Great Round Top, in the battle of 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 2, 1863." The 
promotion was not made; but Colonel Cham- 
berlain was immediately placed in command 
of his brigade, his division commander, Gen- 
eral Grififin, declining to receive general ofificers 
who were sent for assignment to this brigade. 
This he devoted himself to bring to the best 
proficiency. He took an important part in 
the Culpeper and Centerville campaigns, in- 
cluding the battle of Rappahannock Station, in 
which his horse was shot under him. In No- 
vember. 1863, being worn by long and arduous 
duty, the exposure of lying out in a heavy 
snow storm one night without shelter or suffi- 
cient covering, brought -upon him a severe 
attack of congestion and fever chills, and he 
was sent in an almost unconscious state from 
Rappahannock to Washington, by the only 
means of conveyance, a returning cattle car. 
After this crisis, as soon as he was able to 
be out, he made strenuous efforts to return 
to his command ; but was detailed by the Sec- 
retary of War to serve on an important court 
martial sitting in Washington and afterwards 
in Trenton, New Jersey, where he was for 
some time detained. He obtained a release 
with much difficulty, and when the army 
crossed tlie Rapidan in May he o\ertook it 
near Spottsylvania, and finding his brigade in 
command of another, General Bartlett, he re- 
joined his regiment. In less than an hour he 
was placed in command of a "forlorn hope." 
Seven select regiments were led by him to a 
desperate charge by night on a portion of a 
position that had proved impregnable during 
the day. In this he showed great skill and 
achieved a remarkable success. From this 
time forth he held a command above his lineal 
rank and was put in positions of responsibility 
and severe tests. He had a conspicuous part 
in the battles of Cold Harbor and the North 
Anna. On June ist, 186.4, General Warren, 
commanding the corps, made up a splendid

brigade of two consolidated brigades from 
the old First Corps, and a fine new regiment 
of veterans of Pennsylvania, and assigned 
Colonel Chamberlain to command it. This 
took him quite away from his gallant old 
Twentieth Maine, whose fortunes he had 
shared in every battle except the Wilderness. 
With this veteran brigade he continued the 
campaign, crossing the James river, and on 
June 17th moved on Petersburg in advance. 
On the morning of June i8th he carried a 
strong advanced position of the enemy a mile 
beyond our main army. In order to hold this, 
he' established two batteries of artillery on the 
crest, and entrenched his lines. He was ex- 
pecting an attack here, when he received a 
verbal order through an unknown staff officer 
to assault the main line of rebel works at 
Rives's salient, then strongly manned with 
artillery and infantry, all within musket range 
of the crest he was holding. Forming his six 
regiments in double lines, he ordered a strong 
artillery fire from his gams on the crest, and 
under this he led the charge with his whole 
staff, when the terrible fire of the enemy, case- 
shot, canister and furious musketry, swept 
every one from his side, his flag-bearer was 
killed, his own horse shot under him, and his 
front line shattered. Lifting up his fallen 
flag, he led his troops almost to the enemy's 
entrenchments. At a desperate moment, 
wheeling to give a command, Colonel Cham- 
berlain was shot through the body from hip to 
hip, severing small arteries and fracturing the 
pelvic bones. Balancing himself with the point 
of his sabre, he managed not to fall until his 
men had passed him in their charge, when 
the great loss of blood brought him to the 
ground. Believing the wound to be mortal, he 
refused to be taken from the field, until all was 
fairly lost. There was no hope of his life, and 
an obituary notice was sent to the northern pa- 
pers. He was, however, carried sixteen miles 
on a stretcher and sent to Annapolis Naval 
School Hospital. General Grant, without wait- 
ing longer for the authorities to act upon previ- 
ous recommendations, promoted Colonel Cham- 
berlain on the field, to the rank of brigadier- 
general, the solitary instance in the history of 
our army. He was assured of his promotion 
before he was borne from the field, but the 
official order published to the army reached 
him after his arrival at Annapolis. The fol- 
lowing is a copy of the order : 

Headquarters Army of the U. S.. 
Special Order No. 39. June 20. 18G4. 

Col J L. Chamberlain, 20th Me. Infty Vols., for 
meritorious and efficient services on the field of battle, 
and especially for gallant conduct in leading his brigade 
against the enemy at Petersburg on the ISth Inst.. In 
which he was dangerously wounded, hereby, la pursu- 



ance of authority of the Secretary of War. is appointed 
Brigadier General U. S. Volunteers, to rank as such 
from the 18th day of June, 1864, subject to the approval 
of the President. 

U. S. Grant, Lieutenant General. 

For two months General Chamberlain lay 
at .A.nnapolis at the point of death, and at the 
end of five months, and before he could mount 
a horse or walk a hundred yards, he resumed 
command of his brigade. Its position at that 
time was on the extreme left of our front line 
before Petersburg, and the duties were unre- 
mitting and responsible. In the subsequent 
operations against the Weldon railroad. Gen- 
eral Chamberlain had an active part, being 
sent with his command to make proper dispo- 
sitions by night and to keep the enemy at 
bay along an extensive front, while the rest of 
our troops destroyed the railroad. A 
severe snow storm and sleet added to 
the severities of the operation, and on 
the last of January, 1865, his wounds 
had become so aggravated that his corps 
commander insisted on his being sent 
to Philadelphia for surgical treatment. While 
suffering under this, and without much pros- 
pect of permanent recovery, he received many 
tempting offers to leave the military service 
and accept positions in civil life. Wishing, 
however, with such strength as might be given 
him, to stand by his men and his country to 
the last, he declined these offers, stole a march 
upon his surgeons, and leaving his room for 
the first time after he had taken it, started on 
a painful journey to the front again, where he 
arrived after an absence of a month. His 
brigade now consisted of new regiments of 
veteran troops from New York and Pennsyl- 
vania, and his post was the extreme advance 
on Hatcher's Run, and in immediate contact 
with the enemy. On March 29 our great 
offensive movement commenced, and, as had 
before been confidentially announced to Gen- 
eral Chamberlain, he was to have the costly 
honor of leading the advance and opening the 
campaign. With his single brigade and a 
battery of regular artillery, he encountered 
the eiiemv onQuaker Road, their force con- 
sisting of cavalry and infantry of Johnson's 
and Anderson's commands, and in number, 
as was afterwards ascertained, five times his 
own. After a long and severe battle in which 
at different times he had both his flanks 
turned, his center broken, and lost four hun- 
dred men and eighteen officers — every one of 
his mounted officers, including his personal 
staff, being either killed or wounded, his own 
horse shot under him and himself twice pain- 
fully wounded in the breast and arm — the en- 
emy was driven from his position, which en-

ahled the army to occupy tlic long coveted 
Roydton plaiiU mad. For conspicuous gal- 
lantry in the action of this day General Cham- 
berlain received from President Lincoln the 
brevet of major-peneral. Suffering from ac- 
cumulation of wounds, he was suddenly sum- 
moned on the second day after, to take com- 
mand of our extreme left on the Boydton road, 
with two hrigades and two batteries of artil- 
lery to repel an attack which was then begin- 
ning. Two divisions of his corps on his right 
were soon thrown back in great confusion 
from an advanced position they were endeav- 
oring to maintain against a vigorous assault 
of the enemy, and while General Chamberlain 
was rallying these troops and reforming them 
in the rear of his own, he was asked by the 
commanding general to throw forward his 
command and attempt to stem the torrent then 
sweeping the front, and if possible regain the 
field lost by the other two divisions. General 
Chamberlain assented, and while the engineers 
were trying to bridge the stream in our front. 
he and his men dashed through it in the very 
face of the enemy, and gaining a foothold on 
the opposite steeps, drove the rebels back to 
the field of the former struggle. While press- 
ing them back upon their works. General 
Chamberlain was ordered to halt and take the 
defensive as a matter of precaution. Seeing, 
however, that his men were much exposed, 
and that the enemy's strong position could be 
carried by a tactful maneuver, he solicited per- 
mission to make an assault, which he did with 
rapid and complete success, carrying the 
works, capturing a battle flag and many pris- 
oners, and effecting a lodgement on the White 
Oak road. At the battle of Five Forks on the 
following day, General Chamberlain had com- 
mand of two brigades on the extreme right— 
the wheeling flank. In the midst of the battle, 
when the rebels made a furious attempt to 
regain their works by a flank attack, putting 
in everv man of his own command and a mass 
of skulkers and fugitives from other com- 
mands on a new direction to break the force 
of this onset, he led the charge, leaping his 
horse over the parapet, already wounded by 
a rifle ball. His command captured 1050 men, 
nineteen officers and five battle flags — one half 
the captures of the division. On the next day 
he was ordered to take the advance and strike 
the South Side railroad. Here he encountered 
Fitz Hugh Lee's division of cavalry, which 
he drove across the railroad, intercepting a 
train of cars from Petersburg with several 
military and civil officers, and routing the 
enemy from the position. In the subsequent 



pursuit, General Chamberlain had the advance 
nearly all the time, capturing many prisoners 
and vast quantities of material. At Jeters- 
ville, on the Danville railroad, he went to the 
assistance of our cavalry which was severely 
attacked on a cross road. In the final action 
at Appomattox Court House, when, having 
marched all night, he came up with our cav- 
alry, which was heroically holding its ground 
against Stonewall Jackson's old corps of in- 
fantry, he double-quicked his men in to re- 
lieve the cavalry, and forming under General 
Sheridan's eye, pushed forward against the 
enemy. The other troops forming on his left, 
the foe was driven before them to the town, 
when the flag of truce came in and hostilities 
ceased. General Chamberlain was present at 
the conference preliminary to the surrender, 
and being assigned to his old command — the 
Third Brigade, First Division — was appointed 
by the commanding general to receive with 
his troops the formal surrender of the arms 
and colors of Lee's army, April 12, 1865. Im- 
mediately afterwards, assigned to the com- 
mand of division, General Chamberlain occu- 
pied a line twenty-five miles out from Peters- 
burg on the South Side railroad for some 
time. This division had the advance in the 
triumphal entry of the army into Richmond, 
as also the advance of the Army of the Po- 
tomac in the final review in Washington. 
When the army was broken up he received an 
assignment to another command intended to 
go to Mexico, but the active operations of the 
field now being over, he applied to be relieved 
from duty that he might have the surgical 
treatment which his wounds required, and 
was mustered out of service January 16, 1866. 
In the arduous and trying campaigns 
through which he passed, General Chamber- 
Iain made a record honorable to himself and 
to the state. During his period of service he 
commanded troops in tw-enty-four battles, 
eight reconnaissances, skirmishes without num- 
ber, and with advance and rear guards in con- 
tact with the enemy upwards of a dozen times. 
With his own command alone he fought sev- 
eral independent engagements, every one of 
which was successful against superior num- 
bers. His captures in battle number 2,700 
prisoners and eight battle flags, no portion of 
which can be claimed by any other command. 
He was six times struck in action by shot and 
shell, three times narrowly escaping with his 
life. Immediately after the surrender of the 
rebel army, General Chamberlain was made 
the subject of special communication to head- 
quarters of the army by Major General Grif- 



138 



STATE OF MAINE. 



fin. his corps commander, in wliich this officer 
urged General Chamberlain's promotion to the 
full rank of major-general, for distinguished 
and gallant conduct in the battles on the left, 
including the White Oak Road, Five Forks 
and Appomattox Court House, where, says 
General Griffin, "his bravery and efficiency 
were such as to entitle him to the highest 
commendation. In the last action, April 9, his 
command had the advance, and was driving 
the enemy rapidly before it, when the an- 
nouncement of General Lee's surrender was 
made." The recommendation was cordially 
approved by General Meade and General 
Grant, and forwarded to Washington for the 
action of the government, where assurances 
were given that the promotion should be made. 
General Chamberlain was rarely absent from 
field of duty. He had but four days' leave of 
absence. At all other times when not in the 
field, he had been either ordered away for 
treatment of wounds, or president of a court- 
martial by order of the War Department. But 
no part of his record reflects greater satisfac- 
tion than his relations with the men under his 
command. He made it a point of duty and 
of affection to take care of his men. He never 
ordered troops into positions that he had not 
first personally reconnoitered, and though his 
losses in killed and wounded have been severe, 
they were never made in retreating. The 
noble and faithful men entrusted to his care 
never in a single instance failed to execute 
his orders or to carry out what they deemed 
to be his wishes, although unexpressed. In 
all the various fortunes of the field he never 
left one of his wounded in the lines of the 
enemy nor one of his dead without fitting 
burial. 

On returning to his native state and the 
paths of peace. General Chamberlain quietly 
resumed his professorship in Bowdoin Col- 
lege. He was not long allowed to remain 
there, however. In recognition of his dis- 
tinguished service and ability, he was elected 
governor of the state, by the largest majority 
ever given for that office. He was re-elected 
the three following years and left the guber- 
natorial office with an enviable record. His 
administration marked an epoch in the ma- 
terial advance of the state. Soon after leav- 
ing the office of governor in 1871, he was 
elected president of Bowdoin College and dis- 
charged the duties of that office for twelve 
years. He resigned in 1883, but continued 
his lectures on political economy until 1885. 
He was professor of mental and moral phi- 
losophy from 1874 to 1879. In 1876 he was 



commissioned major-general of state militia, 
and was in command at the cipitol during 
the political troubles in January, 1880, when 
his determined stand against minatory move- 
ments ended the opposition of a turbulent fac- 
tion which threatened civil war. In 1878 he 
was appointed commissioner to the Universal 
Exposition at Paris, France. For his service 
here he received a medal of honor from the 
French government. In the following year 
the United States government published his 
report on the Exposition, embracing the sub- 
ject of education in Europe. This received 
remarkable commendation from all quarters. 
In 1867 Governor Chamberlain received the 
honorary degree of LL.D. from Bowdoin 
College, having already received the same 
from Pennsylvania College in 1866. During 
the years 1884 and 1889 he was engaged in 
railroad construction and industrial enter- 
prises in Florida. In 1900 he was appointed 
by President McKinley surveyor of the port 
of Portland, and has since filled that position. 
As a writer, lecturer and orator. Governor 
Chamberlain has no superior in the state. He 
has given numerous lectures and public ad- 
dresses, with a wide range of topics. In 1876 
he delivered at the Centennial Exposition at 
Philadelphia an elaborate public address en- 
titled "Maine ; her place in History." On in- 
vitation this was repeated before the Legisla- 
ture of Maine in 1877, and afterward pub- 
lished by the state and given wide circulation. 
He wrote a remarkable series of papers on the 
Spanish war, and has since given valuable ad- 
dresses on historic places and events in Maine, 
and many tributes to historic personages, the 
last being one on Lincoln Memorial Day in 
Philadelphia, which is considered remarkable 
for its truthfulness and eloquence. He has 
held many offices of honor, among them that 
of president of the Webster Historical Society, 
vice-president of the American Huguenot So- 
ciety, president of the Society of the Army of 
the Potomac, commander of the Military 
Order of the Loyal Legion of the United 
States, and commander of the Grand Army 
of the Republic in the state of Maine. He is 
now president of the Chamberlain Association 
of America, and of the Maine Branch of the 
National Red Cross. He is also an active 
member of many literary and scientific so- 
cieties. 

The home of General Chamberlain is in 
Brunswick and amidst the classic shadows of 
Bowdoin College. It is a historic spot, and 
was formerly known as the old Fales house 
built by Captain Pierce in 1820. By others it 



STATE OF MAIN']'.. 



139 



has been called the lon.ufcllcw house, as it 
was here that the jioet brought his youu^ bride 
in 1830, and for some time he made his home. 
Fales was the second owner of the place, and 
it was during his occupancy that the Long- 
fellow occupation occurred. At that time he 
was professor of modern languages in Bow- 
doin, and in after years he was often heard to 
say that those were the happiest years of his 
life. The property finally passed into the pos- 
session of Rev. Dr. Roswell D. Hitchcock, and 
was purchased from him by General Cham- 
berlain in 1861. At that time the present 
owner was the professor of modern languages 
in Bowdoin and his financial ability was by 
no means equal to his good name and high 
standing in the community as a man of honor. 
For this reason the president of the principal 
local bank came to him and assured him that 
he could have all the money he wanted, to 
conclude the purchase. In this manner the 
old house passed into the hands of the young 
college professor and has since been one of the 
most charming homes in Maine. 

On returning to Brunswick after the civil 
war, with the stars of a major-general on his 
shoulders, and being soon governor, he found 
the old house would hardly hold his visitors. 
It was enlarged by simply raising it and 
putting another story beneath it. Thus the 
original house remained intact, only it was one 
story higher, while the lower portion was 
built more up to date. It is now a very spa- 
cious mansion, containing no less than twenty 
full-sized rooms. 

It is doubtful if there is another house in 
all IVIaine beneatli w-hose roof so many dis- 
tinguished guests have been entertained. Gen- 
erals Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, McClellan, 
Porter, Warren, Ayers, Griffin and Howard 
have all partaken of its hospitality. Its walls 
have echoed the brilliant conversation of 
Sumner, Wilson. Schurtz, Evans, Fessenden, 
Bradbury. Morrill I'Yye, Hale and Blaine, 
and others famous in our national history. 
Hosts of literary rnen have been its guests. 
It was here that Longfellow came in 1875 
when he delivered his famous "Morituri 
Salutamus," and while here he occupied the 
same rooms that had been his in earlier days. 
The old poet was afifected to tears as the flood 
of tender recollections came sweeping over 
him. This home is filled with antique furni- 
ture, much of which is connected with prom- 
inent persons of the past, rare and valuable 
paintings and statuary, and relics of the civil 
war, far too numerous to be paticularized 
here. On the wall of his favorite office is a 



tapestry picture of the General's old war 
horse, Charlemagne, that carried him through 
nearly all of his battles in the civil war. Three 
times lie was shot down, but, like his master, 
rallied and went on. Once on a headlong 
charge a bullet aimed afclose range square at 
the general's heart was caught by his horse's 
neck and then struck the General a glancing 
blow in the left breast, inflicting a severe 
wound, but leaving him his life. At the close 
of the war the horse was brought home to 
Brunswick, where for many years he was the 
playmate of the children and pet of the fam- 
ily.' On his death the faithful animal was 
given an honorable burial at the General's sea- 
side cottage, "Domhegan," in Brunswick, and 
an inscriiition cut in the rock above his grave, 
which is kept with loyal care. 

The library and study are two interesting 
rooms in the old mansion. Here are more 
than two thousand volumes of well chosen 
books, and by the cozy open fire the old war- 
rior reads and meditates. There are many 
valuable trophies of war in this room as well 
as objects of literary and historic interest. 
Connected is a small "den" containing more 
books, and on the wall hangs a rebel battle 
flag captured by General Chamberlain in a 
racing charge just before Appomattox. Just 
above this flag is a huge cavalry pistol with 
a history. In the famous charge on Little 
Round 'Fop, General Chamberlain was met by 
a rebel officer with sword and pistol in hand. 
One barrel was discharged full at the Gen- 
eral's head. Although but ten feet away, the 
bullet missed its -mark. The officer, who be- 
longed to the Fifteenth Alabama Regiment, 
then rushed at the Union leader with his 
sword. General Chamberlain met him, and, 
being the more expert swordsman, soon had 
him at his mercy. Seeing that the case was 
hopeless, the confederate officer surrendered 
both sword and pistol to Chamberlain and 
gave himself up as prisoner. Many other war 
relics are here. The cap and sword of Gen- 
eral Griffin, who commanded the Fifth Corps, 
are in this room. At the battle of Five Forks, 
General Griffin lost his sword, and General 
Chamberlain instantly rode to his side and 
offered him his, which was accepted and used 
during the remainder of the w-ar. General 
Chamberlain quickly replaced his weapon by 
taking the sword of a fallen South Caro- 
lina officer, which he wore until the close 
of the war. Several years later General 
Chamberlain received his own sword and 
the division flag from the War Depart- 
ment at Washington. General Griffin's cap

and the division bugle which had sounded all 
the battle calls of the war were sent at the 
same time to the Brunswick hero who had 
last commanded that splendid division. 

In the main library the great flag of the 
division hangs from riie ceiling, while on one 
wall is the last flag surrendered by Lee on the 
field of Appomattox. The personal flag of 
General Chamberlain, bearing the red maltese 
cross, is also here, dimmed by battle smoke 
and torn by shell and bullet. A precious me- 
mento is this, and even dearer to its owner 
than the bust of Grant, by Simmons, that 
stands close by. Over the fireplace in this 
library are the stars of the first flag of the old 
Twentieth Maine regiment, first commanded 
by General Ames and then by Chamberlain. 
Here, also, serving as a match box, is the 
base of a shell that burst at the General's feet 
in the battle of Gettysburg. It was a conical 
shell and it shows that when it exploded five 
pieces flew ofif into the faces of Chamber- 
lain's men. In an adjoining closet is the coat 
that General Chamberlain wore when he was 
shot through the body in front of Petersburg 
and promoted by Grant. Another coat bear- 
ing the stars of a general has the left breast 
and left sleeve torn and shredded by shot or 
shell at the battle on Quaker road in the final 
campaign of the war. 

General Chamberlain married, in Bruns- 
wick, December 7, 1855, Frances Caroline 
Adams, who was bom in Boston, Massachu- 
setts, August 12, 1826. and died in Bruns- 
wick, Maine, October 18, iQO.v She was the 
daughter of Ashur Adams and Amelia Wyllys 
Adams, of Boston, and was a lineal descen- 
dant of Mabel Harlakenden, the "Princess of 
New England." The children of this mar- 
riage are Grace Dupee and Harold Wyllys. 
Grace Dupee was born in Brunswick, October 
16, 1856, and married April 28, 1881, Horace 
Gwynne Allen, who is a distinguished lawyer 
in Boston. The children are : 

I. Eleanor Wyllys, born in Boston, Decem- 
ber 13, 1893; Beatrice Lawrence, January 24. 
i8g6: and Rosamund, December 25, 1898. 2. 
Harold Wyllys Chamberlain, born in Bruns- 
wick, October 10, 1858, and graduated at Bovv- 
doin College in 1881 ; studied law in Boston 
University, and successfully practiced in Flor- 
ida for four years. 

He has since interested himself in elec- 
trical engineering and has invented val- 
uable improvements in that line, which he is 
now applying in practical work in the city of 
Portland. 



When our heathen ancestors 
JENNINGS adopted the christian faith 

they assumed christian names 
as evidences of their conversion. On account 
of the prominence in the early church of St. 
John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, 
the name lohanan or lohannes, afterward 
shortened to Ian, lohn, or John, became a 
favorite. When the Saxon sufiix ing, signify- 
ing son, was added, it gave the patronymic 
laning, or Janing, that is, John's son, which 
finally became Jennings, which form has pre- 
vailed for many centuries, thoug'.i its orthog- 
raphy shows more than thirty variations in the 
early records of Massachusetts. The men of 
this race have usually been tall, strong, hardy 
and energetic, have taken an active part in the 
wars of New England and the Republic, and 
have been successfully engaged in many of 
the pursuits of peace. Fifty-five were patriot 
soldiers in the revolutionary war from Massa- 
chusetts. One of the first two Englishmen 
who ever descended Lake Champlain was a 
Jennings. A colonial governor of New Jer- 
sey, the first governor of Indiana, a governor 
of Florida, and other men of prominence have 
borne this patronymic. Several of the name 
settled in Massachusetts in very early times ; 
but who was the immigrant ancestor of this 
family, or when or where he settled in New 
England, is not within the knowledge of the 
present generation. Freeman, the historian of 
Cape Cod, says : "It is impossible after much 
investigation, to give so satisfactory account 
as we would wish, of the Jennings family.'' 
Their earliest history probably perished with 
the early town records which contained it. 
Freeman adds : "The Jennings family, long 
time prominent and highly respectable in this 
town ( Sandwich ) have become extinct here ; 
but lands are still called after their name.'' 

(I) John Jennings, the first of the family 
of whom there is authentic information, was 
living at Sandwich in 1667, and died there 
June 18, 1722, "at an advanced age." On 
"23, 2 month, 1675," John Jennings was 
among the sixty-nine residents of Sandvyich" 
who were able to make it appear that they had 
just rights and title to the privileges of the 
town." July 4, 1678, the name of John Jen- 
nings was not on "the list of those who have 
taken the oath of fidelity." August 18, 1681, 
the town voted John Jennings and two others 
"All the bog meadow, leaving out the springs 
for the neighborhood," near Dexter's Island. 
June 25, 1702, the name of John Jennings ap- 
pears on the "record of inhabitants of the town 



STATE OF MAINE. 



141 



of Sandwich (.inilkd l<i ilieir share in the divi- 
sion of lands as \kv vote of March 24, 1702." 
July i6, 1708, John Jennings, cordwainer, was 
appointed administrator "on all and singular 
the goods and chattels, rights and credits of 
John Jennings your son some time of Sand- 
wich aforesaid, mariner, who it is said died 
intestate." This John, born "3, 12, 1673," is 
said to have been a captain in the English 
merchant service, and to have died in foreign 
parts. May 15, i6yo, John Jennings and Sam- 
uel Prince were elected constables. The con- 
stable at that time was a person of some im- 
portance, as he was the town's financial rep- 
resentative, being tax collector and treasurer. 
John Jennings held various minor town offices 
and seems to have been occasionally paid 
money by the town for various services. The 
fact that John Jennings was a witness to the 
wills of two Quakers, Lydia Gaunt, 1691, ami 
Isaac Gaunt, i6g8, and the further fact that 
the inventory of his estate shows that he had 
at the time of his death "Quakers' books as 
we suppose may be valued by that people two 
pounds," make it seem that he was undoubt- 
edly one of those just men whose influence 
prevented any harm ever coming to the 
Quakers of "the Cape," though they were 
cruelly persecuted in some other parts of New 
England. John Jennings died intestate and his 
son Isaac administered his estate, the inven- 
tory of which amounted to forty-five pounds 
fifteen shillings six pence. He seeins to have 
been an honest and honorable inan who minded 
his own business and was sometimes called in 
to help other people with theirs. John Jen- 
nings married (first) June 29, 1667, Susanna; 
(second) Ruhamah ; the surname of neither be- 
ing now known. His children by Susanna 
were: Remember (or Remembrance) and 
Ann; and by Ruhamah: John, Isaac, Eliza- 
beth (died young), Elizabeth and Samuel. 
These children, as shown by the Sandwich 
records, were born between September 17, 
1668, and February 28, 1685. 

(II) Samuel, youngest child of John and 
Ruhamah Jennings, was born in Sandwich, 
February 19, 1684-85 (O. S.), and died there 
May 13, 1764, in the eightieth year of his age. 
He was impressed into the British navy, and 
in escaping from it had the adventure which 
he narrates in a letter to his pastor. Rev. Dr. 
Stillman, which was printed and published 
with the following ".Advertisement" : "The 
writer of the following Letter was a person 
of good understanding, of great sobriety and 
uprightness, and sustained a very fair charac- 
ter to his death, which was in the year seven- 



teen hundred and sixty-four, in advanced age. 
He ixire on his body the marks of the terrible 
assault herein related ; the particulars of which 
he often repeated, and the following letter was 
found among his papers anil is published by 
his son to perpetuate a remembrance of this 
signal Providence." The letter is as follows : 
"Honored Sir : .According to your request, 
when I was at your house above a year ago, I 
have now taken in hand to give you an ac- 
count of that disaster which befel me in the 
West Indies, which was after the following 
manner. It was in the year 1703, I think in 
the month of (Jctobcr, that I was impressed 
on board a frigate, in Carlisle Bay, called the 
Alilford, which was a station ship for the Is- 
land of Barbados; and after about four or 
five months continuance on board said ship, I 
became exceedingly restless about my way of 
living ; and I shajl give you some of the rea- 
sons that made me so. And first, I observed 
that many times when men were sick of fevers 
and other distempers, they were beaten to 
work, when men that were drunk were easily 
excused, though they were commonly a third 
of our number when there was work to do. 
And one time, being sick myself of a fever so 
that my legs would scarce carry me without 
help of my hands, I was commanded up to 
work ; I told the officer I was sick and could 
not work ; he said I lied, and thereupon drove 
me, with several others in the same condition, 
upon deck (some of whom died the next day), 
then I went to the captain and told him that I, 
with some others, were beaten to work, though 
we were sick and not able to work : He said 
we were rascals, and the doctor said we were 
not sick ; whereupon we were forced to stay 
on deck some time, and had now and then a 
blow, but did not and could not work. Sec- 
ondly, I observed that industry and idleness 
were equally rewarded with blows ; for they 
would begin at one end of a parcel of men 
pulling at a rope, and whip till they came to 
the other end, without minding who pulls and 
who does not. And thirdly, I found that my 
continuance in such a wicked family had 
brought me to smack of their familiar sin, viz., 
swearing, though I was but very awkward at 
it, and my conscience would always menace 
me for it. And I found also that the desire 
of strong drink had gained somewhat upon 
me, though I was not drunk with it at all. and 
had totally left the use of strong drink before 
I left the ship. Now the consideration of 
these and some other difficulties which I found 
in this place I lay obnoxious to, made me un- 
dertake that dangerous way of escape by

swimming ; for I considered the danger before 
I set out ; but on the 26th day of .March, 1704, 
I had drawn up a resolution that I would rid 
myself of this company, or lose my life when 
night came. I found it something difficult to 
get away undiscovered, there being centinels 
afore and abaft, with muskets loaded to shoot 
any one that should attempt to run away, and 
likewise a guard boat to row round the ship all 
night. I watched them till about ten o'clock 
at night, at which time, finding the centinels 
pretty careless, and the guard boat ahead of 
the ship, I went dov\n between decks, and hav- 
ing begged of God to carry me through that 
dangerous enterprize and deliver me out of 
those distresses, I w^ent out of a port and 
swam with my .shirt and breeches on right out 
to sea, before the wind, till I was clear of the 
ship and guard boat, and then turned along- 
shore awhile, and then wheeled more towards 
the shore, but the seas beat over my head so 
fast I could hardly swim, and I thought beat 
me more out to sea, whereupon I turned and 
swam right against the wind towards the 
shore, and after a considerable time got to one 
of Captain Gillam's buoys, and rested myself 
awhile, and if I had known the ship I would 
have gone on board, but I aimed to swim to a 
brigantine that lay in the road belonging to 
Boston. Then I put of? from Captain Gillam's 
buov, and had not swam far before I saw a 
Shark just as he took hold of my left hand, he 
pulled me under water in a moment, at which 
I was very much surprised, and thought of a 
knife which I used to carry in my pocket, but 
• remembered I had left it on board ; then I 
kicked him several times with my right foot, 
but that proving ineffectual, I set my foot 
against his mouth, intending to haul my hai,(, 
away or haul it off, and then he opened his 
mouth a little and catch'd part of my foot into 
his mouth with my hand, and held them both 
together. Then I cried unto God (mentally) 
that he woidd have mercy on my soul, whicii 
I thought would soon be separated from my 
tody ; but still I did not leave off striving, but 
punched him with my right hand, though to 
very little purpose ; at last being almost 
drowned (for I was all the while under wa- 
ter) I had almost left off striving, and ex- 
pecting nothing but present death ; all at once 
my hand came loose and also my foot, and so 
finding myself clear of the fish I got to the top 
of the water, and having a little cleared my 
stomach of water, I called out for help, and 
swam towards the nearest ship, and I quickly 
heard them mustering to fit out their boat, 
which encouraged me to continue my calling 



for help, thinking tliereby they might find me 
the sooner, it being very dark ; they came to 
me with all speed and took me into their boat, 
and carried me to the ship's side, where I saw 
they had a lanthorn, but the blood turning just 
at that time, caused me to be extreme sick at 
my stomach, and my sight also left me, but I 
answered Captain Gillam to many questions 
while I was blind ; then they fastened a rope 
about me and hauled me into the ship and 
carried me into the steerage, and after a while 
recovering my sight, I asked if there was any 
doctor on board, they said yes, and pointed to 
Mr. Peter Cutler of Boston, he then being 
Captain Gillam's doctor. I asked him to cut 
off my mangled limbs if he saw it needful, and 
he spoke to the captain about it, but he would 
not allow of it, but sent advice to the Milford 
of what had happened, and the lieutenant sent 
a boat and carried me on board again, and the 
doctor being ashore, he sent for doctor Cutler 
and another doctor, who came on board, and 
after a glass of wine they ordered I should be 
tied, but upon my earnest solicitation they for- 
bore to tie me, and then doctor Cutler per- 
formed the first amputation, wdiich was my 
arm, and the other doctor cut off part of my 
foot. I endured extreme pain all the while, 
and after they had dressed those two wounds, 
they dressed three other flesh wounds, which 
I received at the same time, and the next day 
I was carried on shore, where I remained 
without appetite, and so full of pain, that I 
thought I did not sleep three hours in three 
weeks : but at last thro' God's great goodness, 
the pain left me and my appetite was restored, 
and my wounds healed wonderful fast, so that 
in about four months my foot was healed up, 
and I could go on it ; but it broke out again, 
and I could not thoroughly heal it till I got 
home to New England. I was about nineteen 
years of age at the time of this disaster. I 
received much kindness from many gentlemen 
belonging to New England, as well as from 
those of Barbados, under those difficulties, all 
which I desire gratefully to acknowledge. But 
above all. I would acknowledge the great good- 
ness of that God that supported me under and 
carried me through those distresses, and has 
provided for me ever since, so that neither I, 
nor mine, have wanted the necessary comforts 
of this life, notwithstanding my inability of 
body for many employments. Thus having 
run through the most observable passages of 
that disaster, I shall conclude, desiring your 
prayers to God for me, that so signal a de- 
liverance may not be lost upon me ; and that I 
may, by believing and yielding obedience to the

/vfter his relnrii from Barbadoes, Samuel 
Jeuniiigs probably ilevotecl himself to the ac- 
quisition of a superior education in conse- 
quence of his being maimeil. lie was the 
giammar-school master, and the records of 
1710 show that he was voted twenty pound;-, 
and it was provided that "those who send shall 
pay additional and board." He was "still em- 
ployed" in 1712. He was selectman in 1712, 
representative 1714-17-21, town clerk 1721-51 
(thirty years), town treasurer 1719-51 (thirty- 
two years), surveyor of lands, trader and pos- 
sessed a large estate. In 1712 the north part 
of the township of Falmouth included in what 
was called "the New Purchase," was ordered 
to be laid out; and "Thomas Bowerman and 
Philip Dexter were appointed to lay out said 
lands, and were to associate with them, in the 
performance of their tluty some suitable per- 
son. They called to their aid 'Sir. Samuel Jen- 
nings of Sandwich, an accomplished surveyor 
and good scholar, whose able and neatly pre- 
pared report of the proceedings amply justifies 
the enconium we bestow," says the historian. 
"In 1 71 7, February 6, John Bacon, agent for 
the town of Barnstable, presented a petition to 
the General Court 'for the division of the town 
into precincts ;' and, February 10, on the peti- 
tion of Mr. Joseph Crocker and others, Mr. 
Samuel Sturgis, Melatiah Bourne, Esq., and 
Mr. Samuel Jennings, were appointed 'a com- 
mittee to determine the controversy and settle 
the bounds between the said town and the In- 
dians," which was accordingly done." April 
4, 1718, Samuel Jennings in a deed of land to 
"Joseph Ney" describes himself as "shop- 
keeper." Freeman states, "In 1764, two of the 
most influential and respectable citizens of the 
town deceased, Samuel Jennings, Esq., May 
13, aged eighty, and Hon. Ezra Bourne in 
September, aged 88." On a well preserved 
slate stone in the Old Cemetery in Sandwich 
is the following inscription : "In memory of 
Samuel Jennings Esq., who having served God 
and his Generation with uprightness in several 
important trusts, deceased May 13th 1764 in 
his Both year. The memory of the just is 
blessed." The marriage between Samuel Jen- 
nnigs and Remembrance Smith, both of Sand- 
wich, was solemnized "before William Bassett, 
justice of the Peace, att Sandwich the 20th 
day of January Anno Domini 1712-13." She 
was the daughter of Shubael and granddaugh- 



ter of Rev. John Smith, who was pastor of 
Sandwich from 1675 to 1688. Near her hus- 
band's stone is a slate slab on which is the 
legend, "Here Lyes ye body of Remember 
Jennings, aged About 28 Years Deed Jan'ry 
ye 23d 1717-18." lie married (second) De- 
borah Newcomb, who died l'"cbruary 10, 1753. 
Tiie children of the first wife were Lydia and 
Ruhamah, the latter a woman of fine educa- 
tion. The children of the second wife were: 
Samuel, Esther ami John, whose sketch fol- 
lows : 

(111) John (2), youngest child of Samuel 
and Deborah (Newcomb) Jennings, was born 
in Sandwich, Massachusetts, September 3, 
1734, and died in VVinthrop, Maine, as stated 
in the Winthrop records, March 10, 1800, 
ageil sixty-five years. He was interested with 
his father in shipping, and one of their ves- 
sels was the sloop "Deborah." John used to 
take "negro and Indian boys and bring them 
up to send on whaling voyages," and was evi- 
dently a prosperous man. But after the revo- 
lution began he lost considerable property. He 
was a zealous Tory, and, history states, "was 
arrested and imprisoned in 1778 for disaffec- 
tion to the popular cause." Being a high- 
spirited man, he determined to go to a new 
country. Accordingly he took his eldest son 
and went to Maine, then being rapidly settled. 
They went up the Kennebec to the Hook (now 
Hallowell) and thence through the woods of 
Winthrop (then Pondtown), inquiring of the 
few settlers he saw for land partly fenced by 
water. This he found in Wayne, where he 
was one of the earliest settlers. There he se- 
lected a tract of about a thousand acres 
bounded on three sides by Pocasset ( now 
Wing) and Lovejoy ponds and what has since 
been called from him the Jennings stream, 
which unites the other two bodies of water. 
Here he finally obtained possession of about 
two hundred acres bordering the stream and 
the Wing pond, other settlers getting the rest. 
Here they felled a "possession," and John re- 
turned to Sandwich, leaving Samuel to fell 
more trees during the summer. The next sum- 
mer Samuel was also sent to make further im- 
provements. The next year John and his son 
John went from Sandwich and built a log house 
and extended the clearing. The greater part 
of the land John Jennings then settled on has 
ever since been the property of his descend- 
ants in the male line and is now the property 
of Tudor G. Jennings, the occupant, and his 
nephew, Loton D. Jennings, a lawver of Bos- 
ton. This is now one of the finest farms in 
Kennebec county. Vestiges of the first house

and one built later and apple trees John planted 
are still to be seen. John probably removed 
to W'ayne with his family in the spring of 
1780. They went on a vessel to Portland, and 
from there John with his son Samuel ascended 
the Kennebec in one of his old whale-boats. 
From Hallowell they made their way on foot, 
driving before them the sheep and hogs they 
had brought from Sandwich. The swine were 
subsequently taken to an island in the Andros- 
coggin pond in Leeds, where in the following 
July the outcries of the animals gave notice of 
trouble. The settlers living near hastened to 
the island and discovered that bears had killed 
the hogs, and escaped. From this circum- 
stance the island has since been known as Hog 
Island. Having no salt, the neighbors smoked 
the meat of the slaughtered animals, which 
was a substantial part of the provisions of Air. 
Jennings's family the following winter. In the 
autumn John Jennings returned to Sandwich 
to settle his affairs and came the next spring 
to Wayne, where he lived until the latter part 
of 1799, when he was taken sick and carried 
to the hoine of his daughter Deborah, wife of 
Joel Chandler, son of John Chandler, the first 
settler in Winthrop Milage and builder of the 
first mills on the stream there. The Winthrop 
records state that "]\Ir. John Jennings died at 
Winthrop, March 10, 1800." He was buried 
in the cemetery there. According to the rec- 
ord John Jennings and Hannah Sturgis, both 
of Sandwich, were married by iVIr. Abraham 
\Mlliams, minister of Sandwich, May 13, 1759. 
Hannah, born June 4. 1732, was the widow of 
Jonathan Sturgis and daughter of William and 
Bathshua (Bourne) Newcomb. They had: 
Deborah, Samuel (see below), John, Hannah, 
Bathsheba, Sarah, Nathaniel (mentioned be- 
low), and Mary — all born in Sandwich. 

(IV) Samuel (2), eldest son of John (2) 
and Hannah (Newcomb) Jennings, was born 
in Sandwich, Massachusetts, November 15, 
1762, and died in Leeds, Maine, March 23, 
1842, in his eightieth year, hie accompanied 
his father on his first visit to New Sandwich 
and was left there to continue the work of 
clearing the farm which they there began, and 
returned to Sandwich later on foot with oth- 
ers. The next spring he was sent back alone, 
to further improve the place. He boarded with 
Job Fuller, the earliest white settler in Wayne 
( 1773), and exchanged work with Eben Wing. 
They secured only a poor "burn" of tlie tim- 
ber on the ground, and the "turf" still left was 
deep; and they had to use the bag in which 
they brought their dinner to carry sand from 
the shore of the pond, to cover the corn they 



planted. Samuel soon wearied of this style of 
farming, and arranged with a neighbor to care 
for the crop, and again trudged back to Sand- 
wich, and made the best excuse he could to his 
father for thus leaving the place in the wilder- 
ness of Maine. The ne.xt spring, when the 
time for going to New Sandwich drew nigh, 
Samuel seized an opportunity when his father 
was away and went to Plymouth, and thence to 
Boston, where he met some acquaintances and 
enlisted on board a privateer which made a 
successful cruise, capturing three prizes. Sam- 
uel returning to Boston as one of the crew of 
the third one. Samuel Jennings also served 
as a private in Captain Simeon Fish's com- 
pany. Colonel Freeman's regiment, on an 
alarm at Falmouth in September, 1779. The 
next year he went with his father and his fam- 
ily to Wayne. Samuel Jennings in his account 
of the family at this time says, "They thought 
it rather hard times to live on smoked meat 
and keep their cattle on meadow hay." In the 
early spring when Samuel found the neigh- 
boring settlers could not pay in corn for cer- 
tain utensils they had bought of his father the 
year before, he went to Littleborough, now 
Leeds, some ten miles away, and worked a 
week for Thomas Stinchfield, chopping and 
piling logs for a peck of corn a day. On Sun- 
day he was set across the Androscoggin pond 
by the Stinchfield boys in a canoe, and carried 
his bushel and a half of corn on his back to 
his home, where he and his burden were 
warmly welcomed by the other members of the 
family. On the day when Samuel completed 
his twenty-first year he refused to "tote" a 
bag of corn on his back through the woods to 
mill. His father was angry, disowned him, 
and told him to leave the place. But while the 
father was absent hunting that day in Port 
Royal, now Livermore, Samuel and his 
brother John seeing a bear swimming in the 
pond, dispatched it with an axe. dressed the 
carcass and hung it on a pole. The father re- 
turning from his hunt without game and see- 
ing the supply of meat, inquired who killed 
the bear. Being told that Samuel had been 
chiefly instrumental in killing bruin, he with- 
drew his objections and the young man con- 
tinued to live at the homestead. 

In 1784 Samuel, accompanied by his brother 
John, took up a large tract of land, mostly 
rich intervale, on the bank of the Androscog- 
gin river in Leeds, where the hamlet of West 
Leeds now is. This is still owned by his de- 
scendants in the male line. Somewhat later 
he returned to Sandwich and married. Leav- 
ing his wife there, he went to Hallowell,

Maine, where lie worked for liis brolher-in- 
law, John lieenian, for four dollars a month. 
In the spring of 1787, Mrs. Jennings with her 
infant .'^on, Samuel, went to Hallowell, and 
thence to Wayne, where she met her husband. 
On their journey to Leeds they crossed the 
Androscoggin pond in a birch canoe ; the wind 
blew a gale, the waves beat over the canoe, 
compelling the mother to sit very quiet in t>:c 
bottom of the bark boat with her babe in her 
arms, while the father, alternately paddling 
and bailing, urged the canoe forward. The 
shore was reached at last, and at the house of 
Thomas Stinchfieid they were warmed and re- 
freshed, their clothing dried, and again on foot 
they made their way through the woods to 
their home. Samuel Jennings was a wealthy 
and influential farmer in Leeds. He married 
in Sandwich, in 1785, Olive Tupper, daughter 
of Enoch and Mchitable (Davis) Tupper. She 
was born February 16, 1763, and died April 
20, 1848, aged eighty-five years. They were 
the parents of Samuel, who was born in Sand- 
wich, Massachusetts, and Perez Smith, one of 
the earliest born white children in Leeds. 

(V) Samuel (3), elder of the two sons of 
Samuel (2) and Olive (Tupper) Jennings, 
was born in Sandwich, Massachusetts, Feb- 
ruary 7, 1787, and died at the village of North 
Wayne, Maine, March 29, 1876, in the nine- 
tieth year of his age. Leeds in the days of his 
boyhood was little better than an unbroken 
forest ; there was no school until after he was 
twelve years old, and many children received 
but little book knowledge : but he had all the 
school privileges the locality afforded and ac- 
quired a good common school education and a 
desire for reading, which a small library in the 
town afiforded him some means of gratifying. 
He was a constant reader throughout his life, 
especially in his age, and became familiar with 
the Bible, works of history and other books. 
In the fall of 1809 he settled on a farm on the 
west side of North Wayne, where the active 
portion of his life was spent, except six years 
between 1826 and 1832, when he lived on the 
homestead in Leeds. From 1852 to 1868 he 
live 1 with his son Seth, and after that time on 
a place he bought on the north side of North 
Wayne. He was a liberal, social and law- 
abiding citizen and a man of practical sa- 
gacity and determined will. He left a written 
account of the settlement of the familv in 
Wayne and Leeds, from which much of the 
foregoing has been taken. For a large part of 
his life he was a member of the Methodist 
Episcopal church, singing and playing the bass 
viol in the choir. He was a Whig until that 



party dissolved, and thereafter a Democrat. 
In the war of 1812 he served at Wiscassct in 
the coast defense. Mis health seemed to be 
always good, and he was never seriously ill till 
his last sickness. Samuel Jennings married 
(fir>t) in Micldleborough, Massachusetts, 
January 14, 1809, I'lieije Morton, born in Mid- 
dleborough. May 15, 1791, died at North 
Wayne, ( )ctober 26, 1858, aged si.xty-seven 
years. She was the daughter of Seth (2) and 
Priscilla (Morton) Morton (see Morton VI), 
and a cousin german of Rev. Daniel Oliver 
Morton, the father of Levi P. Morton, late 
Vice-President of the United States. She was 
related, but more remotely, to Governor Mar- 
cus and Chief Justice Marcus Morton, of Mas- 
sachusetts. She was also a descendant of 
Stephen Hopkins of "Mayflower" fame, thus: 
Deborah, daughter of Stephen Hopkins, mar- 
ried Andrew Ring; Mary Ring, their daugh- 
ter, married John Morton (2) (see Morton 
III), ancestor of Phebe Morton. Samuel Jen- 
nings was married (second) December 20, 
1868, by Rev. J. R. Mastcrman, of Wayne, to 
Laura M. (Rackley) Gilmorc, widow of Ansel 
Gilmore, of Turner, who survived him and 
died in her seventy-fifth year, while on a visit 
to Livermore, September 20, 1882. The
