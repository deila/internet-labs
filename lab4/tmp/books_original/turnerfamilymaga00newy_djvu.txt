The Turner Family 

MAGAZINE 

JANUARY. 1916 

THE FAMILY OF TURNER 



An ancient house of Norman-French origin, the Turn- 
ers appear in England at the time of the Conquest. In the 
thirty-five different branches of the British family there 
are as many varied coats-of-arms. The distinguishing 
feature of a majority of these is the mill rind in which the 
center of the millstone is set, indicating that the early 
Turners were millwrights or millers. 

In America perhaps the earliest arrival was Hum- 
phrey Turner, who settled in Plymouth, Mass., in 1628. 
He became prominent in Scituate and conducted a tan- 
nery there as early as 1636. The Turners became a 
numerous family in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and in 
Maine. , 

During King Phillip's War, Captain William Turner 
gained a great victory in the Connecticut Valley, where 
Turner's Falls, near Greenfield, Mass., was afterward 
named for him. 

In Maine the town of Turner was named for Rev. 
Charles Turner, one of the descendants of the first Hum- 
phrey. In Pennsylvania and Virginia, there were early 
arrivals who established large and prosperous communities. 
As early as 1672, Henry Turner was living in Northamp- 
ton Parish, Va. In 1750 the Turners were firmly settled 
in North Carolina. 

The Turner Family Magazine will endeavor to present 
in each issue, new and heretofore unpublished records of 
the Turners in America, and private data and records from 
family bibles are solicited for publication. In future 

1 



numbers we purpose to print nearly complete lists of the 
early Turner marriages from all the United States, from 
1630 to 1875. These alone will be well worth the price 
asked for the magazine. W. M. C. 

EARLY SETTLERS IN CONNECTICUT 

In 1760, the first permanent settlers came to North- 
field, Conn., in the Litchfield hills. These came from 
North Haven by ox team, one, Titus Turner, building a 
log house. The well dug by Turner is still in use, though 
the house has disappeared. Others followed these first 
settlers, and in 1762, the first child, James Marsh, was born 
in the new settlement, then called Litchfield Southeast 
farms. In 1778 the woods v/ere still thick so that little 
Rhoda Turner, daughter of the first settler, when sent with 
dinner to workmen cutting timber, lost her way and the 
whole settlement was roused to find her. There is a tradi- 
tion of a battle between the Litchfield Indians, or "Bunk- 
ers" and the New Haven Indians, who had come up the 
valley in quest of certain shiny stones for traders, which 
resulted in victory for the former. 

There were several taverns in Northfield, as the stage 
route between Albany and Hartford ran through the vil- 
lage. One was on the top of the hill where the churches 
which have succeeded "the church and the meetin' house" 
are still located. Three taverns were built in 1782, it is 
said. About 1800, Jacob Turner, a descendant of the first 
Titus, established a tavern, whose sign is still in existence, 
which was a half-way house, where travelers were refreshed 
and horses changed in the old stage coach days. In 1791, 
when the first post-office was established in Litchfield, a 
post rider left it once a week, on Monday morning, carry- 
ing with him the mail for "South East Farms," when on 
his way to Hartford. South East Farms was incorporated 
by the legislature as a winter parish, from November to 



April .of each year, in 1789, and the first meeting is said 
to have been held October 15 of that year. At this meet- 
ing it was voted to hire a minister to preach the gospel for 
six months, and on November 2, it was voted to lay a tax 
of £25, one-third to be raised in money, the remaining two- 
thirds in wheat, rye, corn, buckwheat or oats. In 1794 
it was voted to build a meeting house west of Titus Turn- 
er's, if that worthy consented to let the society have a con- 
venient spot for a green. In 1 794 Northfield petitioned the 
general assembly to be set off as a parish and it was in- 
corporated in the fall of that year. 

The Rev. Joseph E. Camp was pastor from 1795 to 
1837, and was known as "Priest Camp." He married 
Rhoda Turner, daughter of Titus Turner, already referred 
to as the little girl lost in the woods in 1778. He made 
brick in the brickyard of Chauncey Warner in the first 
years of his ministry and later taught school in his house. 
One of his sons was for many years a physician at North- 
field, Dr. David Bushrqd Washington Camp — usually 
known as "Dr. Bushrod" — another was Dr. Joseph W. 
Camp, of Bristol, one was a clergyman, ?nother a judge. 

PENNSYLVANIA RECORDS 

Among the office holders in the three original counties 
of Pennsylvania were the following: 

Cornelius Turner, justice of the peace in Sussex Co., 
in 1767. 

Robert Turner, one of the five provincial governors 
held office from 9 February, 1688, to 18 December. 1888. 
He was also a member of the Governor's Council from 1 693 
to 1700. He was appointed by William Penn. He was 
Recorder General from 5 May, 1686 to 4 March, 1690. and 
in 1686 was Deputy Surveyor. 

Joseph Turner was a member of the Governor's Coun- 
cil from 1747 to 1776. He died in 1783.

LEMUEL TURNER OF MAINE 

Lemuel Turner, baptized 2d church, Scituate, Mass., 
August 14,-1720, published, Scituate, September 29, 1750 
to Hannah Buck, daughter of Deacon Israel and Mary 
(Merritt) Buck of Hanover, is doubtless identical with the 
Lemuel Turner who married in Durham, Me., January 16, 
1755, Abigail Starbird. Mary (Merrit) Buck died in 1755 
and in the settlement of her estate mention is made of 
"the legal representatives of daughter Hannah deceased." 
Lemuel disappears from Massachusetts records after his 
first marriage in 1750, although an old Genealogy, pub- 
lished many years ago and sadly deficient in detail, gives 
to him and his wife Hannah Buck, a daughter Hannah, 
who is supposed to be the Hannah Turner, who married 
in Augusta, November 21, 1771, David Wall. There were 
Walls, also from Plymouth Co., in the new settlements 
along the Kennebec river about the time the Turners came 
to that section. Lemuel Turner was the first treasurer 
of the "District of Harpswell" set off from Yarmouth in 
1758. Durham and Freeport were originally included 
also in North Yarmouth. 

Plymouth Co. Probate 21-177. "Lemuel Turner of 
Harpswell Co., Cumberland, yeoman, appointed this day 
administrator of estate of his father, Isaac Turner, late of 
Hanover, deceased, September 9, 1779." 

The Maine Census, enumeration of 1790, says "Lem- 
uel Turner of Freeport, three males, including head of the 
family over 16; four females, including head of the family 
over sixteen." Lemuel and his wife were both living in 
1804. It had been no little trouble to corroborate this 
Census report, as in North Yarmouth Melzar Turner set- 
tled and his children married there. 

1. Starbird, born 1775-6, married (1) November 1775, 

Olive Davis; married (2) 1828 Blackwell, died 

Rome, 1838.

2. Desire, born October 22, 1758, married November 
28, 1776, Stephen Weston, res., Durham, Freeport. 

3. Isaac, born , married 1788, Molly Hans- 

com. (He settled in Durham). 

4. Ezekiel, born , nriarried January 12, 1792, 

Joanna Roberts. He was drowned at sea at the age of 55 
years. 

5. Abigail, born 1772, married 1793, John Hatch. 

6. Elisha, born , married August 6, 1795, 

Rachel Bray. 

7. Lydia, born , married August 20, 1776, 

Benjamin Vining. 

8. Lucy, born , married June 22. 1786, Paul 

Morse. 

Starbird, the eldest son, served at various times in the 
Revolutionary War. In 1790 he was living in Newfield 
according to the census (Washington Plantation) and his 
family then was "one male, one male under sixteen, and 
four females." 

The records of Newfield, and of surrounding towns 
(N. H. as well) afford no clue regarding him, but in 1804 
his name appears on the town records of Rome, and for 
many years he took an important part in the business of 
the town. On those records is this data, "Starbird Turner 
and Olive Turner, Inhabitants of the town of Rome, June 
1804. Married November, 1775, and have issue as follows 

1. Avis, born at Durham, N. H., March 22, 1783. 

2. Sarah, born at Newfield, May 15, 1785. 

3. Lemuel, born at Newfield, May 25, 1787. 

4. Betsey, born at Newfield, June, 1789. 

5. Asa, born at Wakefield. October 16, 1791. 

6. Daniel, born at Newfield. January 15, 1793. 

7. Abigail, born at Newfield, May 1, 1795. 

There may have been other children born previous to 
1783, as a daughter Eliza is not enumerated with the fore- 

5 



going, unless she can be identical with Betsey. She is 
buried at Rome in the same enclosure as her father. He 
has no stone to mark his grave, but hers, tells us she died 
July 17, 1837, aged 50 years. 

Descendants say that Starbird Turner's wife was 

Olive Davis. He married (2) 1828 Blackwell. 

He died in 1838. His sons, Lemuel, Asa and Daniel, all 
settled in Rome.

THE GIRLS OF BETHLEHEM 

The Moravian Seminary for Young Ladies, at Beth- 
lehem, Penn., is one of the oldest female institutions of 
learning in this country. Since 1786, thousands of 
young ladies have attended the Bethlehem school. In 
the early days few of the pupils were Moravians, but were 
members of aristocratic and wealthy families, and for 
many years the seminary was quite the vogue. The 
following list of pupils, recently found, will prove of 
great genealogical interest.

A VIRGINIA FAMILY 

(Contributed) 

Prior to 1748 were born in Virginia three brothers, 
named Shadrach, Meshack, and Abednego Turner, who 
were no doubt, the sons of Bible-reading parents. Their 
names were taken from the third chapter of the Book 
of Daniel, wherein is written: 

"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshack, and Abed- 
nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants 
that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, 
and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve 
nor worship any god except their own God." — Daniel 
III. 28. 

Shadrach Turner was the owner of 4400 acres of 
land in Halifax County. The first patent was in 1748. 
He was active in his county, being overseer of roads and 
processioner of lands. He lived next in Pittsylvania 
County, then in Henry County, where he died accord- 
ing to his will, made in 1783. 

William Turner a son of Shadrach was born in 1753 
and was in the Revolutionary War in 1777. He married 
Jane Hunter, daughter of William Hunter. For 72 years 
they were members of the Baptist Church. William 
Turner was the father of a large family and a remarkable 
thing was their longevity, twelve of his sons and daughters 
averaging 83 years of life.

EARLY ENGLISH TURNERS 

(Contributed) 

William Turner, a native of Morpeth, Northumber- 
land, was educated at Pembroke hall, Cambridge. He 
warmly embraced the tenets of the reformation, and 
preached to various congregations, till Gardiner, jealous 
of his popularity, imprisoned him. When liberated he 
went to the continent, and took his doctor's degree of 
medicine at Ferrara. He returned to England, on Ed- 
ward's accession, and was made dean of Wells, but he 
went into exile, under Mary, till the elevation of Eliza- 
beth recalled him, and restored him to his ecclesiastical 
honors. He wrote a treatise on the baths of England, 
and Germany, and various botanical works. He died 
in 1568. 

Thomas Turner, an able divine, was born at Reading, 
Berks, and educated at St. John's college, of which he 
became a fellow. He was in 1629 made residentiary of 
St. Paul's, and chaplain to Charles I. whom he accom- 
panied in his expedition to Scotland, and in 1641, he was 
made dean of Rochester, and soon after of Canterbury. 
These dignities, and particularly the favor of Charles, 
rendered him very suspected to the parliament, and 
during the civil wars, he was stripped of his preferment, 
with every mark of cruel insult, and meditated ignominy. 
The restoration replaced him in his ecclesiastical offices 
and he died in 1672, aged 81. 

Francis Turner, son of the above, was educated at 
Winchester school, and New college, Oxford, and he 
afterwards obtained a prebend of St. Paul's, and the 
deanery of Windsor. He was in 1683, made bishop of 
Rochester, and the next year removed to Ely, but his 
opposition to the king's measures rendered him unpop- 
ular at court, and he was one of the seven bishops sent to 
the Tower. At the revolution he refused to take the 
oaths to William, and was consequently deprived of his 

41 



perferment. He wrote some sermons, besides religious 
poems, and the life of Nicholas Ferrar, and died in pri- 
vacy, 1700. Robert Turner, an English divine, quitted 
the kingdom to preserve his attachment to the Romish 
church. He was for some time in the service of the 
duke of Bavaria, who employed him in negotiations, and 
he afterwards became canon of Breslau, and died at Gratz, 
1597. He wrote commentaries on Scripture and other 
theological works.

JESSE TURNER OF ARKANSAS 

(Contributed) 

Jesse Turner, a famous lawyer of Arkansas, was of 
Irish ancestry. His grandfather Jam es, a highly re- 
-spectable farmer, emigrated from the North part of Ire- 
land and settled in Lancaster county, Penn., about the 
year 1760. The maternal branch of the family, by name 
Clendenin, were also from the same part of Ireland. 
Soon after the settlement of the grandfather in Lancaster 
county, James, the father of Jesse, was born. About 
the year 1765, the family removed to Orange county. 
North Carolina. 

The spirit of independence and liberty was exhibited 
in the Turner family before the revolution. In that 
serious and singular outbreak against the courts and 
lawyers of North Carolina, the elder James participated. 
He fought at the once famous battle of Almance, and 
acted as a "Regulator" in all the noted and daring inci- 
dents of the rebellion. 

In the war of the revolution which soon after fol- 
lowed, the younger James underwent the hardships, 
privations and misfortunes that were companions of the 
American soldiers in those days of tribulation. He 
fought under Greene on the bloody field of Guilford Court 
House. He served in expeditions against the Tories, and 
was prisoner for six months in the dungeons of the British 
at Charleston. 

After the revolution he remained in Orange county, 
an independent cultivator of the soil, and here Jesse 
Turner was born. At the Salem meetinghouse, under the 
tuition of Daniel Turrentine, he received the rudiments 
of his education. Upon leaving school his choice of pro- 
fessions fell upon the law. Accordingly, in the vicinity 
of Chapel Hill, under the direction of William McCauley, 
he entered upon and pursued that study with such close 
application and success that a license to practice in the 

57 



county courts was granted him by the termination of 
a year. Another twelve months placed him in possession 
of a license to practice in the Superior Courts. 

Being now a full practitioner, Mr. Turner com- 
menced the prosecution of professional duties in his 
native State at Waynesboro, in Wayne county. But 
looking abroad, an ampler field for his exertions was 
presented in the new territories of the West, and he emi- 
grated to Arkansas. His arrival was at that time when 
rude log huts, scattered at far distances, marked the 
abodes of civilization; when the practice of courts was 
unsettled, and juries gave verdicts that illy accorded 
with "law and evidence"; when crimes and misdemeanors 
prevailed to an extent that blackened the character of 
the territory. 

Mr. Turner, a stranger stripling, without money or 
friends, without experience or advice, began the practice 
of his profession at the seat of justice of Crawford county. 
He was once elected to the General Assembly of Arkan- 
sas, and as a member attained the highest distinction. 
In 1840 he took an active part in the Presidential contest. 
At the Whig Convention held at Little Rock in that 
year, he was called to preside over its deliberations by 
acclamation. In 1841 he was selected by Hon. John 
Bell, Secretary of War, as one of the Committee of Visi- 
tation to attend the examination of Cadets at West Point, 
but was prevented from being present by indisposition. 

In 1842, Mr. Turner was married to Miss Violetta 
P. Drennen, of Pittsburg, Penn. She died the following 
year and there were no children. 

In the Presidential canvass of 1848, Mr. Turner was 
chosen one of the Whig electors for Arkansas. He can- 
vassed the western and northern portions of the State, 
battling with eloquence and enthusiasm for the princi- 
ples of his party. 

He never sought an office. When on a visit to the 

58 



north in the spring of 1841, intending to pay his respects 
to the President, he arrived at Washington. But General 
Harrison was no more. He, however, called on Mr. 
Tyler, who disposing of the eager office seekers that 
thronged the White House, turned to Mr. Turner, in- 
quiring blandly what office he desired. Mr. Turner 
arose immediately from his chair, and remarked with 
warmth, "Office! good heavens, sir! I want no office 
whatever, and wish not to be "considered, sir, in that 
class that prowl about you seeking the spoils of our 
Government." 

MICAH TURNER OF WEYMOUTH 

(Contributed) 

Micah and Betthiah (Allen) Turner of Weymouth, 
Mass., had twelve children, six of them sons. Of the 
later, three died in October, 1751, (Weymouth Vital Rec- 
ords). David, born 1741, Micah, born 1752, Jacob, 
born 1756. Micah, Jr., married Mary Pratt in 1779. 
The twelfth child of Micah and Betthiah Turner was a

JABEZ TURNER 

In 1887, one of the few remaining veterans of the 
War of 1812, Jabez Turner, died at his home, No. 183 
Hudson Street, New York City. He had almost completed 
his eighty-ninth year. He was born in 1797 on his father's 
farm, in Berkshire County, Mass., where he remained 
until the war of 1812 broke out. He enlisted as a pri- 
vate. After the war he came to New York, and after 
some time obtained employment with the Delaware and 
Hudson Canal Company, with whom he remained for 
about twenty years as a weigher. He never joined the 
Association of the Veterans of the War of 1812, nor took 
any active part in politics. 



William Turner was the first settler in Candia, 
N. H., buying land there in 1741. In 1747, he married 
Sarah Colby, daughter of Enoch Colby and Abigail 
Sanborn. He died 8 December, 1796; his wife 28 May, 
1810-11.

AN ENGLISH WILL 

(Contributed) 

In Fewston, England, Robert Turner, who died in 
the year 1551, was of kindly disposition and charitable, 
as will be seen by the following bequest in his last will and 
testament. 

"To Thomas Thorpe, my nevey, all my lether and 
all maner of stuff belonging to the occupacion within 
my shoppe. Allso I will yt he make thirtyn pair of 
shoys, which shalbe geven to thirtyn pooer folkes within 
the paryshe of Fuyston." 

Evidently Robert Turner was the owner of a shoe- 
shop in his native town. 

MAJOR HARRY TURNER OF VIRGINIA 

(Contributed) 
Major Harry Turner of Virginia, died in 1751 (before 
his father), and was the only son of Doctor Thomas Turner, 
the immigrant to reach manhood. He married Eliza- 
beth, the only surviving daughter of Colonel Nicholas 
Smith of "Smith's Mount" in Westmoreland County, 
Va. Major Harry Turner married Elizabeth Smith, with 
a goodly dower of lands and other possessions, inherited 
from her opulent father. Major Turner left one son, 
Thomas, who married Colonel William Fauntleroy's 
daughter. Miss Jane Fauntleroy of "Nayor's Hole." 
They had four sons and four daughters. 

Thomas Turner, the father of Major Harry, settled 
at Port Conway, and owned large estates. He probably 
married a Taliaferro. 

Major Harry Turner was one of the incorporators of 
Bary's Church on the Rappahannock. The titles were 
invested in Thomas Lee, Esq., Charles Carter, Thomas 
Turner, Harry Turner. Maxniillion Robinson and Nicholas 
Smith, gentlemen. 

In the graveyard of "Smith's Mount" is the tomb of 
Colonel Nicholas Smith, with this inscription: 

71 



"Here lies the body of Col. Nicholas Smith, son of 
Elizabeth Smith, born in London, the fourth day of Sep- 
tember, 1666. Married his wife in the twenty-third 
year of her age, by whom he had no child. Married his 
second v/ife in 1722, by which he had three children, 
one son and two daughters. Departed this life the 1 8th 
of March, 1734, in the 68th year of his age." 

T wo of these children died, and Major Harry, as above 
stated married the surviving daughter, Elizabeth. 

At Port Conway, there is an Episcopal Chapel and 
in the yard is the tomb of Harry Turner, with this in- 
scription: 

"Beneath this marble 
Are deposited the remains of 
Major Harry Turner, 
1751, 
And Elizabeth his wife, 
1752. 
"Who with credit and esteem possessed and enjoyed, 
an ample fortune from which unerring wisdom, 
thought fit to snatch them in their bloom, together 
•With three sons who all dyed in their infancy." 
The Arms on the tomb of Major Harry Turner, at 
Port Conway are Ermine, four fer-de-molines, sable. 
Crest: Allion (sargent) holding in the dexter paw, 
a fer-de-moline, sable. Motto "Esse quam videri." 

EDWARD OF WALPOLE, MASS. 

(Contributed) 

Edward Turner of Walpole, Mass., married in Med- 
field, 7 June, 1 763, Hannah Fisher. They lived in Temple- 
ton, where eight children were born. He was a lieuten- 
ant in the army and died in the service, 26 December, 
1777, aged thirty-two years. His widow was granted a 
State pension seven years, beginning 1777, and subse- 
quently a United States pension. She died in Temple- 
ton, 26 July, or 28, 1840, aged ninety-six years.
