'^'"^ PREFACE. 

IN response to a demand often expressed by users of the 
Shorthand Dictionary, it was decided to add to the words 
it contained their ordinary meanings, with occasional notes 
concerning their origins. It was, in fact, impossible to resist 
the argument that it is vastly more convenient to use one book 
of reference than to have to use two, and accordingly the task 
of making the dictionary complete and self-contained was 
attempted, and has, it is hoped, been accompUshed to the 
edification of those who may refer to it. 

In order to keep the volume within reasonable hmits, a great 
degree of economy had to be practised. Words have a tendency, 
the result of their handling sometimes by ordinary folk and 
sometimes by writers, to pass from their primary and obvious 
meanings to metaphorical senses. Only in a large and compre- 
hensive dictionary would it be possible to follow every word 
into a variety of usages, and here this has been done sparingly; 
for, given one or two of its meanings, anyone meeting a word 
in a connection different from its natural setting would at once 
perceive that metaphor had been at work upon it, and be able 
to see how it had acquired this further meaning. 

It is very tempting klso to trace words to their earliest dis- 
coverable source, but again that process would result in extending 
the bulk as well as the scope of the present book. Its purpose is 
to furnish the writer of shorthand with a ready means of finding 
the common and regular signification of each word the shorthand 
outline of which he requires to learn. What such a student 
needs for his purpose is the immediate and obvious rather than 
the recondite. 

Into the making of an English Dictionary Dr. Johnson intro- 
duced a delightful feature, the illustration of the meanings and 
usages of words by means of literary passages in which they occur. 
In a particular context, and especially when placed there by one 
of the makers of literature, a word is invested with a new life and 
power, and it needs the quotation for the lexicographer adequately " 
to convey the acquired meaning. To attempt this here was 
also out of the question, and the modest rdle assumed confines 
the /ambition of this Dictionary within the Umit of a desire to 
explain simply and usefully the words of the vocabulary. 

Subject, therefore, to these restrictions, the work is submitted 
to the pubUc of shorthand writers and students, in the hope 
and with the intention that it may be a real help to them.

INTRODUCTION. 

THE object of the present work is to furnish standard forms for 
the words of the EngUsh language, written in accordance with the 
rules of Pitman's Shorthand (Centenary Edition). Every writer of 
the system is aware that the use of the many regularized abbreviating 
devices which results in brief and facile outUnes being obtained for the 
great majority of words without the help of any arbitrary abbrevia- 
tion, also involves, in many instances, a choice between two or more 
possible forms, and the Shorthand Dictionary provides those out- 
lines which experience has shown can be recommended for general 
adoption. Hence the importance and utility of the work as a book of 
reference for teachers, students, and practitioners. 

A considerable number of words have been added, including some new 
words ; while, on the other hand, many words now obsolete have 
been excluded. 

Every effort has been made to render the present edition of the 
Dictionary reliable and consistent in regard to pronunciation and the 
selection of the shorthand forms. There will, no doubt, be differences 
of opinion with regard to the outlines for certain words, since a form 
which is the most convenient to one writer is not invariably so to 
another writer. It is strongly recommended, however, that the 
closest possible adherence to Dictionary outlines be observed, since 
they have been decided upon as the result of experience and the most 
careful thought. No outline, therefore, should be rejected in favour 
of another until an attempt has been made to ascertain whether there 
is not some special reason for its adoption. It is obvious that uni- 
formity of outline is especially helpful in the case of writers who have 
to read or transcribe each other's notes. 



Changes as regards Pronunciation. 

With respect to pronunciation, this has been carefully checked 
throughout, A New English Dictionary, edited by Sir James A. H. 
Murray, LL.D., being taken as the authority in practically all cases, 
so far as that work is available. 

The principal changes, so far as vowel-sounds are concerned, consist 
of the substitution of — 

(a) ah for d in such words as bar, harm, embark. 

There are, of course, many words in which the vowel a before r has 

ix 



X INTRODUCTION 

a short sound; e.g., ' \; \ globular, \: n pillar. Compare 
[/'■ tarry (adjective) with l^' tarry (verb). 

(b) aw for ah in such words as tawnt, launch, saunter. 

(c) u for 6 when occurring medially in unaccented syllables ; e.g., 
in custom, mason, I^ondon, monopoly, gallop. 

A long vowel tends to become short when it is unaccented, and in 
some words, such as proclaim, biograph, the vowels o and u are 
practically indistinguishable. In others, however, e.g., flotation, 
nobility, the vowel is unmistakably o although unaccented. 

(d) e for a in such words as accurate, breakage, palace, chieftam, 
i.e., whenever the former represents the true pronunciation. 

Here again, the long vowel tends to become short when it is 

unaccented. Compare r lace with n/ palace. In some cases, 
however, including all verbs ending in -ate, the vowel a is long, 

although it may be unaccented. Compare <v^ moderate (adjective) 

with 1^ moderate (verb). 

(e) i for a in ^^i marriage, ■. — ^1 carriage, etc. 

(/) t for I in words ending in -ization, e.g., realization, capitalization. 

Preference is also given in the New English Dictionary to the 
pronunciation in in some further adjectives ending in -ine which were 
previously vocalized with i, e.g., Florentine, although generally both 
pronunciations are given. In most adjectives ending in -He, however, 
preference is given to t, although in these also both pronunciations 
are generally given. 

(g) wah for waw in French words containing oi, e.g., patois, boudoir. 

(A) The stroke g is written instead of k wherever the former represents 

the true pronunciation, as in ~| exist. 



Note. — In such words as ranch, French, inch, punch, with regard 
to which authorities differ, ch, which is believed to represent the 
more usual pronunciation, is retained. 

The pronunciation of French and other foreign words hcis been 
shown with greater precision than hitherto. 



SimplUications as regards Vocalization which do not involve the 
Alteration of any Rule in the Text-books. 

(1) Diphthong u between two Strokes. — The diphthong it 
when occurring between two strokes is now treated in the same 
way as a third-place vowel ; i.e., it is always written before 

the second of the two strokes ; thus, i (' Hercules, ( culinary, 

accurate. 

(2) Vocalization in Derivative Words. — A vowel in a derivative 



INTRODUCTION. Xl 

word, whether occurring in a (grammatical) prefix or suffix, such as 
re-, pre-, -able, -ance, or in the portion representing the root word, 
follows the ordinary rules as regards the stroke to which it is to be 
placed, and if it is immediately followed hy another vowel, a diphone 

is used ; thus, \ . prefigure, ^ measurable, ^i-^—'^^^unaccented, 

/ re-examine. 

Note.— This does not apply to Compound Words, or to words like 
A singer, /^\ wringer. 

(3) Third-place Vowel occurring on same side of Stroke 
AS shun Hook. — Any vowel- (or diphthongal-) sign other than a dot 

vowel is placed outside final shun hook ; thus Y\ delusion, \S fusion, 

/ Vo^ alleviation (but \^> vision). All third place signs are written 

inside medial shuyi hook ; thus, i_^ educational. 

(4) Vocalization of ng. — Outlines containing stroke ng, when used 
in the representation of the suffix -ing are now vocalized in the 
ordinary way, whether the vowel is a third-place vowel or otherwise ; 

thus, r laying, ^ — .^ gnawing. 

Changes Consequent upon Alteration of Text-book Rules. 

The principal changes arising from the simplification of existing 
rules and the introduction of new rules in the text-books are as 
follows — 

A. As regards Vocalization — 

(1) Second-place short vowels occurring between two strokes are 
now placed after the first stroke in the same way as second-place long 

vowels ; thus, r mental. 

(2) The diphthong l is always written in the first-place, and the 
diphthong ow in the third-place ; thus, V— time, v._p ounce, except 
in a few cases when joined, as in -— v nigh, — J^w ignite, tf owl ; 
also in words like /'\^ radii and 7'^ Ohio. 

(3) The diphthong u is now joined finally after — , — , ^-v, 
/^. or f (up), as /"^ rescue, \—^ argue, ^— > mew, /^ imbue, 
V/ value. 

(4) The form of the diphthong oi has 43een slightly modified, thus, 
■^ instead of "^ , in order to differentiate this sign from those of the 

series, now known as " diphones," which always represent two 
separately -sounded vowels. 

(5) The sign l has been discarded, except as the logogram for 
why ; hence the outlines <^ wife, <^ wide, c( white. 



Xll INTRODUCTION 

(6) " Triphones " (formed by the addition of a small tick to the 
diphthong-sign) are now used to represent a diphthong followed by 
any short vowel ; thus, V dial, ^ royal, y trowel, Y~ dual. 

Note. — A triphone takes the position of its diphthong. 

(7) The small shun hook after a circle is not vocalized when a second- 
place vowel precedes, a third-place vowel now being written outside 
the hook ; thus, <j' cessation, t decision. 

(8) The small circle used to represent a vowel occurring between 
the two consonants expressed by a hooked form of the pr, pi series 
is now, except in a few instances, written after the double consonant ; 
thus, Ut^ atmosphere : and when the vowel B occurs between the 
two consonants represented by the hooked form, it is not expressed 
even if it is accented ; thus, l^--^_p terminus. 

(9) joined to downward / in the proper names /^ William, 

L-^ Wilkins, etc., is now taken to represent wi. 

(10) The signs of the ah-i series, now known as " diphones," are used 
to represent any two consecutive vowels, without regard to accentua- 
tion ; thus, w real, / ' " reality, ''^sr-v* museum, c^ — ^.^-—^ cranium, 
Kj folio, /^ re-echo. 

B. As r^ards Outlines — ■ 

(1) In writing n s m the circle s is now placed inside the m in the 
following cases — 

(a) In DERIVATIVES and compounds from words in which the circle 
is written inside the m ; e.g., vLo— y unseemly, vix<j~> unsummoned, 
L_y-^ tinsmith (compare ^-^t^^ newsmonger) ; also in the word 
■ v_jcj— -~_^ insomnia. 

(6) In words containing the syllable -some, e.g., y-<s~^ noisome, 
N-oN handsome. 

Note. — It will be found that, with only two or three exceptions, e.g., 
' — -J^-j mincemeat, Norseman, and «5+j>cs nursemaid, the form 

^—er-N is used for n s m and the form n,.j>-n for n z m, most of the 
examples of the latter being words ending in -ism, e.g., O?-^ communism, 
^v.^,jt-v galvanism. 

(2) \ is now used, instead of n^, as under — 



INTRODUCTION xlfi 

(a) When not joined to another stroke, if there is no preceding 
vowel, as A flow, \ fleece, ^ flat, ^ flaunt, ^^\ Flanders. 

(b) In derivatives and compounds from the words referred to in 
(a), provided a convenient outline is so obtained, as V fleecer, 
'\^ flaunting, ^-\^ flyer, \] fluttered, ^ flatly. 

(c) Before — — ^-^ ^^ -^^ / as in Y flake, \_ flog, 

^--^ flame, \/ flurry, \ Fletcher. 

Note. — Subject to the above, preference is still given to the 
" left " form V_ ; thus, n-i^-^ flicker, ^ flavour, ^ flail, V_y flesh, 
V. flabby. 

(3) Shr is now written upward when following /, v, n or ng, as in 
S^y fissure, /: S=/ lavisher, \^j<y extinguisher. 

(4) Stroke n-s is used in all cases for final -nee or -nse (= ms) after 
a curve ; thus, vb silence, /-vf. ambulance. 

(5) A few words ending in -uation in which there would be some 
difficulty in writing separate sh hooked for n are now written with the 

shun hook (the diphthong and vowel being omitted) ; e.g. , \^ punctuation, 
fluctuation. 

(6) The forms ) and ) are used only in such words as )• Hesse, 

y hazy, in which the s or « is followed by a final vowel ; hiss, haze, 
haziness, hasten, hasty, etc., are, therefore, written with upward stroke 

h; thus, d^' <f^ /~^ /^ erf 

(7) The use of tick h before / is discontinued ; hence <y) heather, 
a-l^ hitherto. 

(8) Initial r is written downward before m or mp ; thus, ^r^. remit, 
remittance, V-s romp. 

(9) Upward / is used instead of the downward in such words as 

K trial, y" dual, r toivel, the diphthong and vowel now being 
represented by one sign. See No. A (6) above. 

(10) A stroke having a finally-joined diphthong may be halved for 
t or d : thus, ^ proud, Va bout. 

Note. — This nile does not hold good where it is necessary to have 
a distinction, as in V Bude, but >| Bute. Par. 141 (c) in the 
Instructor should be borne in mind in this connection. 



XlV INTRODUCTION 

(11) In addition to the words \ : picture, bv,..j_^ adventure, 

etc., in which -ture was previously expressed by doubling, other 
common words ending in -ture axe now written with double-length 
strokes, provided the resulting outlines are not such as would be con- 
fused with those of words ending in -tor : thus l. structure, 

\ fracture, ^~_^ nature. 

(12) F, sh, m and n may now be doubled to express the addition of 
tr, dr or thr without any restriction, except in proper names ; thus, 

^* — fodder, — '\ shudder, < — x madder, ^ -j kneader. 

{V3) A straight stroke may now be doubled to add tr or dr when it 
has an initial circle, as in >. sceptre, scatter, or a finally- 

joined diphthong, as in \ prouder, | tutor. 

(14) rf-v and s^ may be doubled to express the addition of -r ; 
thus, ^ slumberer, f lingerer. 

(15) Stroke <^ is now used whenever convenient in words begin- 
ning with the sound of « ; thus, <^ ^ Europe, oXi utilize, 

^ ' eulogy, 6^ unique. 

(16) The sign ^ is used in words beginning with wor- followed 
by m, i.e., in v— > warm, \^ warmth, etc, 

(17) Stroke ^ is used instead of dot -ing after — , — , /» 
v_ . v_ and ^ ; thus, ^-r> — .^ making, I . . digging, ^'X^ raging, 
C V»_> laughing, ^i v^ solving, v"^"^ halting. 

(18) Disjoined I is used to represent the termination -lousness 
as well as -lessness : thus, \/i perilousness, h/° sedulousness. 

(19) Disjoined / is used to represent the terminations -logical 
and -logically : thus, '1-7-^/ etymological-ly , \ — ^_^/ terminological. 

(20) The disjoined circle used to represent the suffix -self is dis- 
continued, and oneself is now included in the list of Contractions. 

(21) With reference to paragraph 188 (1) of the Instructor, n is now 
omitted — 

(a) In words ending in -gency (except 0\ agency) ; thus, 

pungency : and 



INTRODUCTION XV 

(b) In a further few words ending in -nger ; viz., \^ harbinger, 

~~K exchanger, / ginger, in addition to those given in the Lists of 
Contractions (U danger, \ stranger, ^ passenger and / messenger). 

Other Changes* Outlines Harmonized. 

With respect to other alterations in outlines, many groups of more 
or less similar words have been considered with a view to their being 
treated uniformly so far as is practicable, and various changes have 
been necessary in order to bring the outlines of such words into 
harmony. The following classes of words are mentioned for the purpose 
of furnishing an explanation of some of the changes referred to, and at 
the same time showing the general practice which has been followed 
in each class of words. 

S, Z (Circle and Stroke). 

(1) Words ending in -nese and -nize, most of which are Derivatives, 
are written with stroke n and circle s (z) whenever convenient ; thus, 

/ Japanese, -.^r-y^' v Americanize, a-<Lp humanize. 

(2) Words ending in -nism are written with v^j>-^ unless a better 
outline is obtained by writing hook n and X^ The latter is found 
to be the more convenient form after \ \ — [but not <= — or 
( J — ^^ o^ ^—^ I \ Examples : \/.L_>-^ Puritanism, 
^ •LiSr~~^ religionism : but <^lr Utopianism, ^^Anglicanism, 
\— 3 paganism. .|_^ 

(3) Words ending in -ess. All words (feminines) ending in -ess 
cannot conveniently be treated uniformly, but the following shows 
the practice which has been followed — 

(a) In words ending with the syllable -ess, stroke s is used if neces- 
sary for the purpose of distinguishing the feminine singular from the 
masculine plural when no other means of distinction is available ; 

thus, ^ poetess, {\ poets), \ heiress ( d heirs). 



ip) With regard to those words ending in -eress, -oress, -dess, -n(t)ess 
or -fess in which alternative methods of distinction are available, 

stroke s is used after //111 <= — — r^a -= ^* or / ; thus, 



\\ archeress, '/manageress, k tutoress, [-murderess, ^^=-=-\ 



mcaress. 



INTRODUCTION 



1—3 deaconess, ) countess, ^ championess, k chiefess : but in other 

7 y IV '/ /vN 

cases the circle is written, e.g., ^~^ viscountess, C, giantess. 
/vv ' lioness, NA^ baroness, /y^ mayoress. 

(c) In words ending in -ress immediately preceded by a consonant, 
the final s sound is always represented by the circle ; thus, t actress, 
t^h waitress. 

(4) Words ending in -zoon are written with stroke z : thus, 
^.epizoon, V -c)^ polyzoon (plural \/ ./'' polyzoa) ; but adjectives 
ending in -zoic have the circle ; thus, V paleozoic, \_ protozoic. 

(5) Derivatives from words with outlines containing stroke s. 
(See also paragraph 70 (a) of the Instructor and No. (2) below.) 

Derivatives formed by adding a suffix beginning with a vowel to a 
primitive word ending with s or ^ and a vowel retain stroke s or z ; 
thus, <^ cosier, ' 1 lazier, X/^ pursuance, [ Sadducean, 
\ Puseytsm, I g^ laziest, \ busiest. 

Compare — (a) Secondary derivatives, such as \ spiciest, d sauciest, 
c— 6 glossier, the primitives of which axe written with circle s ; and 

{p) Derivatives in which the suffix does not commence with a vowel ; 
e.g.. \tj> drowsiness, ^ , ensued, \^ busily. 

S (Stroke and Circle) ; ST ([ and Loop). 

(1) Initial s or st followed by a diphone is written as follows — 

(a) With stroke s or f in derivatives such as 1 sower, 1 seer, 
[!: stayer, r stowage. ^ 

(6) With the circle or loop in other words, such as ''x sahib, 
9^ stance, ci^f. sienna, =^ stoic, <^ Styrian. 

Initial s or st followed by a triphone is written with stroke s or f ; 
thus, ]_^ Siam, ) suet, [jr Stuart, L steward, y~ Stowell. 

(2) While words ending in -ous preceded by a diphthong are written 
with stroke s in accordance with paragraph 70 (d) of the Instructor, 
their derivatives ending in -uously, -uousness and -uosity are generally 

written with the circle ; thus \_fi strenuously, v/^ ] voluptuousness, 
n. K Kfi 



1 



impetuosity. 



INTRODUCTION 



The following, however, are cases in which the stroke is retained for 
the purpose of distinction — ^^ pioiisly, (^joyously, / joyousness, 

ingenuously, fi^ ingenuousness, l^^ tenuously, 

tenuousness, J sinuosity. 
(2a) In other words containing s, z or st preceded by a triphone 
or by a diphone, the circle or loop is used ; e.g., >o bias, x. biased, 
V^ quiesce, '^^—f. acquiesce, Q_p Genoese, <?* essayist, h^ truest, l)^ deist, 
C Judaism, j^ statuesque. The following are exceptions to this — 

\ prowess, r dais, ) chaos, ^~^ newest, {^-^ next). 
M ') 

(3) Words ending in -astic or -istic are written as follows — 

(a) With st loop after t, d, j or / ; thus, '^(ST" artistic, BT"' deisiic, 
it- logistic, ( elastic. 

(6) With I in other cases ; thus, t>«' theistic, r^' sophistic. 

(4) I is retained in derivatives from words with outlines con- 
taining I , except the monosyllabic past tenses *( stayed, J stewed, etc. ; 
thus, R stowage, b" dustiness, </ majestic. 

ST (Loop and ) ST). 

Words ending in -nest, -nist ; -jest, -vest, -vist ; -test, -tist, -dest, 
etc., are written with the st loop unless a distinctly better outline 

is obtained by means of the stroke ; thus, - — ^ keenest, e— O greenest, 

\ — ^ organist, \ briefest, \ bravest, V,_- faintest, ^-^^ fondest, 

y b artist, but y plainest, w toughest, V kindest, ) hardest. 

SST ( 9 . } AND P ). 

Words ending in -cest, -cist and -sest are generally written with 
^ ; thus, ^--s fiercest, X ^ publicist ; but } is more convenient 

after -^-^ n or ^-^ r, as in ^ S nicest, ,></•<). empiricist ; and \ is 
used in s^ biblicist. Y is also used in verbs ending in -sist, e.g., 
Xs subsist, p desist. 
•— (I7«) 



Xviii INTRODUCTION 

SS, SZ (Large Circle, ) ) and j). 

(1) Words ending in -sis and -sus axe written with the large circle ; 
thus, Ng basis, ° Q narcissus. 

(2) Words ending with the sound of sSs or zes, or with s - — sepa- 
rated by a diphthong or a diphone (including words ending in -cess, 
-cize and -size), are generally written with ^ or j ; thus, V access, 

\ capsize, i^ gaseous ; but after (, > v^_^ or .^^, J aftords a 
better joining, e.g., ' L Gothicize, \_^ princess, ^^^J. recess, 
-^d exorcize. The common words olD success, ^tt exercise and 

^ emphasize, are, however, written with the large circle. 

(3) Words ending in -cism are generally written with the large 
circle ; thus, ^:^--i fanaticism, . i Gallicism ; but after \ th, > n 

or -^ r J-^ gives more convenient and distinctive outlines ; thus, 
( Gothicism, J~^ cynicism, C ' -dh^ laconicism, _u^^ exorcism, 
""^ K-<)^ Doricism. 

Hooked Stroke and Separate R or L. 

(1) Words ending in -metry and -metric are written with separate r 
whenever practicable ; thus, 1^4/ geometry, v-v/^ barometric, 
but V,^ planimetry. 

(2) Words ending in -able or -ible are generally written with the 

hooked stroke N ; thus, '^. obtainable, ^ measurable. The 

separate strokes N/ , however, are used when a better outline is 
thus obtained ; e.g. — 

(a) After — o> _d> •-—!>> ^ or after a circle following a "right " 
curve (but not after Vo or vd ) ; thus, "\j excusable, 

^"^-vjQ^ invincible, ^^^^t/ reversible, ^^ ^ forcible (but 

Va feasitfle). 



INTRODUCTION 



(6) After |\ or / ; thus, ov^ contestable, J digestible. 

(c) After >> I or a dovmstroke hooked for v : thus, 
Si^ explainable, a< discernible, ^\/^ provable. 

(d) After a half-length stroke hooked for n ; thus, \^^ accountable, 
C >< lamentable. 

{e) After a shun hook ; thus, x/^ actionable (but •t-._:2\ men- 

tionable) . 

(3) Words ending in -tal or -dal preceded by --^ r axe written 
with separate I : thus, %^K parietal, V/Zf spheroidal. Coni- 
pare the verbs <\ rattle, ^ \ riddle. A number of words ending in 
-tal preceded by n are also written with separate / ; e.g., y^ mental, 
<iCi horizontal. Compare the verb 1 mantle. 

(4) Words ending in -/u/ and -jully are written with separate / in 
cases where a distinction between the adjective and the adverb can 
easily be shown by means of the downward and the upward / respec- 
tively ; e.g., after — , — , ^ — ■, >w, upward / or a straight upstroke ; 

thus, V_ wakeful, \/ wakefully, y manful, n V lawful. 



^ 



sorrowful. In other words, including verbs, fl and vl occurring after 
the strokes mentioned above are represented by the hooked forms 
\ > ; thus, ' 1 scuffle, Z"*"^ A level, /\r ^ upheaval. 

(5) Words ending in -ively preceded by '^~o, "-t or ■ are written 
with ) ; thus, A. massively, yt \ delusively. 

(6) Words beginning with unr-, enr-, unl-, enl-. Words formed by 
a prefix from words beginning with r or / retain the separate r or / ; 

thus, vj/^ unrest, -~i,y^^^^ unreasoning, vj_X unleavened. 

6. enlist. 

(7) Words ending in -ary, -ery, -ory, etc., are treated as follows — 

(a) The hooked strokes are used when they give a more easily written 
outline than the sej^arate r: thus, k drapery. x^~^ rookery, 

treasury. 

(b) The hooked strokes are retained in adjectives derived from 

words written with a final hooked stroke, such as k tottery, £ \ silvery, 

i '• 

*>- savoury. 



) 



JtX INTRODUCTION 

•p 

(c) In other cases the separate r or / is written ; thus, statutory, 

VI' /• "1^' 

]/ notary. 

(8) Derivatives ending in -ally and -alize from words written 
with a final hooked stroke retain the hooked form ; thus, *^ brutally, 
%, brutalize, r'' locally. 

(9) Derivatives from words written with hooked forms of the 
•pr, pi series are generally also written with the hooked forms if practic- 
able, even if the r or / is no longer in the same syllable as the preceding 

consonant ; thus, J , tippler, *^-<> trampling, J" doubly. Compare 

such words as .V^^ seedling, \~ (^~^ duckling, which are not so 
derived. 

(10) In Compound Words, when the second part of the compound 
begins with r or I, that r or / is not combined with the last letter 

of the first part ; hence, T y^ typewriter, T typewritten, 

\_/'' » bricklayer, v_, — >' necklace. 

(11) In the case of verbs the hooked forms are generally preferred 
so as to enable past tenses to be written on the same principle ; thus, 

I* bridle, \ bridled (compare ''^ bridal), * | model, ' ^ modelled. 

Duplicate Forms. — Cases where Joined to Another Stroke. 

(1) In Derivatives and Compounds from words written with 

^ ^ V. 1. etc., the form of fr, ft, vr or vl used in the primitive 
should, when convenient, also be used in the derivative or compound, 
without regard to the practice adopted in other words ; thus, 

\_p freeness (compare 'V.^p furnace), ^--~. offerer (compare 
\^ friar), ^\^ flyer (compare ^--^ flower), \N\ hop-fly (compare 

<^^^ hopeful). 
Subject to the above: — 

(2) The " left " curves v_ V. are used if more convenient for 
joining than the " right " curves, as in J ~ tougher, '\j leverage, 

V. effervesce, °^s survivor. V. froth, v, usufruct, ^~v^ friable. 



N- freckle, ^^^ — frank. 



France. 



INTRODUCTION ^^d 

(3) In other cases the " right " curves \ A are generally used, 
as V' verbose, \ — ■■ Africa, j fresh, V-^ frame. 

(4) As regards thr and THr, ( ( are used initally when preceded 
by a vowel (i.e., as when standing alone) ; thus, V> Atherston, 
\f Atherley, \^ otherwise. 

(5) In other cases the " right " curves / / are used, as / thread, 
) thrive, \J thrash, J throttle, K tether, X zither, \ Arthur. 

(6) Preference is given to the " left " curves V_ v. ; thus, 
V. flabby, Vq flask, V_y flash, ^^ baffle, ^A shovel, 

V_ muffle. 

(7) The " left " curve (. is used initially, and the " right " curve 
) after ' another stroke; thus, S athletic, \/\ Ethelred, v\ Bethel, 

CT^ bismuthal. 

N (Stroke and Hook). 

(1) Words ending in -nian are generally written with the hook for 
the final n, even in the case of derivatives from words with outlines 
ending with hook n ; thus, .IVj. Etonian, -^--J C^ Hamiltonian, but 
note ^^ Gladstonian, TL* Augustinian, t>_i» Athenian, 

(2) Words ending in -n nt are generally written with hook n finally ; 
thus, V anent, 2S> assonant, lai? dissonant. Final -n nt preceded by 
p, stroke / or v, or m is, however, written with stroke nt finally ; thus, 
\y pennant, Ji, tenant, V4>J> convenient, I— ^^.j^-' dominant, as are also 
the words 'slys^ consonant and jaj.^^ sonant. 

(3) Words ending in -t n or -d n are generally written with the 
hook for the final « ; thus, ^ fatten, (/.]■ wheaten, p abandon. 

(4) The final n is, however, represented by the stroke in the following 
cases — 

(a) Words ending in -rt n or -; st n, e.g.,\/<-^ Spartan, f~>''^~> martin, 

ff-^ congestion. Compare \<J puritan, \^" baritone. 



INTRODUCTION 



(6) Most words ending in -ntine, e.g., "t turpentine, and also — 

(c) The words ^^.j-^ fountain, ^,^1^ mountain, ^-^ plantain, 
\J> pontoon, and '^;^^ bounden. 

N Preceded by Two Vowel-Sounds. 

Stroke n is used — (a) After a Triphone consisting of « and a vowel ; 

thus, c>-^ genuine, {j^ constituent, \/lsf pursuant. Compare /V\ lion, 

^ client, >) compliance, ^ fcMoyawcy, in which the « is preceded by 
other triphones. 1 

(fe) After two separate vowel-signs ; thus, Ljj triune. 

(c) In the words V-vn pioneer, L> giawi, '^^_-, buoyant, <f heroine, 

^^ ruin, and several words ending in fluent, e.g., V^^ fluent. 



mellifluent. Compare other words in which n occurs after a 
diphone, e.g., =2= crayon, —^ cayenne, i^J^ hygiene. 

Medial N. 

(1) In the absence of any special reason to the contrary, stioke n 
is used between p, b, t, d, ch or / and full-length t ox d ; thus, 
\^y|^ pantaloon, vJl bountiful, L_^yo tantalize, lL-i>- dental, 

'li^.. legendary. 

(2) But the hook is used between the same strokes and half-length 
t or d, unless the n is followed by a vowel ; thus, ^ painted, 

J daunted, J enchanted, J jointed, but ^-r:] penitent, 
"^•'^O, originated. 

(3) Hook n is used between --^ r and ^--' n in such words as 
v^ ■ barrenness, <^ • modernness, but stroke n is more convenient 

between o^ sf or c^ w and -^-^ « ; thus, 0/ sereneness, 

(T^ ' oneness. SimiUarly -^^^ roundness, but c/'^'''^ windiness. 

(4) Stroke n is generally retained in derivatives from words 
written with the stroke, other than those ending in -ic or -cy ; 
thus, ^v^^ funnier, Vik^ puniness ; but ^ >=— ^ euphonic, 
^o Vi" subservieru^y. 



INTRODUCTION yrfH 

Medial NS. 

(5) Stroke « is used medially before s or f, unless the hook is 
clearly more convenient; thus, </• r Wednesday, c/^^^ wainscot, 

A^^jy^ caravansary, but ./^^~^ ransom, A lonesome, ^^ Ironside. 

(6) Two hooks together are generally avoided ; hence v-^ plunger, 

A I ranger. They are, however, allowed in the words 1- kindred, 
/ manger, and one or two uncommon words, as well as certain 
compound words. 

(7) In Compound words hook n is often retained medially, even 
where it would be avoided in other words ; e.g., 'V-^ open-mouthed, 

Y--> penman, ^r>-^ mainmast, X n/ rainproof, ^t-r earthenware. 

F, V (Hook and Stroke). 

(1) Words ending in -tive (other than those which are contracted) 
are generally written with \, ; thus, y^\ receptive, 'k. inventive. 
Exceptions to the above are '' ^ captive, ^ plaintive, and such 
words as H- attentive and J digestive. 

(2) The stroke is used for / or t; occurring between p ox b (without 
an initial attachment) and t ov d ; thus, \, pivot, ^^^ buffet. After 

N or N , however, the hook is more convenient ; thus, \ private, 
N brevity. 

(3) Hook / or « is used between t, d or ch and t or dia derivatives 
as well as other words ; thus, ^\i sanctified, u Cheviot. Note — - 
L defied, \^ edified, L deified, for distinction. 

The Aspirate. 

(1) Tick h attached to half-length stroke st, is used in the following 
words — )X' history, V^ histrionic, l^htistings, \j? Hastings. 

(2) Downward h is used in a few cases to create a clear distinction 
of outline, as /^ heritor ( ■h'^a inheritor), /L^ heritable 



INTRODUCTION 



(3-*^^ inheritable), or to provide a more easily written form, as 

«r heritage. 

(3) Words beginning with hetero- axe written with ^ except 
before — ^-^ or 1 , when | is more convenient ; thus 

?>X_4. heterogeneous, XI n heterodox ; but "I ^ heterogamous, 

•l^.yVo heteromorphous, Y^l. heterology. 

(4) Compound words ending in -house are written as under — 
(a) With <r if convenient for joining, i.e., after />, 6, /, d, f or a 

straight upstroke ; thus, tyP chop-house, ^\j club-house, 
\i gate-house, vj^ coffee-house, c^i^ warehouse, <£f hothouse. 

, (6) With / after k, g, m or I ; thus, l_j) workhouse, (^ l^ loghouse, 
^£^ summer-house, CZ^ alehouse. 

(c) With stroke s when neither cT^ nor / will join well, i.e., 
after s, sA, n, ng, # circle or a hook ; also after ch, in which case 
stroke s is particularly facile ; thus, .jj alms-house, } ice-house, 
Y wash-house, \ pigeon-house, / coach-house. 

Upward and Downward R and L. 

(1) Words beginning with st {vowel) r followed by stroke n 
have upward r ; thus, .</ ' consternation, <^c\j sternutation, 
^^~X^^^' Stornoway. 

(2) Final r is written upward (among other cases) after kr, gr or Ik ; 



thus, c — ^ cn'cr, c:; — grower, (^ luckier : but downward after 5* 

or fk : thus, o N| obscure, V — fakir. 

(3) Final r in compounds, as in other words, is written 
upward after two downstrokes ; thus, I r, f> tax-gatherer, 
<^« shooting-star. 

(4) In words ending in -rest, -rist, -lest or -list the r or / is written 
upward or downward as when followed by a final vowel ; thus, 
Ny/^ barest, \^ fairest, \f fullest, 4 annalist. 



INTRODUCTION 



(5) Medial r is nearly always written downward before m : thus, 

\ barium, 'X-t emporium, ^—^ forum. After th, however, 
it is written upward ; thus, U<^ theorem. 

(6) Medial r is also written downward in most derivatives from 
words written with downward r ; thus, J declarable, /Si powerful. 



-^^''"' barely, ^^ h furrier, ^y maturely : but in words ending 
in -rial, -ral or -rhal upward r is used ; thus, »T^ armorial, 
/-jrvf mayoral, \/\ catarrhal. 

(7) Final' / after \ \ or t~ is written as after a ; thus, 

^jrr egotistical, (- methodistical, (*fl; / logistical. 

(8) L occurring finally, or with only a circle or loop following, is 
written downward after a half-length or double-length stroke if a more 
convenient outline is so obtained ; thus, '5^. completely, ^Z" shiftless, 
^v vividly, y^ wildly. \ — -^ pectoral. 

(9) Final / is written downward in compounds of words written 
with upward / if the upward form would be quite inconvenient for 

joining, as in ./ sand-eel, O train-oil, but the upward form is 

retained if at all practicable, as in \J port-hole, L i stock-list. 

(10) Medial I is written upward in > " biliousness and 
^ ' superciliousness, but downward in words ending in -lescence or 
-lescent ; e.g., y- opalescence, ^ coalescent. It is also written upward 

before <s~n whenever practicable ; thus, / realism, /-^^/ 
imperialism, but /-^ sensationalism, J^ naturalism. 

Upward and Downward SH. 

(1) Final sh is written downward after t or st : thus. ' j latish, 
I coquettish, 1 moustache. Exception — > „ brutish. 

(2) Final sh s is written upward after t, but downward after st; 
thus, ^-^ — j .„ fictitious, but '¥ superstitious. 



XXvl INTRODUCTION 

(3) The words \y mopish and " \y tnobbish are written with 
upward sh on the same principle as V/ brush. 

(4) Final sh after I is written downward, except in verbs in which 
the / is preceded by another consonant ; thus, ^ J milifiu, ^l J palish, 
(•_J lash, but \/' polish, C slash. 

(5) Final sh s is written downward after I ; thus r^\ delicious, 
btj' silicious. 

Compound Consonants. 

(1) Wl and whl in derivatives. 

(a) The compound consonant u or C is retained in the deriva- 
tives (past tenses, etc.), o I wailed, 'C^ I wallowed, (j \ wheeled, etc. 
(fc) Primitive words containing the consonants wld are written 

with t-^^ ; thus, o^ wild, <y^ weld, c/^ weald : although in some 
derivatives from these words the compound consonant is again 

employed, e.g., mC wilder, vo t wildest, L welded, u d wealden. 

(2) iff. The compound consonant A is not used after ; / ; hence 
cellarer. 




(3) Kw and mp, mb in Compound words. A consonant at the 
end of the first part of a compound word is not combined with a 
consonant beginning the second part ; hence b^V_^ silk-worm, 
dumb-bell, l'-^ tomboy. An exception to this is the word 

lukewarm. 
Halving Principle. 

(1) A stroke is not halved when a better outline is obtained bj 
means of the full t or d; thus, Ql . flotilla, r7 indulge, \^ integer 

{^^ interior. 

(2) Words ending in -tatory, -datory, -ditary, etc., are treated as 
follows — 

(a) In the case of the termination -tatory the last / is generally 
written in full ; thus, XF rotatory, ~\, excitatory, b j saltatory 



INTRODUCTION XXVii 

(6) When the termination is -datory, the halving principle is generally 
applied; thus, d^ hereditary, ^C consolidatory . 

(3) Words ending in -lively following stroke t or tr are written with 
full t : thus, vl authoritatively, n illustratively. 



(4) Words ending in -ctary, -ctory, -catory, -gatory, -ctarian, etc., 

are generally written with full / ; thus, t_i directory, 1 Tractarian. 

A better outline, however, is obtained by halving in such words as 



secretary, ,q-~rr mxgratory. 

(5) Words ending in -taceous, -titious and -dacious are written with 
full t or d ; thus, |x cretaceous, L*-< mendacious. 

(6) The more common words ending in -pid are written with half- 
length p : thus, l^ tepid, ^— ^ insipid ; but 

(7) Words ending in -pade, -ped, -pede or -pod are generally written 
with full d ; thus, i_^^^ escapade, \ centipede, l^ tripod. 

(8) Words ending in k (vowel) d are generally written with full d; 
thus, V-j arcade, ' \ naked, L — decoyed ; but half-length k is 

used in a few words of more than two syllables, e.g., \/ barricade, 
V cavalcade, and in the word /''^ rescued. 

(9) Words ending in ^ (vowel) /, however, are generally written 
with half-length g ; thus, V Mg<ite, L target, ^^r nugget (but 

' I iMg'Of, for distinction). 

(10) Stroke < or i is retained when convenient in the following 
classes of derivatives, viz. — 

(a) Words derived, either directly or indirectly, from primitive words 
with outlines containing stroke t or d and not more than one other 
stroke consonant ; e.g., ^ pitiful, > becloud, S:^:}. overrate. 



; e.g., J pitiful, > 



The following are exceptional — V beautify, \n beautiful, 
/^"^ written, ^^-^ writing. 

(6) Certain secondary derivatives from primary derivatives wTitten 
with stroke t or d, in which the stroke is retained for the purpose of 



INTRODUCTION 



distinction ; e.g., <^Vj> weightiness, \js greediness, ) >; heartily, 
nv Y 

^ flightiness. 

(c) In words ending in -tieth, in order to prevent the possibility of 
confusion between ^^^^ seventieth and ^^-^-i seventh, ^v fiftieth 
and ^x_^ fifth, etc, / / 

(11) In COMPOUNDS of words with outlines ending in stroke < or d 
that t ot d is generally expressed by halving ; thus, X^j" copyright, 

^ — sjr backbite, K ice-boat, ~^^ cow-hide, ~Tf- go-ahead, NX^ brush- 
wood. Stroke t or d is, however, retained after one half-length stroke, 
as in ^ tit-bit, \ catboat, and also in a few other cases in which 
the full t or d gives a more distinct outline, e.g., /^ A rosewood, 
r\ jolly-boat. 

(12) In COMPOUNDS of words commencing with t or d, that t or d 
is not expressed by halving ; thus, U-, time-table, ^ grave- 



digger, ' ^1 quarter-deck. Exceptions — cr-i^ sometimes and 
N>^ beforetime. 

(13) Final // is written downward after v_i> ; thus, ^^ insult, 
* ^ cancellate, <o^ Hunslet. 

(14) With regard to final rd. the forms ^^veered, \ persevered, 

etc., are adopted because, although not strictly in accordance with 
the rule, they are quite distinct and more convenient than the 
possible alternatives v/'. ^., etc. On the other hand, in such 
words as geared, __^ is a better form than ^, wliidi latter would 
become indistinct in practice. 

(15) The upward r is only used finally for Id in words ending in 
■led Sitter \ \ ) or T. e.g., ^— y- furled, "^ frilled, j-" thrilled, 

\r belittled, and in the word r-^ scheduled; it is also used medially in 
<->^ mildly and -^-^^^^ mildness. In other cases the separate / I 
is written if r is not convenient ; thus, f\ assailed, ^ I muzzled, 
tf^ • household. 



INTRODUCTION XXix 

Doubling Principle. 

(1) The doubling principle is not applied in words ending in- lateral 
and -literal, double-length / being used only in words in which it 

occurs finally and in words derived from these ; thus, C r laten 
(compare C latterly), \/' ' pluriliteral, X t poulterer 

(compare ^ slaughterer), ri. liturgy (compare (^ ' lighterage). 

(2) When the vowel in the termination tor is sounded distinctly, 
as in the legal terms '^ grantor, VjjT vendor, r— "^^^ guarantor, 
the doubling principle is not applied. 

(3) The doubling principle is applied in a few cases although there 
is a strongly-sounded vowel between t and r : e.g., ^ — < material, 
Vi^' — '■ enteric, \t__;_^ — ; dysenteric, L^^^ tartaric. 

(4) The doubling principle is also applied in the following cases, 
notwithstanding that there is no vowel between the t or d and the r — 



(a) Several words containing central, centri- or -centric, e.g., 7 central, 
■(j_^_^ — = concentric, -^-"^^-i-x^ — '■ eccentric, \- r> centrifugal. 

(b) i theatrical, 6 cylindric. 

(5) Words ending in -erate or -orate, although derived from words 
written with a double-length stroke, are written by means of the halving 
principle (i.e., in the same way as past tenses such as "^ centred) ; 
thus, i—^. directorate, y^'' stadtholderate. 

(6) The doubling principle is not applied when tr is preceded by a 
diphthong and a long vowel ; thus, t_/i extenuator, n— i punctuator. 
Compare x^ proprietor, ^\ radiator. '\ 

(7) Joining of Strokes of Unequal Length. Paragraph 14(5 of the 
Instructor applies to double-length as well as hail-length strokes. 
Double-length n, however, is sufficiently distinct after t or downward / / 
thus, L detonator, C. > alienator. 

(8) Double-length I is written upward", except after ng, ns or sk ; 
thus, Vy filter, \i\ beholder, __/ gilder, but '/^ ringleader. 
Y insulter, "F' scolder, { f helter-skelter. 



XXX INTRODUCTION 

(9) Double-length strokes may be used in such compound words 



as the following — ^~v backbiter, L — ^ — chaff-cutter, ^ muzzle- 
loader. \ 

Vocalization of Double Consonants. 

(1) Medial r preceded by a strongly-sounded vowel is generally 
represented by separate r unless a hooked form is necessary in order 

to avoid an awkward or a too lengthy outline ; thus /-''^ ulterior, 
^ internal, '^\/f fraternal. 

(2) Words ending in -torial are generally written with separate r, 
but the hooked form is used in a few cases to avoid an awkward or 
a very lengthy outUne ; thus, I y- tutorial, [^ equatorial, 

q—\,y piscatorial, but /^\/y' reportorial, \_n <. spectatorial , 



•v 



dictatorial. 



(3) Words ending in -tarium, -torium, etc., are generally written with 
the hooked tr; thus, ' l^-,^ cometarium, <r^'t-~i moratorium, 

y auditorium. 

(4) Words ending in -chord are written with half-length kr ; thus, 
Ij. tetrachord, o-^-^ monochord. 

(5) Words ending in -jorm are written with the hooked form, ^ 
or \ , after | I / v / ^ ^~^ ^~^ or / ; thus, A. i stalacti- 

form, v^ spongiform, J aciform, \t>v curvi/orm, 

V— ^s. vermiform. In other cases separate r is used ; thus, 

napiform, ^p-n. cuneiform, yr^^^^ metalliform, 

variform. 

(6) The following words ending in -culate or -gulate are wiitten with 
half-length hi ox gl, f— c_n calculate, t^-" speculate, </' gesticulate, 

/ J^„ reticulate, •/'^ articulate, c/^ circulate, ^-^/^ matriculate, 
.;y-<^n coagulate, /^ regulate. 




INTRODUCTION XXXi 

(7) The prefix for- is represented by V. or, when this is inconvenient, 
by ^ ; thus, Vo.!. forsake, "X? / forbear, but ^-r-i forget. This does 
not apply to the prefix fore-, which should be written with separate 
r (downward in preference) when convenient ; thus ^-~^ forecast, 

\/ ' forenoon, ^-^ foresight (compare V^ ferocity) ; otherwise the 



hooked form is used ; thus, V^ foretell, <Jf foreshorten, ^*~z^ forewarn. 

J' 
(8) Compound words endinp in -bird and -board are written with 

the half-length br whenever convenient ; thus, r jailbird, 

mocking-bird, \ — fx blackboard, vC switchboard. But note 

keyboard, and \j pasteboard. 



Abbreviated W and Joined WAW. 

The abbreviated form of the consonant w is conveniently retained 
in a few compounds of " woman," e.g., 4,^ needlewoman, ^Z} char- 
woman : but J' as a joined diphthong is not retained medially as 
part of an outline ; hence /^^ rainwater, 'V soda-water, jL churchwarden. 

Suffixes. 

(1) With reference to -ing, the stroke is quite convenient after 
(/ or J ; thus, v^ chaining, -l^ enjoining. Stroke ng is also used 
after I , although it does not give a very convenient joining, as the 
dot might be mistaken for a vowel-sign ; thus, oXi utilizing, 

/^ releasing. 

(2) When adding -ing, the outline of the original word is almost 
invariably left unaltered ; thus, Vv fancying, d^ freezing, 

'^-r-o. cleansing, V failing, V. piercing, ^- shelling, ^\ rating. 

Exceptions to this are O losing, O- lacing, etc., (_^ ailing, 
^ coalescing, S- convalescing, and /">->■ writing. 

(3) When the outline of the present tense ends with a joined diph- 
thong, the latter is not retained if stroke ^^ can be joined ; thus, 
/ renewing, \/\j^ pursuing, \^ bowing. 



XXXii INTRODUCTION 

(4) -ality, -ility, -arity, etc., are expressed by means of a disjoined 
stroke in the great majority of cases, including practically all of the 
large number of words ending in -bility. The words which are written 
in full include — 

{a) Words ending in -ally, -iality, or -iorily, if the full outline is 

quite convenient ; thus, \_^ penalty, fi. cordiality, \y^l partiality, 

\iz, veniality, ^-^ j5| inferiority. 

(b) Words in which the full outline is particularly facile, especially 
after a half-length stroke; e.g., "^ [ fertility, 'yl, austerity, 
<~^.\. maturity, S:— ; verticality, c^ personality. 

(c) Words in which the -ality, etc., is preceded by only one stroke 
or by s or shun ; thus, ^:'^'^ " hilarity, ^* J. facility, s^'iJ.l nationality. 

{d} In a few cases for the purpose of distinction ; e.g., </\ juniority 

(^/^ geniality), (^° j. locality (' — legality), ^ /l disparity 
( b\ disability) . 

(e) \o compatibility, V .1. accessibility and a lew other 

miscellaneous words. 

(5) -ment is represented by ■^ after -,-^ -^ Vo or ^~_p, or a hook 
to which the full form .tt. cannot conveniently be jonied ; thus, 
•ci_^-^ consignment, ^» preferment, ^<.c^ effacement, v^o^ commence- 
ment, ^^ enchantment, X>- pavement. When ^^ can be made 
convenient, it is often written in preference to the contracted form ; 
thus, y^^" discernment, /Vn rescindment, |^ amendment. 

(6) The sufl&x .^ may be joined when occurring after full-length 
^-^ r, - — n or s-^ ng, also, when convenient, after a hook (the preced- 
ing part of the outline remaining unaltered) ; thus. <iiJ>v censorship, 

\^ companionship, ^ friendship, X^ relationship. -Ship is 
written in full after I /, as in V/V fellowship; also in j heirship. 

(7) Disjoined ^ may be used in compound and other words in 
which -ship is not grammatically a suffix ; thus, j> battleship, 
'^As midshipman, ^ lightship. 



INTRODUCTION XXXiil 

(8) -fulness is represented by the disjoined suffix v^ except in 
j-v delightfulness, a^ doubtfulness and \n beautifulness. 
^-v^ ^-v^ ^-^^ 

Grammalogues. 

(1) Derivatives and compounds from grammalogues are written 
by retaining the logograrri (unvocalized) in the outline whenever a 

convenient and legible form is so obtained ; thus c_^^^ golden, 

St.... thankless, L deliverer, U . advantageous, 4 would-be, 
^ twofold. ' 

\ 

(2) In DERIVATIVES and compounds of " eye the logogram is 

not abbreviated ; hence \if eyelet, y/ J eyelid. 

Contractions. 

Derivatives and compounds from contracted words are written 
by retaining the original contraction in the outline whenever a con- 
venient and legible form is so obtained ; thus, J^ disorganize, 
B— < distinguishable, A thank-off mng. 

Derivative Words. 

The derivation of words must be regarded as one of a number of 
considerations affecting the choice of outlines, but wliile in the outlines 
of many derivatives the outline of the primitive word, or some par- 
ticular feature of it, is retained, there are, on the other hand, many 
cases in which derivatives are written in accordance with the ordinary 
rules and principles of the system, without regard to derivation ; e.g., 

V--, remove, ^""^ remover ; \| bitter, \ embitter ; l hawk, 

<j^ hawker ; f ail, fC^ ailment ; ^ royal, ^ royalist. 

Words described as " derivatives " are taken to include any words 
that are apparently derived from other English words. 

In the above notes, attention is dra^vn by means of capitals to the 
treatment of certain classes of derivative and compound words. 



Derivatives Anticipated. 

In certain cases, including some verbs previously mentioned, 
words are written in a particular way so that tlieir outlines may agree 

with those of derivatives formed from them, e.g., <^ wanton, 

*\ / waiuoniy ; ' Jj— ' clandestine, ^^j^ clandestinely; 



XXXIV INTRODUCTION 

: \ captive, '"A captivate ; "| exist, ~J existence : j sister, 
1 sisterly ; ^ scientific, Cy scientifically. 

Compound Words. 

A number of classes of compound words have already been dealt 
with in connection with the various principles involved. With regard 
to cases in which the outlines of the primary words will not join con 
veniently, they are written disjoined if a better outline is not obtainable 
by altering one or both of them so as to admit of joining. 

Disjoining. 

(1) Disjoining is not resorted to if a better outline can other- 
wise be obtained ; thus, I — . tactics, (" I locate, \^ densely, 

y^ / rearrange, but i*;^ steadfast, ^^-^^ySk mentionable, (j^ deaf-mute, 
\) spendthrift. 

(2) Three straight strokes that would not make an angle are not 
joined together : hence \ --r picture-gallery. 

(3) Outlines in which one at least of three strokes is a curve are 
generally allowable although there is no angle ; thus, X. papacy, 
' 3N_ clockwork ; but the combination / \ is avoided. I 

(4) Sometimes an angle is shown in order to make a joining allowable ; 
thus, y escheat, ^k Hebraized. 

(5) More than two successive downstrokes are avoided in such 
words as L top-boots, /IC red-tapism, ^ \| quarter-deck. 

Compare \ copy-book, .L seed-time, U^^ tea-dealer, in which 

there are only two downstrokes. 

Outlines and Vowels. 

Outlines, as a rule, are not varied in order to permit of a vowel- 
sign being placed exactly in its proper place ; thus, fa^ legislation, 
/^ ceaseless, l J ingeniously, \s>j^ appropriately, ^^_/- meanwhile. 



In a few cases, however, in which an outline that can be more 
accurately vocalized is a better one from a practical point of view, it 

is adopted, e.g., Ja doubtless, -^x unsoiled. 



INTRODUCTION 



Special Outlines. 



It will be recognised that there are many pairs or groups of words 
which, from their meaning, are liable to clash, and every precaution 
is necessary in such Ccises to avoid the risk of confusion. In a great 
majority of cases the application of the ordinary rules of the system 
affords adequate means of distinction, but in a comparatively few of 

these pairs of words, such as V^ favoured, ^-=>. favourite ; 1 Austra- 
lian, vly-^ Australasian, which otherwise would be written with 

the same or a very similar form, a special outline is adopted for one of 
them in order to provide a clear distinction. Again, in a few instances, 

such as ^ affidavit, "y oxyhydrogen, L-^ tartaric, 'ijyf sincerely, 

it has been found advisable, in order to secure the most con- 
venient outline, to adopt a form which is not capable of being fully 
vocalized, or which is not written in accordance with the usual practice. 
A list of these special outlines, in addition to those contained in the 
list of Distinguishing Outlines in the Instructor, is given below. It 
should be borne in mind that such outUnes, except in the case of some 
derivatives from the words in question, must not necessarily be 
regarded as models for the formation of other outlines.

Proper Names. 

In connection with these the pronunciation has -been checked from 
the Century Cyclopedia of Proper Names, the Standard Dictionary 
and other sources ; and a number of peculiarly pronounced and other 
names have been added. It should be remembered that proper 
names have frequently more than one accepted pronunciation. In 
some instances there is a local and also an " outside " pronunciation, 
and in the case of foreign names some have an anglicized pronunciation 
while others are given a native pronunciation only. From the short- 
hand point of view some proper names require special consideration, 
and the following observations will serve to indicate the practice 
which has been adopted in various groups of words — 

(1) When the nses circle is used, the vowel is understood to be S : 
it is therefore necessary to write stroke n and the ses circle when 
another vowel occurs, as in ' / Albigenses, ^C \i^ Waldenses. 

(2) Proper names ending in -ley preceded by the sound of k are 
generally written with the hooked letter ; thus, \ Brockley, 
^ Hinckley. 

(3) Words ending in -shire are generally written with the hooked 
letter shr (downward or upward as in other words) ; thus, \ Ayrshire, 

N/LjSi/ Aberdeenshire. 

(4) Words ending in -ford are generally written with the haJf-Iength 
hooked letter ( <l or ^ ) ; thus, ^"^ Catford, '~^ Oxford. The 
separate v,^ however is used after ^-^ ^.i^ etc., as in ^"V^ Swinford, 

K. Cinderford. 

(5) The hooked letter ^ is used for the terminations -boro, -burgh, 
-bury, when it is more convenient than the separate b-r, including 
cases in which it occurs after t, d, m, ms, I, Is : thus, L/ Attleborough, 

v->c>^ Flamborough, ^""W. Bloomsbury, r ^ Tilbury, 

'/^- Halsbury. 

(6) Proper names ending in -ton or -don are treated in the same 
way as other words having those terminations (see page xxi) ; thus, 

^T~v/vi/ Merton, \^Ts.y^--^ Pemberton, ^^ Clifton, p Bandon. 

J- J- 



XXXVIU INTRODUCTION 

(7) Words ending in -field are generally written with ^ , but after 
I ox I hook / is used ; thus, \~ Duffield, but 'J. Lichfield, 

L Sedgfield. 

(8) In the majority of words ending in -ham the h issilent, e.g., 
^^-— ^ Clapham, )^-^ Seaham, J ^_^ Ashburnham, Totten- 
ham, \h^ Rotherham. Doubtful cases include names of more 
than two syllables ending in -ingkam, such as Birmingham, Nottingham, 
but in these cases the aspirate is inserted. There are also a number 
of names ending in -sham or -tham in which custom has sanctioned 
the sound of sh and th respectively, e.g., \ Horsham, v_^. Evesham, 
n6 C-— . Waltham, ^-y- Bentham, though in others the s or / sound is 

retained, e.g., I Topsham, f Cheetham, .i-^ Greatham. 



(9) The h in the termination -hurst is generally represented by the 
dot ; thus, (^"yw Lyndhurst, y,/^-^^"'^ Billingshurst. In a few instances, 
however, it is disregarded in order to obtain a more convenient outline, 

e.g., \».?^ Pankhurst, \/' Parkhursf 

(10) After k the terminations -wall, -well, are most conveniently 

written with of'; thus c z^ Kirkwall. > — ^^ Bakewell. After 

upward I, however, (^ is sufficiently convenient ; as y^ Holywell. 

(11) When the vowel in the termination -ville is sounded distinctly, 
the separate / is written if convenient ; thus, V Sackville, 

^<. Granville, but rv^ Nashville. 

(1 2) The termination -gate is written with full t : thus, 
v^. Vr-i Bishopsgate, i__i_, Deansgate, ^^ Cripplegate. 

(13) -wood, however, is generally written with half-length w : thus, 
J/^ Attwood, — ..je^v Kingswood. Exception, ^' A Hey wood, to 

distinguish from <i<^ Hayward. 



(14) Words having the termination -worth are written with c^ ^'^ 
thus, }y^\ Saddleworth, \\\ Nailsworth : or when necessary 
to avoid an awkward or too lengthy outline, with '^ vocalized 
with wu : thus, c;:^^^''^^ Wandsworth, ^VA Wordsworth. 



INTRODUCTION XXxiX 

(15) In words ending in -ing, the dot is used after \ or c^^ or 
after r following another stroke ; thus, \ Epping, <<\. Wapping, 
\ Spalding, W>' Twining. In other cases stroke ^ is written ; 
thus, Tooting, \^^ Kettering, /^ij> Hutchings, \^ Harding, 
•^j) Jennings, >/ Behring. 

(16) In proper names p is not omitted when it occurs between m 
and t or m ajid sh : e.g., ^ Hampstead ( ^^ Hamstead), 

Y Ampthill, ' J Compton, /-^ Assumption, y Hampshire. 



(17) Proper names having their origin in words which are gramma- 
logues are generally written in accordance with the original outlines, 
but the logogram may be vocalized ; thus P Child, 2^ Short, 
^\ Wordsworth, 1 Seaforth, i— a* Seaman (compare ^ Seymour), 
A. Highbury. ( 

(18) In several place names such as ^~ Kingston-on-Thames, 
>L Strat ford-on- Avon, ^^ ^ Bur ton-on- Trent, J"* Clacton-on- 
Sea, aQ. Southend-on-Sea the preposition may be omitted. 

(19) The following are so written in order to obtain an easy or dis- 
tinct outline — of\ Sural, r^ Shetland, \. Thetford, Dudley, 

/ Jedburgh, ^ Ushant, {^j^ London, - — -^J Carruthers, V Sutherland, 
>» <^ Young. 

Distinguishing Outlines. 

The following distinguishing outlines should be noted — ^ Francis,

(a) All grammalogues and contractions are printed in italic; also 
any portions of derivative or compound words for which logograms or 
contractions are retained. 

(6) Only logograms and contractions (and their derivatives when 
the primitive forms are retained) occupying a first or a third position 
have their positions shown by a dotted line. 

(c) Capitals are employed initially only where such is the ordinary 
usage, as in the case of proper names and terms. In botanical, 
zoological, and similar scientific terms, the names of genera are 
capitahzed; with species bearing the same name a capital would not, 
of course, be used. For example. Ranunculus, the genus; but 
ranunculus, a plant of this genus.
