It would have been pleasing, indeed, to have finished without 
error, but perfection need not be expected of imperfection. If there 
are not more serious errors than here pointed to, we shall have 
cause to be glad. 



In Part III, Chap. 4, Art. 1, subject, "Christopher Harris," ap- 
pears the statement that "Two of his sons married 'daughters' ", 
when it should read " 'sisters' of the old pioneer, Higgason Grubbs." 
(See Supplement.) 

In Part III, Chap. 6, Art. 1, subject, "Robert Harris," it is stated 
that "he married Nancy Grubbs, a 'daughter' ", when it should read 
" 'sister' of Higgason Grubbs." (See Supplement.) 

In Part III, Chap. 12, Art. 1, subject, "Christopher Harris" 
(Rev.), the statement that he "married Elizabeth Grubbs, a 
'daughter' ", should read " 'sister' of Higgason Grubbs." (See 
Supplement.) 

In Part III, Chap. 3, Sec. 4, Sub-sec. 5, subject, "Lucy Harris," 
it appears that the subject, "Lucy Harris, married Thomas Grubbs, 
who in 1758 was in actual service against the Indians on the Vir- 
ginia frontier," when the fact is, she married Higgason Grubbs, 
who came from Albemarle County, Virginia, to Kentucky among 
the early pioneers. (See Supplement.) 

In the Supplement appended additional matter relative to fam- 
ilies of this history will be found, which is divided into 9 para- 
graphs — ^the head-lines thereto indicate the subject matter of each 
paragraph, w^hich is not otherwise indexed.

PREFACE. 



In the pages following, besides giving the lines of descent aS 
far back as traced, are brief narratives, sketches, etc., of individual 
members of the families of Miller, Woods, Harris, Wallace, Maupin, 
Oldham, Kavanaugh, Brown, an~d others. The lineage running back 
to one Miller, of Anglo-Scotch-Irish-Franco-German blood; Woods, 
an English Trooper of Scoth-Irish blood; Maupin, a Frenchman; 
Harris of Whales; Overt'on, an English soldier; Wallace, of the 
Scottish Clan Wallace (Scotch-Irish); Dabney, of French origin; 
Kavanaugh, from Ireland; Oldham, Angio-Welsh, and Brown, of 
English ancestry. By intermarrige these several bloods have inter- 
mingled and coursed into the veins of people who today are a promi- 
nent part of tihe best citizenship of our great country, and have all 
along, in the years gone by, held, and are now occupying, high 
positions of public trust in the body politic, and in the counsels of 
the nation their influences are felt, as well as filling prominent 
places in the marts of trade and commerce and agriculture and 
every otherwise, and have spread to the remotest i)ortions of 
the globe. 

Among the early mothers ap^pear the names of Lynn, Worsop, 
Campbell, Overton, Walters, Clairbourne, Glenn, Anderson, McCord, 
Bratton, Rice, Mullens, and others of whom very little more than 
the mere name is known, and sometimes hardly that because the 
lines have not been run out — -made very difficult to trace from the 
fact, as it seems, that the heads of the house pretty generally have 
been slow and careless in the making, preserving and handing down 
full and complete family records, and often when this was done rea- 
sonably well, by some mishap the same were lost or destroyed. 
Therefore, in many, if not most instances, only very meagre accounts 
can be obtained, especially of the maternal line, and often the little 
gathered does not satisfy, but only produces a desire to know more 
— there seems to he no stopping place. 

The data at hand has been gotten from old family and court 
records, letters and testimony of creditable persons, and from every 
source considered reliable, within reach, by long and patient search 
and labor. An endeavor has been made to put the facts together 
in a clear and comprehensive shape. No doubt some errors occur, 
and should be noted and corrected when detected. In a work of 
this kind perfection need not be expected. All matters set forth as 
facts are known or believed to be true from substantial evidence. 

The work is submitted to the liind and charitable judgment of 
the families and friends, and pardon is asked for shortcomings and 
imperfections. It is confidently hoped that the presentation may 
be interesting enough to cause some, at least, to overlook the faults, 
and that some good may result. 

This book is divided into eight parts, and each part into chap- 
ters, and the chapters into sections, for convenience and easy refer- 
ence. A genealogical table precedes each part.. ,y.^

Article 1 — Kentucky and Madison County Items. 

One of the three counties into which Fincastle County, Virginia, 
was divided, December 31, 1776, was Kentucky County, and Col. 
Richard Calloway and Col. John Todd were elected the first repre- 
sentatives of Kentucky County in the Virginia General Assembly. 
Afterwards Col. John Miller, Gen. Green Clay, Squire Boom, and 
Col. William Irvine, living in what was afterwards and is now Mad- 
ison County, were members of the Virginia General Assembly from 
Kentucky County. 

In May, 1780, the said county was divided and established into 
the three counties of Jefferson, Fayette and Lincoln. 

In October, 1784, the part of Jefferson south of Salt River was 
established and named as the County of Nelson. 

May 1. 178.5, Bourbon County was formed out of the northern 
part of Fayette County. 

August 1, 1785, out of Lincoln the counties of Madison and 
Mercer were carved (the county of Madison then embracing a much 
larger territory than it does at this day), extending and taking in 
the Goose Creek waters. Clay and many other eastern and southern 
counties. 

May 1, 1788, Mason was carved out of Bourbon, and Woodford 
out of Favette, making at this date nine counties into which the 
original Kentucky County had been carved, which comprised the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky, when admitted into the Union as a 
State, June 1, 1792, with General Isaac Shelby, of Danville, her 
first Governor; James Brown, Secretary of State: John Logan, 
Treasurer, and George Nicholas. Attorney General: her constitution 
at that time made no provision for a Lieutenant Governor. 



20 Histori/ and Genealogies 

The first village of Kentucky, and the only one within its bor- 
ders prior to the settlement at Harrodsburg in 177 4-5, was in 
what is now Greenup County, opposite the mouth of the Scioto 
River, built by the Shawanee Indians and some French traders years 
before the French War in 17 53, where in 1805 stood the little vil- 
lage of Alexandria, about a mile below where Portsmouth, Ohio, is. 
In 1773, this Indian village consisted of about twenty log cabins 
with roofs, doors, windows and chimneys made of clap-boards, and 
some cleared ground around them. 

Kentucky was the hunting ground of the northern and southern 
tribes of Indians on which different tribes often met and tried their 
rights in deadly combat. The six nations north of the Ohio River: 
the Mohawks, Tuscaroras, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and 
Senecas, with the dependant or sub-tribes: the Shawanees, the Del- 
ewares, the Mingos, the Wyandotts, and others, and the tribes south 
of Kentucky: the Cherokees, the Chickasaws, and others, claimed 
Kentucky as their Hunting Ground, and not only fought one an- 
other, but harassed the white settlers for years, till about the year 
179 3. After this year there were only occasionally a te^v lurking, 
skulking marauders spying through the interior settlements. 

At different periods from 1747 to 1772, Kentucky was visited 
by various parties of white men, adventurers and hunters, but the 
first that gave any promise of actual, permanent settlement and im- 
provement was in 177 3, when a large number of surveys were made. 

Kentucky being the Hunting and Battle Ground of the various 
tribes of Indians was called the Dark and Bloody Ground. 

The first fort in Kentucky was erected March 2 6, 1775, in what 
was afterwards and is now Madison County, about five miles south 
of the present city of Richmond, and a little over a mile in a south- 
west direction from Estill's old station, on a small branch of Tay- 
lor's Fork, and about a quarter of a mile west of Hart's Fork of 
Silver Creek, upon a little elevated ground, about one hundred yards 
from Bossie's Trace, and called Twetty's or the Little Fort. It was 
built of logs in a square, six or seven feet high, the day after the 
attack made by the Indians before the break of day upon the com- 
panies of Colonel Daniel Boone and Captain William Twetty, as a 
protection against further surprises and sudden attacks of the In- 
dians. The wounded. Captain Twetty, who had been shot in both 
knees, and young Felix Walker, were removed into the fort and 
there nursed, and the third day after receiving the wound in said 
battle, and the second day after the fort was built. Captain Twetty 
died, and his body was buried inside the fort. A portion of the 
company remained at the fort to nurse Walker until April 6, 1775, 
when he was well enough to be moved, and was taken to Boones- 
borough, which latter fort, although commenced was not completed 
until June 14, 1775. 

For several years Twetty's, or the Little Fort, was one of the 
best known and most noted places in what is now Madison County. 

Boones Fort, or Boonesborough, was the second fort built and 
the first station fortified, and where Colonel Daniel Boone and his 
company arrived April 1, 1775, which fort was completed .lune 
14, 1775. 

William Bush, Jesse Oldham, Rev. Joseph Proctor, Peter Hackett 
and ten other men in their depositions describe the Indian attack 
and the Little Fort above mentioned. 

Harrodsburg is reputed to be the oldest town in the State built 
by white settlers. 

In order of formation, Madison County was the seventh, and 



nisi (in/ mill <lriiciil(H/ics 21 

was carved out of Lincoln, and was established by act of the General 
Assembly of Virginia in 17S5: the first court was organized and 
held by Justices of the Peace, holding commissions from Patrick 
H(>nry, Govci'nor of Virginia, August 22, 1786, at the house of 
George Adams, and the first court house was erected at the place 
where Captain David Gass' path leaves the Great Road, near Tay- 
lor's Fork of Silver Creek; and it is claimed by some that the work 
was done under contract by Villiam Golden, son-in-law of Daniel 
Maupin, Sr., (who died in Madison County in 180:5). Mr. Golden 
lived to be 110 years old ana died just about the beginning of or 
a short time before the Civil War. 

This court house, or county seat, was called Milford, or Old 
Town. In 1798 the county seat was removed to Ridiniond, where 
the first settlement and improvement of the place had been made 
by Colonel .Tohn Miller, who granted 50 acres for the town, which 
was surveyed and laid off into lots and streets by the surveyor, .John 
Crooke. (See Part I, Chapter 1.) 

At the residence of Colonel Charles Robertson, at the Sycamore 
Shoals, on the Watanga, a tributary to the Holston River, on March 
17, 1775, a treaty known as the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the 
chief warrior Oconostoto and other prominent chiefs, towit: Atacul- 
lacullah (or Little Carpenter) and Savanooko (or Coronoh) of the 
Overhill Cherokee Indians, was consummated by nine gentlemen 
from Granville and adjoining counties of North Carolina, towit: 
Colonel Richard Henderson, .John Litterell, Nathaniel Hart, Thomas 
Hart, David Hart, William Johnston, John Williams, James Hogg, 
and Leonard Hendley Bullock, to whom, for 10,000 pounds lawful 
money of Great Britain, were deeded a large portion of the beauti- 
ful, fertile lands of Kentucky, between the Cumberland and the 
Kentucky (Chenoco or Louisa) Rivers, not less than seventeen mil- 
lion acres, which company was called the Henedrson Company, 
afterwards the Transylvania Company, or Colony, making them pro- 
prietors of a magnificent territory, and they organized a form of 
government for their colony called the Transylvania, and the House 
of Delegates, or representatives of this colony, assembled May 23, 
1775, under a large spreading elm tree, at Boonesborough, on the 
Kentucky River, and held, on what is Madison County soil, the first 
legislative meeting west of the Allegheny Mountains. 

After heated contest in the court and before the Virginia Gen- 
eral Assembly, the treaty and government organization of this col- 
ony was nullified but a considerable tract of land was granted the 
company by the Virginia General Assembly. 

Boonesborough was established as a town by act of said As- 
sembly of Virginia in October 1779; twenty acres had already been 
laid off into lots and streets and fifty acres more directed to be 
so laid off, and five hundred and seventy acres, the balance of a 
section, were to be laid off for a common called Lick Common. 

The first trustees appointed, Richard Calloway, Charles Minn 
Thruston, Levin Powell, Edmund Taylor, James Estill, Edward 
Bradley, John Kennedy, David Gass, Pemberton Rollins, and Daniel 
Boone, gentlemen, refused to act, and by act of 1787, Thomas Ken- 
nedy, Aaron Lewis, Robert Rodes, Green Clay, Archibald Woods, 
Benjamin Bedford, John Sappington, William Irvine, David Crews 
and Higgason Grubbs, gentlemen, were made trustees of the town. 

The historic elm under which the first legislative council was 
held, and under which the first sermon preached in Kentucky was 
delivered, stood on the Lick Commons, and was. in about 1S2N, cut

down foi- its wood by the servants of Samuel Holley — a very un- 
thoughtful piece of work. 

From its incipiency Boonesborough was the main object of In- 
dian hostilities. Three days after it was begun — on the 6th of 
April, 177 5 — the Indians killed a white man of the fort. Decem- 
ber 24, 1775, they killed another and wounded one. April 15, 
1777, a simultaneous attack was made on Boonesborough, Harrods- 
burg and Logan's Fort by a large number of Indian warriors, in 
which Boonesborough suffered the loss of some men, some corn and 
some cattle, but the Indians were forced to retire. July 4 of the 
same year the fort was again attacked with fury, but without suc- 
cess, by about two hundred warriors; this seige lasted two days 
and nights. August 8, 177 8, a third siege was made by five hun- 
dred armed and painted Indian warriors, led by Canadian officers, 
with the display of British colors, and a surrender of the fort de- 
manded. At about the same time twenty-five Wyandotts made an 
attack on Estill's Station, and were chased by Col. Estill and his 
men, and led to the bloody battle of Little Mountain, near where 
Mount Sterling is, where Col. Estill and several of his men were 
killed and a number wounded. 

In August, 179 2, seven Indians made an attack on the dwelling 
house of Mr. Stephenson, in Madison County but were finally re- 
pulsed. Mr. Stephenson was badly wounded. 

The last Indian incursion into the county of Madison was in 
179 3. After this date there were only a few prowling Indian thieves 
and vagabonds. 

The Long Hunter's Road led from Pepper's Ferry, on New River, 
in Virginia, to Rockcastle River in Kentucky, distance 316 miles. 
The Wilderness Road, from Philadelphia through the Valley of 
Virginia and Cumberland Gap, to the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville, 
Ky. ) , distance 826 miles, or 208 miles from Cumberland Gap onto 
the waters of Dick's River to the Falls, the great traveled road 
from Virginia to Kentucky, through Cumberland Gap, Hazel Patch, 
Crab Orchard, and Logan's Fort, to Danville, Harrodsburg and other 
interior settlements in Kentucky. 

Boone's Trace was cut from the Long Island on the Holston 
River, not far from the place of Treaty of Fort Stanwix, at the 
Sycamore Shoals on the Watanga, a branch of the Holston, to 
Boonesborough, on the Kentucky (Louisa) River, by Colonel Daniel 
Boone under a bargain with the proprietors of the Transylvania or 
Henderson Company, to go before and open the road (23 3 miles). 

At Big Moccasin Gap the three roads, the Long Hunter's Path, 
the Wilderness Road, and Boone's Trace, came together and con- 
tinued the same to the Hazel Patch; here Boone's Trace branched 
off northward, through Boone's Gap in the Big Hill, to Boones- 
borough. 

The Warrior's Path, traveled by the Indians through the Hunt- 
ing Ground, traversed Kentucky from the villages of the southern 
tribes, across the Cumberland Mountains at its southern boundary 
near the mouth of Buffalo Creek, branching to the northern villages. 
Old Shawnee Town near the mouth of the Scioto River, the Mingo 
nation crossing the Ohio at the mouth of Cabin Creek, a fork taking 
down the Licking to its mouth, crossing there the Ohio to the Great 
and Little Miami towns, and other points in the northwest. 

In the interesting and perilous pioneer days many of the immi- 
grants from Virginia and North and South Carolina traveled these 
roads — the Wilderness, the Long Hunter's Path, and Boone's Trace. 
Others from Pennsylvania and northeasterly parts came down the 



I/isldii/ mill (iciicdhjijics 33 

Monongahela and Ohio Rivers to Lees Town, the Falls of the Ohio 
and other roints; thence different routes to the interior.

The Dunmore war resulted in a treaty of peace with the six 
nations of Indians north of the Ohio, in which the Indians surren- 
dered all claim to Kentucky. But on account of renegade Indians 
and traitorous whites, who unscrupulously violated the terms of 
peace, it was difficult to enforce the treaty with all the faithful 
efforts of the leading spirits on both sides of the question. 

Colonel Daniel Boone was Deputy Surveyor of Madison County, 
Kentucky. In 17 88 Aaron Lewis and William Calk were appointed 
by the court to examine Daniel Boone touching his capacity to 
execute the office of Deputy surveyor of Madison County, Kentucky.

well and John Kennedy, Coniniissioners of the Court. 

Squire Boone, deponent, respecting the claim of the heirs of 
Andrew Hannah for 1,0()U acres of land — the meeting place was 
Boone's Mill seat. He describes Gerusha"s Grove, where Squire 
Boone built a cabin and besan to work at a mill, bu fotind it not 
convenient to go on with it, and went into the settl-. ment to move 
his family out. This was in 1775. He gave George Smith Gerusha's 
Grove on Silver Creek. Boone made it his camping place with many 
others from Boonesborough to St. Asaph's Spring. St. Asai)h's Ford 
is here at the upper end of a little island, at the place known as 
Boone's Mill Seat. The cabin is on the hill side close l^elow the 
ford on the west side of the creek. He sold the cabin to .Iosei)h 
Benny. Squire Boone, Col. Calloway, Maj. Hoy and others came to 
the place some time in August, 1775. He moved his family out in 
1775. He made Gerusha's Grove in .July. 1775. Within the dis- 
tance of a mile about northeast course a black oak tree marked 
"S. & B." In answer to a question he said, "Before any person gave 
me any information I asked if it was not that course and distance, 
and they told me nearly. I believe it was .James Harris on the 
road between Silver Creek and David Gasses."

There were people came out and built cabins three-fourths or 
one-half of a mile above here called Banta. 1 was there when the 
cabins v.-ere building 16 or 18 years ago. Always heard the branch 
called Bone's Run. Banta's cabins stand on this side of .Muddy 
Creek, towards Boonesborough on the lower side, and the same side 
this branch runs in Muddy Creek.

(D, page 692) Frederick Referdam, age 50 years, same date, 
^ame case and same commissioners. 

I was passing frequently ttirough tlie woods in 17 81. I saw a 
tree marked with the first letters of Joseph Deban's name standing 
about a mile up the branch from the mouth, on the north side. In 
the year 1779 he heard of the tree marked near 800 miles from this 
place on Muddy Creek waters. Since he came to Kentucky he al- 
ways heard the branch called Deban's Run. 

(D, page 694) Peter Hackett, same date, same case, same place 
and same Commissioners. 

(D, page 69 4) Thomas Warren, same, about 55 years old. 

About 18 or 19 years ago the Dutch Company came up, called 
Banta's Company, to build cabins above here, about one-half mile. 
Some years after he heard this branch called Deban's Run, which 
he expected took its name from some of that company. It was a 
general thing at Estill's Station to call the Bald Hills about here 
the Bald Hills, but some called them Bald Knobs. On the east side 
of the creek they begin about one-half mile from here and run very 
thick on the east side about 4 or 5 miles, and on the west side they 
begin about 4 or 5 miles from here, and that it is 4 or 5 miles to 
the Knobs as called at Estill's Station, but might decently be called 
mountains. Knew nothing of Banta's beginning. 

(D, page 69 5) David Lynch, 3 8 years old, same date, case, 
place and soforth. 

This branch is the only one he ever heard called Deban's Run. 
He has been in Kentucky as his home ever since 1777, on Christ- 
mas Eve, and from summer of 1780 until this time has been well 
acquainted with these woods as any place in the State; never heard 
it (the branch) called by any other name than Deban's Run. Saw 
a tree marked up the branch on the north side; he thinks a white 
oak. It is S or 10 miles to the Knobs, a south course. The Bald 
Hills near here some call Bald Hills, some Bald Knobs, begin on 
the east side of the creek within one-half mile of here or a mile, 
and extend up the east side 5, 6 or 7 miles with here and there a 
skirt of woods; between them and the nearest part of the mountains 
is 6 or 7 miles off from this place. 

(Commissioner Daniel Miller's home was near this place, and 
near the mouth of a branch of what is called Hickory Lick, and 
near here in about 17 82, as related by Ambrose Coffee, in his depo- 
sition below copied, Peter Duree, John Bullock and John Bullock's 
wife, who was a daughter of old man Duree, were killed by Indians. 
He didn't remember when old Mr. Duree died, but Henry Duree and 
Daniel Duree were killed at the White Ooak spring on an early date, 
and Copart was killed at Boonesborough on an early date.)

the Locust Bent and the Elk Garden. Been here many a time since. 
I showed it to Bazil Maxwell. 

Witnesses to their signatures: Dudley Faris, Samuel Wallace.

Daniel Miller and Thomas Gollins, Gommissioners of the Gourt. 

In the fall of 17 80 deponent and Higgason Grubbs came from the 
station where James Hendricks lives a buffalo htinting, and fell in 
upon Drowning Greek, killed a buffalo, then turned off the creek. 
Game up a clift nearly where Rich. Estill now lives, through the 
woods and camped at a beech tree, he believes to be the beech tree 
we are now at, and then tells why he believes it. 

(E, page 230) Higgason Grubbs, same case. In 17 80 he and 
Jesse Goffee camped at the root of the beech tree where we are now 
tonight, when they went out buffalo hunting, and made the letters 
H. G. I. G. and the figures 178 at that time, also Oc for October, 
on this beech tree. After the location was made for William Shel- 
ton that he came to hunt for this tree, and Thomas Shelton and 
Peter Woods came with me, and found this tree very readily. 

The witnesses were questioned by Archibald Woods.

Gooper, Braxton Gooper, Sharswell Gooper, Patrick Woods, Charles 
Shurley, Higgason Harris, Daniel Hancock, Jesse Noland and others 
were going to Station Gamp, and as we came along Samuel Estill 
showed us an oak tree and spoke to Ben Estill and told him to 
take notice in case he should die that that tree was the beginning 
of James Estill's 1,000 acre entry, etc. On this trip was some dis- 
tance up the creek of Station Camp. Alexander Reid killed a deer 
some distance before we crossed Station Gamp Greek.

The Old Trace from Estill's Station to Miller's Bottom went by 
the Mulberry Lick, Hoy's Lick, on a branch of Station Camp Creek, 
just below Harris Massie's crossing, main Station Gamp, about a 
mile from the mouth. I know of six Licks on Station Cam]i or the 
main South Fork thereof. One about 1 ^4 miles below near Hen- 
ton's, the second at this place, the third at the Long Ford on ilie

North Fork of Station Camp, the fourth the old lick on the east 
side of Station Camp, the fifth and sixth on the west side 
of the main South Fork of Station Camp, the uppermost one not 
more than four miles from this place.

Deponent Martin. Locating Licks. One about 1 % miles below 
here on the east side of Station Camp on the side a noil, the sec- 
ond at Hinton's about the same distance on the west side of the 
creek, the third this place, the fourth about a quarter west of this 
on a branch, the fifth on the bank of the creek about 1,4 mile above 
here on the west side, the sixth about 1 V^ miles from here on the 
bank of the creek on the east, the seventh on the bank of the creek 
on the west side about 2 1^^ miles, the eighth on the bank of the 
creek on the east about 4 i/^ miles from this place, also the ninth on 
the War Fork, called the Salt Lick, besides a number of smaller 
deer licks too tedious for me to recollect and point out at present. 
In April, 1784, I came from Estill's Station in company with 
2 Samuel Estill, 3 Harris Massie, 4 John Woods, 5 William Kava- 
naugh, 6 Nicholas Proctor, 7 John Mitchell, 8 William McCrary, and 
several others (the others were probably those named in Humphrey 
Baker's deposition, towit: 9 Humphrey Baker, 10 Cal. Estili, 
11 Alex. Reid, 12 Benjamin Estill, 13 Benjamin Cooper, 14 Braxton 
Cooper, 15 Sharswell Cooper, 16 Patrick Woods, 17 Charles Shurley, 
18 Higgason Harris, 19 Daniel Hancock, 20 Jesse Noland, which 
composes a company of twenty men) in pursuit of a * * Indian 
camp near the mouth of Station Camp Creek, and I was showed by 
some of the company at or near the Blue Banks, about two miles 
from this place, there was the War Road to our right hand. And 
some short time after I came the same way with William Cradle- 
bough and passed by this lick along this trace, and he, also, in- 
formed me this was the War Path, and he showed me pictures 
made with both red paint and black, that he said was done by the 
Indians, and in particular showed me marks and pictures at this 
place, which are now some to be seen, and other trees that had 
them on it were cut down by my family. 

The beginning tree, two or three feet from the ground, is about 
fourteen feet around. In my answer to Estill I knew nothing but 
by information. Now I say the same. 

We on that scout did not follow this trace any, but on my trav- 
eling here the second time I traveled it perhaps between three and 
five miles up there, and up the West Fork to the Red Lick, thence 
to Estill's Station. But as to the size of the War Road, I can only 
answer it was a small path, and from where it came I know not. 

Do you know that this lick is on the War Road? 

I know this lick is on the same trace that was showed to me for 
the War Road. 

William Cradlebough was alive, for all I know or ever heard, 
and was living on the head waters of Otter Creek two months ago 
in Madison County.

6, 1801, at the house of Joseph Wells, on Station Creek, before 
Stephen Trigg and Joseph Boggs, Commissioners of the Court. 

In the fall of 17 8 was the first of my being acquainted with 
Station Camp Creek. The fall after James Estill was killed I was 
over on the east side of the creek passing to Miller's Bottom. We 
saw sign, thought to be Indian sign, on the east side of the creek, 
going down towards the Kentucky River, along a small path. Since 



Ilishiill mill (Icilfillnil'u'S 29 

that 1 was going up the river witli Slielby on a campaign after 
Indians on the east side of Station Camp, nearly opjiosite the lower 
crossing on Station Camp, when I saw at a lick at a small distance, 
pcrliaps not more than V4,' mile from said crossing, a number of 
Indian pictures, which were generally marked with black. I thought 
that the War Path went up on the east side of said creek, from 
said Indian Picture Lick, along up the Fork which is now called 
the South Fork, but which is called the Main Station Camp Creek, 
and there was a path cross the North Fork, at an old lick above 
the forks of Station Camp, which I thought was the same path called 
the War Path, which path I think crossed the creek twice. 

The Trace from Estill's Station to Miller's Bottom came out by 
the Mulberry Lick, from there to Hoy's Lick on the waters of Sta- 
tion Camp, about ^2 mile below, where Harris Massie now lives, 
thence down Hoy's Lick Branch a small distance, thence leaving 
Hoy's Lick Branch on the right hand, and what is now called 
Crooked Creek on the right hand, thence down into Station Camp 
Bottom, thence the bottom to a ford, opposite to the Picture Lick, 
thence up the Kentucky River to Miller's Bottom. I was passing 
by from one lick to another about sixteen or eighteen years ago, 
and Samuel Estill showed me an old lick on the bank of a small 
branch, where Azariah Martin now lives, running into Station Camp 
on the west side, where Samuel Estill told me James Estill and him- 
self had an entry of land of 1,U0 acres beginning on a large oak 
standing on the bank of the lick, from this lick at which the tree 
stands that was the beginning to the crossing at wiiat I thought was 
the War Road above the forks of Station Camp Creek. At the time 
I went on this campaign with Shelby I saw the pictures and they 
appeared to be fresh done. I did not examine whether they all were 
newly done, but my idea is now that the blazes on which the marks 
were had not been done a great while. But powder marks may 
appear to be newly done when they have been done a great while. 

There was a trace that came down from Hoy's Lick to what is 
called Hinton's Lick on the waters of Station Camp, thence across 
some small ridges bearing up Station Camp by where Joseph Wells 
now lives, thence across Station Camp nearly opposite to where 
Joseph Wells now lives, thence to Miller's Bottom. It is about lYz 
miles between the two crossings of Station Camp from Hoy's Lick 
to Miller's Bottom. There was a trace led past both the beginning 
lick showed me and the lick where Hinton lives. It was a com- 
mon thing from my early settling in this country, and from my 
general knowledge of the woods, for buffalo traces to lead from 
one lick to another, and from licks much frequented by game for 
traces to lead from them, even several miles out into the range. 
I think in the fall of 1780 I was first acquainted with the lower 
trace across Station Samp to Miller's Bottom. 

(E, page 242) Rev. Joseph Proctor, at the same i)lace, Feb. 
6, 1801, before the same Commissioners. 

I have been in Kentucky ever since the big battle at Boones- 
borough, and obtained a pre-emption of 400 acres from the Com- 
missioners. 

The Indians that traveled the South Fork of Station Camp gen- 
erally crossed the river above the mouth of Station Camp and came 
through the small Picture Lick, and so up the creek, passing op- 
posite to where Azariah Martin now lives on the east side of the 
creek, through a large cany bottom to the South Fork of said creek, 
and I think the trace crossed about 1 % or 2 miles above the mouth 
of the Red Lick Fork, at a small lick where there was a white oak

stood on the east side of the creek painted with red paint; the trace 
then turned up on the west side of the creek, it then ran up the 
creek and crossed it several times to a ford now called the War 
Fork, and nearly out at the head of that fork. It was generally 
the opinion of the people in the country that that was the War 
Road, and this deponent's opinion for thinking it was the War 
Road was the frequency of their traveling of it and the camps along 
the road which he has seen. One in particular, a Bark Camp, which 
he thinks was nearly thirty yards long. He believes the trace was 
the most traveled in the years 1780 and 17 81, from Estill's Station 
to Miller's Bottom, came out by the Mulberry Lick to Hoy's Lick, 
and he believes the one most frequently traveled from Hoy's Lick 
on the waters of Station Camp was from Hoy's Lick down Crooked 
Creek bottoms to the bottoms on Station Camp, leaving Crooked 
Creek on the right hand, thence down Station Camp Creek opposite 
to the Little Picture Lick, thence to Miller's Bottom. There was 
another trace we used to travel some times from Hoy's Lick on to 
Clear Creek and down Clear Creek to the crossing some distance 
above the mouth, thence cross the point of the ridge onto Station 
Camp Bottom, up the bottom to the above mentioned ford on the 
first trace. There was another trace that led from Hoy's Lick down 
Hoy's Lick for about a mile, thence cross Hoy's Lick Fork to 
Crooked Creek, thence through a large level white oak flat to a 
lick, thence to the top of a high ridge, the banks of the south side 
of the ridge was naked to the blue where the buffalos use to wallow, 
thence to a small creek to a lick on the bank of the creek on the 
south side, thence to a lick where Hinton now lives, thence it turned 
up on the ridge crossing several small ridges, along by where Joseph 
Wells now lives, thence to the lick where Azariah Martin now lives, 
thence cross Station Camp, thence over the mountains, through the 
woods to Miller's Bottom, or to the river, there being no trace from 
the crossing of Station Camp to the river. 

Question by Samuel Estill: Do you recollect in the years 1780 
and 1781, when George Adams came to range from Estill's Sta- 
tion with a company of men, that the said Adams applied to James 
Estill for a couple of pilots to show him all the suspected crossing 
places by the Indians, that James Estill ordered you and myself to 
pilot said Adams to Hinds Lick, as he thought it the most certain 
place for the Indians passing, and did not James Estill order us to 
pilot him over the river to the Picture Lick, and he refused to go, 
it being out of the county? 

Ans. I remember of being out with Major Adams on the scout, 
and I think, as well as I remember, we came out to Hinds Lick 
and went down to the river, or nearly there. Major Adams would 
go no further; then we turned and came back till we struck the 
trace again, and some where about where Hinton now lives we
