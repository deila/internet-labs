INTRODUCTION. 



The International Code of Signals consists of twenty-six flags — one for each letter 
of the alphabet — and a Code Pennant. 

Urgent and important signals are two-flag signals. 

General signals are three-flag signals. 

Geographical, Alphabetical Spelling Tables, and Vessels' Numbers are four-flag 
signals. 

The book is divided into three parts. The first part contains urgent and important 
signals and all the tables of money, weights, barometric heights, etc., together with a 
geographical list and a table of phrases formed with the auxiliary verbs. 

The second part is an index. It consists of a general vocabulary and a geographical 
index. It is arranged alphabetically. 

The third part gives lists of the United States storm-warning, life-saving, time- 
signal, and wireless telegraph stations, and of Lloyd's signal stations of the world. It 
also contains semaphore and distant signal codes and the United States Army and Navy 
and Morse Wigwag Codes.

INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO SIGNAL. . 



In the following instructions the ship making the signal is called A; the ship signaled to is called B. 

HOW TO MAKE A SIGNAL. 

1. Ship A, -wishing to make a signal, hoists her Ensign with the Code Flag under it. 

2. If more than one vessel or signal station is in sight, and the signal is intended 
for a particular vessel or signal station, ship A should indicate which vessel or signal 
station she is addressing by making the distinguishing signal (i. e., the signal letters) 
of the vessel or station with which she desires to communicate. 

3. If the distinguishing signal is not known, ship A should make use of one of the 
signals DI to DQ (page 37). ^ 

4. When ship A has been answered by the vessel she is addressing (see paragraph 9), 
she proceeds with the signal which she desires to make, first hauling down her Code 
Flag if it is required for making the signal. 

5. Signals should always be hoisted where they can best be seen, and not necessarily 
at the masthead. 

6. Each hoist' should be kept flying until ship B hoists her Answering Pennant 
"close up" (see paragraph 10). 

7. When ship A has finished signaling she hauls down her Ensign, and her Code 
Flag, if the latter has not already been hauled down (see paragraph 4). 

8. When it is desired to make a signal it should be looked out in the General 
Vocabulary (pages 143-451), which is the index to the Signal Book. 

HOW TO ANSWER A SIGNAL. 

9. Ship B (the ship signaled to), on seeing the signal made by ship A, hoists her 
Answering Pennant at the "dip." 

(A flag is at the "dip" when it is hoisted about two-thirds of the way up, that is, 
some little distance below where it would be when hoisted "close up.") 

The Answering Pennant should always be hoisted where it can best be seen. 

10. When A's hoist has been taken in, looked out in the Signal Book, and is under- 
stood, B hoists her Answering Pennant "close up" and keeps it there until A hauls 
her hoist down. 

11. B then lowers her Answering Pennant to the ' ' dip, " and waits for the next hoist. 

12. If the flags in A's hoist can not be made out, or if, when the flags are made out, 
the purport of the signal is not understood, B keeps her Answering Pennant at the 
"dip" and hoists the signal OWL or WCX, or such other signal as may meet the case; 
and when A has repeated or rectified her signal, and B thoroughly understands it, B 
hoists her Answering Pennant "close up." 

(11) 



12 INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO SIGNAL. PART I. 

NOTES ON SIGNALING. 

1. Plurals.— To facilitate the translation of the Code into foreign languages, the 
plura'ls of words given in the Signal Book have been omitted. The words should be 
regarded as being used in the singular, unless the contrary is indicated by the context. 

2. When making Signals for comparing Chronometers (page 58) or show- 
ing the Mean Time vessel A is to hoist the signal denoting the hour (seepage 58), 
and shortly after the signal has been answered by B dip it sharply to denote the precise 
instant used for comparison. The signals denoting the minutes and seconds shoivn by 
the chronometer at the instant of dipping are then to be hoisted. To insure accuracy, 

a second comparison should be made. 

« 

3. In signaling Longitude or Time vessels should always reckon from the 
meridian of Greenwich, except French and Spanish vessels, which will use the meridian 
of Paris or Cadiz, respectively. If any doubt is entertained, the vessel to which the 
signal is made should hoist NBL = What is your first meridian ? 

4. Meridians.— The British Meridian is that of Greenwich. The Meridian of Paris 
(Observatory) is 2° 20' 15" east of Greenwich, or h. 9 m. 21 sees. The Meridian of 
Cadiz (San Fernando Observatory) is 6° 12' 24" west of Greenwich, or h. 24 m. 
49.6 sees. 

5. Passing Vessels. — Ships passing one another or Signal Stations will do well to 
hoist the following signals in the order shown : 

(1) National Colors with the Code Signal under them. {The Ensign should 

be kept flying until all communication is ended; the Code Flag may be 
hauled down if it is required for making a signal.) 

(2) Ship's name (signal letters). 

(3) Where from. 

(4) Where bound. 

(5) Number of days out. 

(6) My longitude by chronometer is — . 

The ensign should be dipped and rehoisted as a farewell. 

When vessels are passing each other quickly, time will be saved if, instead of hoist- 
ing the Answering Pennant, they exchange signals in the following manner : 

On reading A's name (that is, distinguishing signal), B should hoist hers. 
A should not haul down until she understands B's hoist, when both ships 
should haul down together and proceed in the order suggested above. 

6. Procedure -when signaling Names and Addresses. — The following course 
is to be followed when making a signal which contains the ship's name and the owner's 
name and address : 

Ship A, wishing to obtain orders from her owner, will make — 

(1) Her distinguishing signal (signal letters). 

(2) The signal SW = I wish to obtain orders from my owner, Mr. — , at — . 

(3) The owner's name, by spelling it letter by letter (see page 13) or by using 

the Alphabetical Spelling Table (pages 14-15). 

(4) The owner's address, by spelling it letter by letter (see page 13) or by using 

the Alphabetical Spelling Table (pages 14-15). Signals from the Geo- 
graphical Table (page 89) can also be used in some cases. Figures 
can be made by the Numeral Signals on page 32 or by the Numeral 
Table on page 33. 



Part I. 



INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO SIGNAL. 
EXAMPLE. 



13 



Ship A wishes to get orders from her owner (say), Mr. C. Thomson, at 25 Broad 
street, Few York. 

Having hoisted her national colors with the Code Signal under them, she makes 
the following signals : 



1st hoist, 

2d hoist, 

3d hoist, 

4th hoist, 

5th hoist, 

6th hoist, 

7th hoist, 

8th hoist, 

9th hoist, 

10th hoist, 

11th hoist, 

12th hoist, 

13th hoist, 

14th hoist, 

15th hoist,

BRO) 



AD 



=Broad. 



Code Flag over Gt=The Alphabetical Signals are ended, 

WZN=Si7-eef. 

AZOT =New York. 



ALPHABETICAL (SPELLING) SIGNALS. 

Under the arrangement explained below, every flag hoisted after Alphabetical 
Signal No. 1 has been made, and until Alphabetical Signal No. 3, or Numeral Signal 
No. 1 (see page 32) is made, represents the letter of the alphabet which has been allotted 
to it in the Code. As each of the 26 letters of the alphabet is now represented by a flag, 
any word can be spelled by this system. 

If the word to be spelled consists of more than four letters, two or more hoists must 
be used, as no hoist is to contain more than four flags, and, if any letter occurs more 
than once in the word, this letter must on its second occurrence begin or be in a second, 
hoist, and on its third occurrence must begin or be in a third hoist. 

The following are the signals to be used :

Code Flag over Flag & — 



Alphabetical Signal No. 1, indicating that the flags hoisted after it 
until Alphabetical Signal No. 3 or Numeral Signal No. 1 is made do 
not, represent the signals in the Code, but are to be understood as 
having their alphabetical meanings and express individual letters of 
the alphabet which are to form words. 

Alphabetical Signal No. 2, indicating the end of a word made by- 
Alphabetical Signals, or dot between initials. 

Alphabetical Signal No. 3, indicating that the Alphabetical Signals 
are ended ; the signals which follow are to be looked out in the Code 
in the usual manner.

NUMEKAL SIGNALS. 



Under the arrangement shown below, every flag hoisted after Numeral Signal No. 1 
has been made, and until Numeral Signal No. 3 or Alphabetical Signal No. 1 (see page 13) 
has been made, represents one or more figures as indicated in the Numeral Table below. 

If the number to be signalled consists of more than four figures, two or more hoists 

must be used, as no hoist is to contain more than four flags; and if any' figure occurs 

more than once in the same number, the figure must on its second occurrence begin or 

be in a second hoist, and on its third occurrence it must begin or be in a third hoist, 

•unless use can be made of the signals K to Z in the Numeral Table below. 

* The following are the signals to be used :

Numeral Signal No. 1, indicating that the flags hoisted after it, until 
Numeral Signal No. 3 or Alphabetical. Signal No. 1 is made, do not 
represent the signals in the Code, but "express figures, as indicated in 
the Numeral Table below, and have the special numerical values there 
given to them. 

Ncmeral Signal No. 3, indicating the Decimal Point. 

Numeral Signal No. 3, indicating that the Numeral Signals are ended ;

sels, which will use the meridian of 
Paris, and Spanish vessels, which will 
use the meridian of Cadiz. If any 
doubt is entertained, the vessel to 
which the signal is made should hoist 
NBL (What is your first meridian?) 
Note. — The vessel showing the mean 
time will hoist the signal denoting the 
hour (see page 58) and dip it sharply 
shortly after it has been answered; 
the minutes and seconds at the instant 
of dipping will immediately follow. 
To assure accuracy, a second compari- 
son should be made.

DECREES OF LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE. 



Vessels other than those of Spain or France use the meridian of Greenwich. 
Spanish and French vessels use the meridians of Cadiz and Paris, respectively. In case 
of doubt, the vessel to which the signal is made should hoist the signal NBL = What 
is your First Meridian ? Which can be answered by one of the following : 

TBL = My first meridian is Paris, east of Greenwich. 2* 20' 15" = h. 9 m. 21 sees. 

HSI = My first meridian is Cadiz, west of Greenwich 6° 12' 24" = h. 24 m. 49 sees.

508 STORM-WARNING DISPLAY STATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. PART III. 



EXPLANATION OF STORM WARNINGS. 

Warnings of the approach of windstorms will be published by the display of flags 
by day and lanterns by night, in connection with the bulletins posted and the reports 
furnished to newspapers, mariners, and others interested. 

The warnings adopted by the United States Weather Bureau for announcing the 
approach of windstorms are as follows : 

The Storm Warning (a red flag, eight feet square, with black center, three feet 
square) indicates that a storm of marked violence is expected. 

The Red Pennant (eight feet hoist and fifteen feet fly) displayed with the flags, 
indicates easterly winds — that is, from the northeast to south, inclusive — and that the 
storm center is approaching. * 

The White Pennant (eight feet hoist and fifteen feet fly) displayed with the flags, 
indicates westerly winds — that is, from north to southwest, inclusive — and that the storm 
center has passed. ) 

When the Red Pennant is hoisted above the Storm Warning, winds are expected 
from the northeast quadrant; when below, from the southeast quadrant. 

When the White Pennant is hoisted above the Storm Warning, winds are expected 
from. the northwest quadrant; when below, from the southwest quadrant. 

Night Storm Warnings. — By night a red light will indicate easterly winds; a white 
above a red light will indicate westerly winds. 

The Information Warnings have been discontinued at all storm-warning display 
stations, and such advices as were previously given in information orders will be furnished 
hereafter in advisory messages. 

The Hurricane Warning (two storm-warning flags, red with black centers, dis- 
played one above the other) indicates the expected approach of a tropical hurricane or 
of an extremely severe and dangerous storm. 

No night Hurricane Warnings are displayed.

Noon-time signals are sent to every office of the Western Union Telegraph Company 
in the United States, and by going to any one of them corrections for chronometers 
may be obtained (75th meridian time). 

The signals sent out by the Observatory are wholly automatic, and consist of a 
series of short makes, produced in an open telegraph circuit by the beats of a mean- 
time clock, the pendulum closing the circuit at each beat. 

The signals begin at 11Tb. 55m. 00s. and cease at 12h. 00m. 00s., 75th meridian, 
mean time. 

During that interval there is a make at the beginning of every second, except that 
in each minute the makes corresponding to the 29th second and to the 55th, 56th, 57th, 
58th, and 59th seconds are omitted. 

Thus, the first make after the pause of five seconds always marks the beginning of 
a minute, and the first make after the pause of one second marks 30 seconds. In order 
to distinguish the last minute and give time to manipulate switches to time balls, 
control clocks, etc., the makes cease after llTi. 59m. 50s. and until 12A. 00m. 00s., when 
there is a single make and the signals cease. 

When these signals are received at points where the time of the 90th meridian is 
used they will give the time from 10k. 55m. 00s. to Uh. 00m. 00s., or just one hour earlier 
than when representing 75th meridian time; otherwise the signals will be read in the 
manner above described.

The following regulations governing the use of the U. S. Naval Coastwise Wireless 
Telegraph stations are hereby established: 

1. The facilities of the naval coastwise wireless telegraph stations (including the one 
on the Nantucket Shoal lightship), for communicating with ships at sea, where not in 
competition with private wireless telegraph stations, are placed at the service of the pub- 
he generally and of maritime interests in particular, under the rules established herein, 
which are subject to modification from time to time, for the purpose of — 

(a) Reporting vessels and intelligence received by wireless telegraphy with regard to 
maritime casualties, derelicts at sea, and overdue vessels. 

(6) Receiving wireless telegrams of a private or commercial nature from ships at sea, 
for further transmission by telegraph or telephone lines. 

(c) Transmitting wireless telegrams to ships at sea. 

2. For the present this service will be rendered free. All messages will, however, be 
subject to the tariffs of the ship stations and land lines. Arrangements have been made 
with both the Western Union and Postal Telegraph companies for forwarding messages 
received from ships at sea. When a message is not prepaid the company delivering it 
will collect the charges. Shipowners should arrange with companies operating the land 
lines as to tariffs and the settlement therefor. Messages will not be accepted for trans- 
mission to ships whose owners have not agreed to accept unpaid messages, unless a suffi- 
cient sum is deposited to cover all charges. 

3. The Nantucket Shoal Lightship station will report vessels and transmit messages 
from them, if the signals are made by the International Code or any other known to the 
operators on the lightship. 

4. When notified by the Weather Bureau of the Department of Agriculture, naval 
wireless telegraph stations will give storm warnings to vessels communicating with them 
by wireless telegraphy. Storm warnings will soon be sent to the Nantucket Shoal light- 
ship by wireless telegraphy, and storm signals furnished by the.Weather Bureau will be 
displayed therefrom to warn passing vessels. 

5. All vessels having the use of the naval wireless telegraph service are requested to 
take daily meteorological observations of the weather when within communicating range, 
and to transmit such observations to the Weather Bureau by wireless telegraphy at least 
once daily, and transmit observations oftener when there is a marked change in the 
barometer. 

6. Arrangements for a time signal service by wireless telegraphy are now being made. 



Part III. united states naval wireless telegraph stations. 513 

7. All shipowners desiring to use any special code of signals for communicating with 
the Nantucket Shoal Light-ship station or any of the shore stations, or make any other 
special arrangements, are requested to communicate with the Bureau of Equipment, Navy 
Department, Washington, D. C. 

8. All chambers of commerce, maritime exchanges, newspapers, news agencies, and 
others desiring to have vessel reports and general marine news forwarded to them regu- 
larly are requested to communicate with the Bureau of Equipment in order that necessary 
arrangements for the service may be made. In no case will an operator attached to a 
station be allowed to act as an agent for any individual or corporation, but all vessel 
reports and marine news not of a private nature will be supplied to all applicants so long 
as this service does not too greatly tax the personnel of the stations, when it will be neces- 
sary for those desiring information involving much time for its distribution to appoint 
agents who will be allowed access to the station bulletins. 

9. Naval wireless telegraph stations are equipped with apparatus of several systems, 
and can communicate with all the principal wireless telegraph systems now in use if tuned 
to the same wave length. The Department is desirous of cooperating with all shipowners 
wishing to avail themselves of its wireless telegraph service, and, judging from its experi- 
ence with numerous systems, it is believed that there will be little or no difficulty in 
arranging for communication between its stations and ships equipped with apparatus of 
other systems if the owners of the apparatus as well 'as the owners of the ships are desirous 
of establishing such communication. 

10. Vessels desiring to make use of this service regularly must agree to transmit and 
receive all Government messages free. 

The Bureau of Equipment expects to erect wireless telegraph stations at the principal 
points along the coast of the United States and at points in its insular possessions. As 
fast as they are completed they will be open for public use under the regulations established 
herein. , 

Notice will be given in the " Notices to Mariners" when stations are put in operation 
or withdrawn from the service for any reason. 

The Nantucket Shoal light-ship will transmit its messages to the Torpedo Station, 
Newport, R. I. All messages intended to be. sent via this light-ship to ships at sea should 
be sent to the Torpedo Station. 

Arrangements have been made with the Weather Bureau for the transmission of mes- 
sages between Cape Henry wireless telegraph station and Norfolk. All messages intended 
for the Cape Henry station should be sent via the Weather Bureau, Norfolk, Va. 

All messages intended for Dry Tortugas should be sent via the Naval Station, Key 
West,.Fla. 

The station at Goat Island, Cal., can be reached by either the Postal Telegraph or 
the Western Union system, and the one at Mare Island by the Western Union. 

The Farallon station will communicate with Goat Island, Cal. 

instructions to govern communication by wireless telegraphy between 
wireless telegraph stations and ships. 

I. A vessel wishing to communicate with a station, and having ascertained by " listen- 
ing in" that she is not interfering with messages being exchanged within her range, should 
make the call letter of the station at a distance not greater than 75 miles from it. 

11. The call should not be continuous, but should be at intervals of about three min- 
utes, in order to give the station a chance to answer. 

III. After the station answers, the vessel should send her name, distance from station, 
weather, and number of words she wishes to send ; then stop until the station makes O.K., 
signals the number of words she wishes to send to vessel, and signals to go ahead. 

IV. Then the vessel begins to send her messages, stopping at the end of each 50 words 
and waiting until the station signals O. K. and go ahead; when all messages have been

sent she will so indicate. If the sender desires to designate the Western Union or Postal 
Telegraph system for further transmission of his message, he should do so immediately 
after the address; as, for example, "A. B. C, Washington, D. C, via W. U. (or P. T.)." 

V. When a vessel has indicated that she has finished, the station will send to the ves- 
sel such messages as she may have for her, in the following order. 

(a) Government business, viz, telegrams from any Government Departments to their 
agents on board. 

(6) Business concerning the vessel with which communication has been established, 
viz, telegrams from owner to master. 

(c) Urgent private dispatches, limited. 

(d) Press dispatches. 

(e) Other dispatches. 

VI. In the case of the Nantucket Shoal light-ship, it will, immediately on receiving 
the vessel's call, acknowledge, and (after receiving vessel's name, distance, weather report, 
and number of words she wishes to send) transmit the first three to Newport, and then tell 
the vessel to go ahead with her messages. 

VII. After receiving these and sending the vessel any message on file for her, the 
light-ship will transmit to Newport messages received from the communicating vessel in 
the following order: 

(a) Government business. 

(6) Urgent private dispatches, limited. 

(c) Press dispatches. 

(d) Other dispatches 

VIII. A naval wireless telegraph station has the right to break in on any message 
being sent by a vessel at any time, and the right of way may be given at any time to a 
Government vessel or one in distress. 

IX. When two or more vessels desire to communicate with a naval wireless telegraph 
station at the same time, the one whose call is first received will have the right of way, and 
the others will be told to wait and will be taken up in turn. Vessels having been told to 
wait must cease calling. 

X. In case communication is not established with any ship for which messages are on 
file, the naval wireless telegraph station will notify the telegraph company from which the 
messages were received, giving sufficient information for them to identify the telegrams 
and notify the sender. 

XI. In order to obtain the best results, both sending and receiving apparatus should 
be tuned to wave length of 320 meters. 

XII. Until further notice the speed of sending should not exceed 12 words per 
minute. 

XIII. In order that all messages received at naval wireless telegraph stations maybe 
forwarded to ships for which they are intended, and in order that all ships equipped with 
wireless telegraph apparatus may receive storm warnings, they should always report when 
in signaling distance of a naval wireless telegraph station. 

XIV. The service being without charge at present,the Government accepts no respon- 
sibility for the reception or transmission of messages from or for passing vessels. Every 
effort will be made to transmit all messages without error and as expeditiously as possible. 
It must be remembered that errors are not uncommon in ordinary telegraph and cable 
messages, so that due allowance should be made. 

XV. In order that the service may be made as good and as useful as possible, it is 
requested that complaints should be promptly reported to the Bureau of Equipment as 
soon as possible after the cause therefor, giving date, hour, and other details, to enable 
the Bureau to investigate the case. 

XVI. Information regarding the naval wireless telegraph service will be published in 
"Notices to Mariners."

LIFE-SAVING DISTRICTS AND STATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. 



All manned Life-Saving Stations of the United States are equipped with Inter- 
national Code flags, and are prepared to send or receive signals in that code or by means 
of the United States Army and Navy Wigwag Code. They are in many cases, however, 
unprovided with means of telegraphic communication. 



LIFE-SAVING SIGNALS. " 

The following signals, recommended by the International Marine Conference for 
adoption by all institutions for saving life from wrecked vessels, have been adopted by 
the Life-Saving Service of the United States: 

1. Upon the discovery of a wreck by night, the life-saving force will burn a red 
pyrotechnic light or a red rocket to signify, "You are seen; assistance will be given as 
soon as possible." 

2. A red flag waved on shore by day, or a red light, red rocket, or red roman candle 
displayed by night, will signify, "Haul away." 

3. A white flag waved on shore by day, or a white light swung slowly back and 
forth, or a white rocket or white roman candle fired by night, will signify, "Slack away." 

4. Two flags, a white and a red, waved at the same time on shore by day, or two lights, 
a white and a red, slowly swung at the same time, or a blue pyrotechnic light burned 
by night, will signify, "Do not attempt to land in your own boats; it is impossible." 

5. A man onshore beckoning by day, or two torches burning near together by night, 
will signify, "This is the best place to land."

LLOYD'S SIGNAL STATIONS. 
SIGNALS USED AT LLOYD'S SIGNAL STATIONS. 



Part III. 




This signal indicates that the station at which it is hoisted is tem- 
porarily closed, and that no communication can be held.* 




This signal indicates that telegraphic communication is interrupted, 
and that messages can not be forwarded by telegraph, but will be 
forwarded by other means as soon as possible.* 



• These signals will be kept up until tbe signal station is again occupied, or until telegraphic communication is again possible. 

These stations are available to shipowners for reporting the passing of their vessels. 

At these signal stations the International Code is the only code recognized, and 
vessels of any nation may make their names known by means of this code, and thus 
secure the immediate publication of the announcement in the "Shipping Gazette and 
Lloyd's List" and "Lloyd's "Weekly Shipping Index." Cases of wreck or other acci- 
dents at sea should always be made known by shipmasters to the signal stations with 
which they communicate. 

Night signals at special stations. — The apparatus used for the signals will be a 
flashing lamp. 

A series of continuous short flashes is to call the attention of a passing vessel. 

A series of long-short flashes, repeated as often as may be necessary, indicates that 
a vessel's signals have been seen and recognized. 

If a signal shown by a vessel has not been understood the lamp will be kept dark 
until the vessel repeats the signal. 

Special night signals at certain stations. — Also, to denote telegraphic interruption 
during the night, the signal stations at the Old Head of Kinsale and Brow Head will 
show S green lights, arranged in the shape of a triangle, apex upward; and to call 
attention to this signal a Roman candle will be burnt if the vessel can be recognized.

If no cones are available, a square flag may be substituted for the cone point upward, a pennant for the cone point downward, and 

a wheft for the drum. (See page 629.) 



Part III. 



DISTANT SIGNALS. 



1. Distant Signals are required when, in consequence of distance or the state of 
the atmosphere, it is impossible to distinguish the colors of the flags of the Inter- 
national Code, and, therefore, to read a signal made by those flags ; they also provide 
an alternative system of making the signals in the Code, which can be adopted when 
the system of flags can not be employed. 

2. Three. different methods of making Distant Signals are explained below: 

(a) By Cones, Balls, and Drums. 

(6) By Balls, Square Flags, Pennants, and Whefts. 

(c) By the Fixed Coast Semaphore. 
The last method (Fixed Coast Semaphore) is not necessarily a method of making 
Distant Signals, as it can be, and is, used at close quarters and under conditions when 
flags could equally be employed, but it has been placed here under the heading of 
Distant Signals for ease of explanation. 

3. The Characteristic of Distant Signals is the Ball; one ball at least appearing 
in each hoist of the Distant Code. In the case of the Semaphore the ball is replaced 
by a Dish. 

4. Hitherto only three Symbols have been required for Distant Signaling, but 
the increase made in the number of flags of the International Code renders four Sym- 
bols necessary, in order that it may be possible to provide a distinct hoist to represent 
each of the flags of the Code (*. e., letters of the alphabet). 

5. Distant Signals are made 

From a ship — by hoisting shapes. 

From the shore— by hoisting shapes, or by the position of the arms of a 
Semaphore. 

6. The Shapes used as Symbols are : 

(a) A Cone point upward, 

A Ball, 

A Cone point downward, and 

A Drum. {The Drum should fee at least one-third greater in height^ 
than the Ball. ) 
(6). A square Flag may be substituted for the cone point upward. 

A Ball, 

A Pennant may be substituted for the cone point downward, and 
A Pennant with the fly tied to the halyards, or a Wheft for the drum. 
(A wheft is any flag tied in the center.) 
As in calms or when the wind is blowing toward or from the observer, it is impossible 
to distinguish with certainty between a square flag, pennant, and wheft, and as flags 
when hanging up and down may hide one of the balls and so prevent the signal being 
understood, the system of cones and drums is preferable to that of flags, pennants, 

and whefts. . 

(c) In signaling by the Semaphore, the positions of the arms represent 

the shapes.

DISTANT SIGNALS. 



Part III. 



7. To simplify the "Taking in," "Reporting," and "Reading off" of the Distant 
Signals, the four positions of the Semaphore Arms, and the four Symbols have been 
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. 

1 representing the Semaphore Arm pointing upward, on 

the opposite side to the indicator, a Cone with the or 

point upward, or a square Flag. 

Indicator i 



2 representing the Semaphore Arm pointing horizontally, 

on the opposite side to the indicator, or a Ball.

3 representing the Semaphore Arm pointing downward, 

on the opposite side to the indicator, a Cone with 

the point downward, or a Pennant.

4 representing the Semaphore Arm pointing horizontally, 4 mm 
' on the same side as the indicator, a Drum, or a Pen- or 

nant with the fly tied to the halyards, or a Whef t. 

Indicator 

8. To facilitate signaling by Semaphore or Shapes, the signals representing the 
tetters of the alphabet have been arranged in numerical order, the figures represent- 
ing the signal for the letter A being the first in numerical sequence. 

Thus A is represented by 1 1 2. 
Thus B is represented by 1 2 1. 
Thus C is represented by 1 2 2, 
etc., etc. 
The signals representing the letters from A to G begin with 1, 
Those from H to U begin with 2, 
Those from V to Z begin with 3, 

And the Special Signs (i. e., Code Flag, Alphabetical, Numeral, and Finish- 
ing Signs) begin with 4. 

(See plates V and VI.) 

9. The Code Flag Sign 4 2 1 {see plates V and VI) is always to be shown before 
signals taken from the General Vocabulary of the International Code are commenced. 

10. When -signals are made by the Semaphore the disk is always to be kept up 
until the signal is completed, and the hoist is to be read from the top arm downward. 



11. The Stop Signal 



or 



is to be made at the end of each complete signal. 



Part III. 



DISTANT SIGNALS.

12. With, two Balls, two Cones, and one Drum, every signal in the International 
Code can be made, each hoist representing one letter of the two, three, or four letters 
forming the signal.

ALPHABETICAL DISTANT SIGNALS. 

13. When it is desired to spell a word by Distant Signals, the Alphabetical Sign 
4 2 2 (see Plates V and VI) is to be shown first. All the hoists which follow until 
the Finishing Sign 4 3 2 (see Plates V and VI) is shown are to be understood as rep- 
resenting the particular letters of the alphabet allotted to them in Plates V and VI, 
which, when combined, spell the word which it is desired to signal. 

NUMERAL DISTANT SIGNALS. 

14. When it is desired to signal numbers by Distant Signals, the Numeral Sign 
4 2 3 (see Plates V and VI) is to be shown first. After that sign has been shown, and 
until the Finishing Sign 4 3 2 (see Plates V and VI) is shown, the hoists representing 
the various letters of the alphabet (see Plates V and VI) are to be understood as hav- 
ing the numerical values which are allotted to the particular letters under the system 
of making Numeral Signals by flags, which is explained on page 32. 

Thus, after the Numeral Sign 4 2 3 has been shown, the Distant Signal hoist rep- 
resenting the letter A will mean the number 1, that representing B will mean 2, that 
representing K will mean 11, and so on as in the Numeral Table on page 32. 

SPECIAL DISTANT SIGNALS. 

15. As shown in the Example to Paragraph 12, above, signals from the General 
Vocabulary of the International Code require to be made by more than one hoist, which 
involves loss of time. Arrangements have, however, been adopted by which thirty- 
seven important signals (see pages 527-531) can be made by one hoist only. These 
thirty-seven signals are called "Special Distant Signals," and are represented by the 
numbers explained in Paragraph 7, page 524, and not by letters. 

16. The Special Distant Signals are distinguished from Distant Signals taken from 
the General Vocabulary of the International Code by the fact (1) that they are not 
preceded by the Code Flag Sign (see paragraph 9), and (2) that the Stop Signal imme- 
diately follows the single hoist representing the particular "Special Distant Signal" 
which is being made.

SEMAPHORE SIGNALS. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE BRITISH MOVABLE SEMAPHORE. 



THE INDICATOR. 

The Indicator denotes from which, side the signs are to be read, but when first 
shown it is to call attention, and may be considered the preparative signal. When 
closed it denotes the finish of the communication. 

HOW TO SEMAPHORE. 

The person intending to Semaphore will make the International Code Signal VOX 
(I am going to Semaphore to you), and set his Semaphore at the alphabetical sign (see 
Plate VII) with the Indicator out, and wait until the person to whom the Semaphore 
signal is to be made hoists his answering pennant close up. Then he will proceed 
with the communication by spelling, making a momentary pause between each sign or 
letter ; the arms are to be dropped between each word or group* the Indicator alone 
remaining out. 

Should the answering pennant be dipped by the person taking in the signal, the 
last two words are to be repeated until the answering pennant is again hoisted close up. 

When in the middle of a spelling signal numerals have to be made, the Semaphore 
is to be put at the numeral sign (see Plate VII), and the number then made. When 
the numeral signal is finished the alphabetical sign is to be made and the communi- 
cation by spelling proceeded with. 

HOW TO ANSWER AND TAKE IN SEMAPHORE SIGNALS. 

The answering pennant is to be hoisted close up by the person taking in the 
Semaphore signal, thus denoting he is ready to read and write down the signal. 

It is to be "dipped" when a word is lost, and the person making the signal is then 
to repeat the two last words until the answering pennant is hoisted again close up. 



In answering by the Semaphore the And in position (3) the <\ 

r\ answering pennant close ^Os

arm in position ( I ) represents the an- 



answering pennant close

SEMAPHORING BY HAND FLAGS. 

(1) British Method. 

The British method of Semaphoring by flags held in the hand which is shown in 
plate VIII is exactly the same as the British Movable Semaphore system, which has just 
been explained, the positions of the apparatus which denote the letters, numbers, and 
special signs being, it will be seen, identical in each case, and the only difference being 
in the apparatus employed. 

(2) French Method. 

The French method of Semaphoring by flags held in the hand (see 'plate IX) is 
based on the same principle as the British method, but the positions in which the flags 
are held to denote the letters, etc., are different.

or 



Semaphore stations and vessels at sea may exchange either "semaphore telegrams" 
'messages." 

/. Semaphore Telegrams. 

Definition.— The semaphore telegrams are those which are sent partly over the tele- 
graph 'wires. Semaphore telegrams sent from vessels at sea are accepted for all countries 
which have signified their adherence to the Telegraphic Convention of St. Petersburg and 
which are named in the following list : 



Argentine Republic. 


Germany. 


Persia. 


Australia. 


Great Britain. 


Portugal.

Semaphore telegrams intended for ships at sea are accepted for all the French sema- 
phore stations marked with an "a" in the Geographical List, Part I, of the International 
Code. 

Wording and transmission. — Messages may be worded either in the language of the 
country for which they are intended or in the signals of the International Code. These 
signals are represented in writing by means of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet. 
The number of letters in each group should not exceed four. 

The groups of letters signaled from a vessel sending a semaphore telegram are trans- 
lated by the signal officer into the language of the country in which the semaphore station 
is situated, and it is this translation which is transmitted to the addressee. 

Upon a request from the vessel, however, made by the signal XB or WZ (see ' 'Urgent 
and Important Signals," Part I), the groups of letters themselves will be transmitted with- 
out translation. 

The address and, if necessary, the signatures to telegrams from ships at sea are 
always transmitted in ordinary language by electric telegraph. The address of telegrams 
intended for ships at sea should specify the name or official number of the vessel and her 
nationality. 

Charges. — (1) The usual telegraphic charge and any accessory charges which the 
circumstances may render necessary. 

(2) A maritime charge which has been fixed at five centimes per word with a mini- 
mum charge of fifty centimes per telegram for transmission in France. For international

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE SYSTEM. 



The whole number opposite each letter or numeral stands for that letter or numeral. 



TO SIGNAL WITH FLAG, TORCH, HAND LANTERN, OR BEAM OF SEARCH LIGHT. 

There are but one position and three motions. 

The first position is with the flag or other appliance held vertically, the signalman 
facing squarely towards the station with which it is desired to communicate. 

The first motion, or "one" or " 1," the signal is waved to the right of the sender 
and will embrace an arc of 90°, starting with the vertical and returning to it, and will 
be made in a plane exactly at right angles to the line connecting the two stations. 

The second motion, or "two " or " 2," is a similar motion to the left of the sender. 

To make the third motion, "front" or "three" or "3," the signal is waved to the 
ground directly in front of the sender, and instantly returned to the first position. 

Numbers which occur in the body of the message must be spelled out in full. 

To use the torch or hand lantern, a footlight must be used as a point of reference 
to the motion. The lantern is more conveniently swung out upwards, by hand, from 
the footlight for "1" and "2" and raised vertically for "3." 

(545) 



546 UNITED STATES ARMY AND NAVY SIGNAL CODE. PAET III. 

TO SEND A MESSAGE. 

"To call" a station, signal its initial or call letter' nntil acknowledged. To 
acknowledge a call or receipt of a message, signal " I understand." 

Make a slight panse after each letter and also after "front." If the sender 
discovers that he has made an error, he should make the "front" and "12.12.3," after 
which he proceeds with the message, beginning with the word in which the error 
occurred. 

PLASH SIGNALS WITH LANTERN, HELIOGRAPH, OR SEARCH LIGHT. 

Use short flash for "1," two short flashes in quick succession for "2," and a long 
steady flash for "3." The elements of a letter should he slightly longer than in sound 
signals. 

To call a station, make the initial or call letter until acknowledged. Then turn 
on a steady flash until answered by a steady flash. The calling station will then 
proceed with the message. 

All other conventional signals are the same as for the flag. 

SOUND SIGNALS WITH POG WHISTLE, POG HORN, OR BUGLE. 

Use one toot (about half second) for "1," two toots (in quick succession) for "2," 
and a blast (about two seconds' long) for "3." The ear and not the watch is to be 
relied upon for the intervals. 

The signal of execution for all tactical or drill signals will be one long blast 
followed by two toots in quick succession. 

In the use of any other appliance, such as a bell, by which a blast can not be given, 
three strokes in quick succession will be given in the place of the blast to indicate "3." 

When more than two vessels are in company, each vessel, after making "I 
understand," should make her call letter that it may be certain which vessel has . 
acknowledged.

(a) LIGHT AND SOUND SIGNALS, ACCORDING TO COLOMB'S FLASHING 

SIGNALS SYSTEM. 



The following urgent and important signals may be made at night or in thick 
weather, either by long and short flashes of light or by long and short sounds on a 
steam whistle, siren, fog horn, etc. : 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF FLASHING OR SOUND SIGNALS. 

With flashing signals the lamp must always be turned toward the person addressed. 

To attract attention, a series of rapid short flashes or sounds should be made and 
continued until the person addressed gives the sign of attention by doing the same. 

If, however, it is supposed that the person addressed can not reply, the signal may 
be made after a moderate pause, or, under certain circumstances, the communication 
may be made without preparatory signs. 

(547) 



548 MORSE SIGNAL CODE. PART III. 

After making a few rapid short flashes or sounds as an acknowledgment, the 
receiver must watch or listen attentively until the communication is completed, when 
he must make the sign indicated below, showing that the message is understood. 

If the receiver does not understand the message, he must wait until the signal is 
repeated. 

Duration of short flashes or sounds — 1 second. 

Duration of long flashes or sounds — - - 3 seconds. 

Interval between each flash or sound 1 second.

(6) FLAG WAVING. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMUNICATING BY FLASHING SIGNALS WITH A 
FLAG (GENERALLY TERMED FLAG "WAVING). 

The system used is the Morse Alphabet, the letters being made by groups of long 
and short flashes caused by moving a flag through a long or short arc, as described 
below. 

The signalman may work from left to right, or from right to left, as shown in fig- 
ures 1 and 2, according to convenience and direction of the wind. 






f \ 








^ 



Figure 1. Figure 2, 



In the normal position (a) in the above figures, the flag should make an angle of 
25° with a vertical line through the center of the body. 

The pole should be kept high enough to permit seeing underneath the flag while 
in motion. 



Part III. morse signal code. 549 



TO MAKE A SHORT FLASH OR DOT. 



The flag is waved from a to b, and -without any pause back again to the normal 
position. i ' ' 



TO MAKE A LONG FLASH OR DASH. 

The flag is waved from a to c, and after a short but distinct patise at c brought 
back to the normal position. 

WHEN SIGNALING A LETTER. 

When signaling a letter the flashes representing it should be made in one con- 
tinuous wave of the flag, taking particular care that no pause is made when at the 
normal position. 

Example. — To make B, wave the flag from a to b back to a and with 

out a pause down to c, making there a short but distinct, pause (vide instructions for 
long flash) back to a, then withdut a pause to b and back to the normal position a. 

HOW TO SIGNAL. 

A pause equal to the length of a long flash should be made at the normal position 
a between each letter of a word, or letter of a group of letters. 

When the word or group of letters is completed, the butt of the staff is to be 
brought to the ground, and the flag at the same moment gathered in. 

A slight pause should be made at the normal position before commencing a word 
or group of letters. 

In receiving a message the flag should be lowered and gathered in until required 
for answering. 

POSITION OF THE SIGNALMAN. . 

The signalman should stand square to the station to which he is signaling, and 
the pole should be kept as upright as possible while, in motion, the point never being 
allowed to droop to the front. 

In order to keep the flag always exposed while moving it across the body to form 
the flashes, the point of the staff should be made to describe an elongated figure of 8 
in the air.

THE USE OF THE SPECIAL SIGNS. 



THE PREPARATIVE. 

Is used to call attention, and is answered by the General Answer 

THE GENERAL ANSWER. 

Is made by a long flash , or letter T. 

THE BREAK SIGN. 

Is to be used between the address of the receiver and the text of the message, and, 
after the text, if the name of the sender is signaled. 

THE STOP. 

Is made by three separate letter I's. 

THE FINISH. 

Is to be made by V E in one group at the completion of a message, and is to 
be answered, if the message is understood, by R D in separate letters. N. B. — R D 
means Read. 

THE ERASE. 

Is made by a series of E's as separate letters, and is used to erase a word or group 
that has been wrongly sent, and is to be answered by the Erase. 

THE ANNUL. 

Is made by W W in one group, and is used to negative all the message that has 
gone before, and is to be answered by the Annul. 

METHOD OF ANSWERING. 

Each word when understood is to be answered by one long flash (T). 

If a word is not answered, the sender is to repeat it until answered by a long flash. 

At the end of the message, if understood, receiver will make 

(or R D), meaning Read. 

The Erase and Annul signs are to be answered by their own signs. 

METHOD OF SIGNALING NUMBERS. 

All numerals, whether representing time, distance, numbers, etc., are to be spelled 
in full. 



552 MORSE SIGNAL CODE. PART III 

METHOD OF ASKING FOR REPETITION. 

If the receiver requires any word to be repeated, lie makes 

Repeat. W A 

(or, repeat word after) the word — (or, if necessary, words) preceding the doubtful word. 
Note. — When W A is only sent, the Repeat sign is implied. 
If the receiver requires the remainder of the message, he makes 

Repeat. A A 

(or, repeat all after) the word — preceding the doubtful ones. 
If the receiver wants all the message repeated, he makes 

Repeat. A L L 

When he requires no more repetition, he makes — — - — ^— — — (or, R D), 
which means the signal is read. 

IF A MISTAKE IS MADE IN A WORD. 

The sender makes the Erase sign etc^, E's as separate letters, which 

is to be answered by the Erase sign. 

N. B. — This only applies to the last word made. 

IF A WHOLE MESSAGE REQUIRES TO BE NEGATIVED. 

The sender makes the Annul ■ — — (or, W W as one group), 

which is to be answered by the Annul.
