we loved it."

we thought, even if it 
wasn't complimentary." 




BETTE ANNE 
"We had to say if 
things were easy or 
hard and did they taste 
good."

things mean, like baste 
and fold and sift." 




CHRIS 
"If we didn't like it, 
Betty Crocker didn't 
put it in this book." 




LUCY

ure exactly. When we 
didn't we had trouble."

were tested we had a 
wonderful party."

what we made excel- 
lent, good, fair, or

liked things enough to 
make them again."

It's really easy to cook, 
if you do what it says 
in the recipe."

Good things to make for parties— for holidays— for your friends 
—and just for fun. 

Of all the extra-specials, cakes are tops. And how proud 
you'll be when you make a birthday cake for Dad, a Heart Cake 
for Mother on Mother's Day, an Igloo Cake for your little 
sister, or any cake on these pages. 

There are lots of other fun things you can make like fancy 
drinks and Black Cat Cookies and Eggs in a Frame for a camp- 
fire lunch. 



You'll want to try them all before you are through and a good 
place to start is with a special cake. You can make any of these 
cakes easily if you follow directions carefully and take to heart 
all the cakemaking tips over there on the next page.

Cakemaking Tips 




Liquids and eggs should be about room 
temperature. 

Use a wooden spoon for stirring. 



Always prepare cake pans by greasing thoroughly and dusting 
with flour. 

Use a rubber scraper to keep spoon and bowl clean so batter will 
mix well. 

Get the last of the batter out of the bowl with the rubber scraper. 

Cake is done when a toothpick stuck into center comes out clean. 

When two times are given in the recipe (as 20 to 25 minutes) 
set timer for first and see if cake is done. Give extra time if 
needed. 

Set pans on cooling racks when they 
come from the oven. 



After 10 minutes turn cake from pans to 
finish cooling on racks. 

Cakes are ready to ice when cool.

Icing Makes the Cake 

Icing is best when it is as soft as possible, but it must hold its 
shape without running off the cake. 

Spread a little along the inside of the mixing bowl with the 
back of your mixing spoon and see whether or not it is ready 
to use or needs more confectioners' sugar or liquid added.

Party Ideas 




Paper bag masks are easy to make. Paint on any face you want 
and cut out holes for the eyes and mouth. You can cut out flaps 
on the sides for ears. 

Make a lantern by cutting slits across a piece of paper, but do 
not cut all the way to the edges. Then roll your paper in the 
direction of the slits. Unroll it and roll it in the opposite direc- 
tion and paste the ends together. Paste on a strip of paper for 
the handle. 

You can decorate your cups, too. When you cut out the figures, 
fold your paper in half so that both sides will be the same. 
Paint on any face you want.

For Unusual Shapes 

If you have cooky cutters that 
you like, you'll use them of 
course. Always dip them in 
flour so they won't stick to the 
dough. 

Or make your own patterns- 
Draw or copy the pattern on 
heavy cardboard. Cut out 
each one and grease it. Lay 
pattern greased side down on 
dough and cut around it with 
a sharp knife. Lift onto bak- 
ing sheet with wide spatula. 




Attractive Designs Make 
the Prettiest Cookies 

After you've decided on the a 
shapes, making the design is 
fun. Try some of these first. a 

Then let yourself go, use your 
imagination, and see what ex- 
citing designs you can create.

64 CAMPFIRE COOKING 



Cxuirumre, (Joolcing 

When you cook outdoors it's a good idea to appoint one of the 
group Chief. The Chief can then give everyone a job to do. 

Travel Light. Don't take more equipment than you need. Extra 
things to carry are just a burden. A frying pan, pancake turner, 
empty coffee can, stirring spoon, small pail for water, a sharp 
knife, and a fork for everyone will be enough for any of the 
recipes given to you here. 




Building the Fire. The Hunter's Fire is easy and gives a steady 
heat. To build it, lay 2 green logs in a V-shape, about 7 inches 
apart at one end and 4 inches apart at the other. The wider open- 
ing should face the wind. 

Build a foundation fire between the logs and then add fuel as 
you need it. For the best results, you should let the fire burn 
down to coals before you start to cook. 

When you are ready to cook, set the frying pan near the nar- 
row end. 

Don't Play With Fire. Small fires are the best. They're the easi- 
est to work with and they don't get away from you. 

Keep a pail of water handy for putting out the fire. If you 
don't have water, sand will do the trick. 

Before you leave the camp site, be sure your fire is out and 
the ground completely cold.

BREAKFAST 81 




You can be a big help. In one family we know, everyone takes a 
turn helping to get breakfast. And what rivalry ! 

The littlest one pours out the cereal, puts the silver around, 
or rings the breakfast bell. 

Older children choose their jobs— fixing the fruit, adding 
fancy touches to the cereal, frying the eggs, stirring up an easy 
coffee cake, making cocoa.

give your mother a holiday and prepare breakfast all yourself.

Soft-Cooked Eggs ^ 

Never boil eggs. Always cook them slowly and gently. 




Cover eggs in saucepan with 
cold water. Heat until water 
boils. 

Take from heat. Cover pan. 
Stand off heat 2 to 4 minutes. 

Take from hot water. Hold 
the egg with a paper napkin 
and break shell by cracking 
sharply with a knife. Scoop 
egg from shell with a tea- 
spoon. 

Season with salt and butter. 




Break soft-cooked eggs by 
cracking sharply with a knife. 



Fried Eggs 



Heat a thin layer of butter 
or bacon fat in heavy frying 
pan until moderately hot. 

Break eggs, one at a time, 
into saucer. Slip into frying 
pan. 

Reduce heat to cook slowly. 
Cover and cook until whites 
are set ( 3 or 4 minutes ) . 

You can turn the eggs if you 
like them that way. Then 
cook until yolks are as you 
want them. 




It's easier to keep the yolks 
whole if you slip the eggs one 
at a time from a saucer into the 
frying pan.

Salad Tips 



When you make a salad always use cold ingredients and then 
chill the finished salad before you serve it. Lettuce makes a 
pretty garnish that's good to eat and everyone will want to eat 
it if it's fresh and crisp. 




1. To prepare lettuce for a 
salad, cut out the core with 
a sharp-pointed knife. 





2. To loosen the leaves, hold 
lettuce, with cut side up, 
under running water. 




3. Peel off as many leaves 
as you need and wash them 
thoroughly. 




4. Gently pat dry between 
paper towels or in a towel. 



5. Wrap leaves loosely in a 
fresh towel or put them in a 
plastic bag. 




6. Chill the leaves well in 
the refrigerator.

DINNER 141 



iMaer 



Dinner is the sociable meal of the day when all the family sit 
down together and tell what's happened at school, at work, and 
at play. 

You can help make dinner more than just another meal if you 
learn and practice the arts of the dinner table. 

Take Pride in the Table. For happy family meals set the table 
just as carefully and attractively as you would for company. 
Always use a pretty centerpiece even if only a little pot of ivy 
from the window sill or a figurine off the cupboard shelf. 




Care About Etiquette and Good Manners. When you have good 
manners people like you better and enjoy having you around. 
There is a reason for all the rules— to show consideration and 
thoughtfulness for others and make mealtimes a pleasure. 

Good manners are not something to put on for company, but 
should be a part of us. They are like walking and talking and all 
other skills. Once we learn them, they just come naturally. 

Make Dinner a Fun Time. Start a game of Table Topics. Each 
member of the family has a turn choosing the topic and all tell 
everything they know about it. Anyone may be challenged, so 
you'll want to keep the dictionary or encyclopedia handy.

sure to wash your hands. 

Read your recipe and all directions very carefully. Look at 
the pictures. They tell you how to do each step. 

Put all your ingredients on a tray. Then set each one off as 
you use it.

COOKBOOK FOR BOYS AND GIRLS 

This is a brand new kind of cook book planned by boys and girls for 
boys and girls. A panel of 12 Junior Testers picked out the 245 
recipes and ideas, and tested every one. 

Delightfully illustrated, this book is full of party surprises, des- 
sert ideas, camping-out specials, and plenty of easy-to-make good 
things to eat. There are many "how to" step pictures, and special 
pages on kitchen safety rules, utensils, and measuring instructions. 

Using this book, boys and girls can prepare any number of treats 
for their friends or for the whole family.
