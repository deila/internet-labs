VOLUME XXIX 

PREFACE 

IT may, perhaps, appear at first sight that an encyclopaedia arranged in alphabetical order should 
need no Index volume, more especially a work like the Eleventh Edition of the Encycloptedia 
Britannica, which has replaced the comprehensive general, or " omnibus," articles, so char- 
acteristic of the earlier editions, by a number of shorter articles easily consulted by the student. 
But it still remains true that to make the fullest and best use of the book an index of some kind is 
imperatively needed. Since any encyclopaedia worthy of the name must take all knowledge for its 
province, it is obvious that the world itself would scarcely contain the volumes which /v/ tor an 
would have to be written, were every person, place or thing treated in a separate index. 
article. Moreover, the distribution of information over a number of short articles involves the 
necessity of collecting it together again in a form convenient for reference. To meet this need, as 
well as to point the reader to information on other subjects, not themselves included among the 
40,000 article headings of the. Eleventh Edition, an Index has been compiled, which, though 
containing considerably more than 500,000 headings, even so only aims at presenting a selection, 
not a miscellany, of information. If every name mentioned, however casually, in the Encycloptedia 
Britannica and every scrap of information had been indexed, the references would have filled a 
library. Indeed the Encyclopedia Britannica itself would have been rewritten, and not bettered 
in the process. 

The editors of this Index believe that in the case of such a work as the Encyclopedia 
Britannica the value of the Index depends less upon exhaustiveness than upon intelligent selection 
and arrangement. There is no more potent cause of mental indigestion than a mass Principle of 
of unsifted and often irrelevant detail. If economy of space is required in a reference tae la ^*- 
book, there is a still more urgent demand on the part of the inquirer for economy of effort. In the 
case of any one of the great figures of history, or the leading scientific theories, a reader does not 
want to be referred to every passing allusion to Julius Caesar, or Napoleon, or Bismarck. The 
article on Augustus says that he was born in the year of Cicero's consulship, but to record that fact 
in the Index under the heading "Cicero" would be neither intelligent nor useful. Nor would the 
reader who wishes to get a clear idea of die 1 )ar\vinian theories be grateful to an index which 
referred him to every passage containing the word "evolution." 

In short, the Concordance-index has been studiously avoided. The ideal has rather been to 
render easily accessible all information of real importance in the book, and rigorously to exclude 
passing allusions to subjects which are more fully treated elsewhere. To help the reader to find 

199 



vi PREFACE 

what he wants in the quickest and easiest way has been the guiding principle throughout. It 
is, for instance, scarcely necessary to enunterate the different holders of a title such as the 
Concordance earldom of Derby, when the majority of them are dealt with only in the article 
ideal avoided. " Derby, Earls of." In all such cases the one general reference to the article has 
been allowed to cover all the particular references to individual earls; but if important references 
to these individuals occur in other articles, such as the article " English History," they will be found 
in the Index under the name of the earl in question. 

No index can divine every difficulty in advance or forestall every objection. There are many 
words, more or less synonymous, which might equally well be chosen as index headings. Is 
Selection of " Arboriculture " or " Forestry " to be taken as the heading under which to group 
headings. foresters' lore ? Is theology and legend about the prince of darkness to be indicated 

under the heading "Satan" or "Devil"? Here the work of the compilers of the Index has 
been to a great extent simplified by the necessity of following the article headings, which 
all appear in the Index, standing out boldly in capital letters. There are articles on both 
"Arboriculture" and "Forests and Forestry." The Index gives one reference to the first, adding 
a cross-reference "see also Forests and Forestry," and under this heading groups all further 
information on the subject. Similarly under "Satan" we find "see Devil," and the first reference 
under " Devil " is to the article so entitled. 

The aim of the Index is, in fact, twofold. In the first place it seeks to distribute under a still 
larger number of headings the information which the editor has distributed over 40,000 headings in 

the book. The measure of success attained may be estimated by the fact that these 
Twofold aim. 

headings total over 500,000, every one of which is, as it were, the skeleton of an 

encyclopaedic article. Even a single textual reference and a map-reference to a town not important 
enough to call for a separate article enable the reader to find its geographical position, its accessi- 
bility by rail, sea, river or canal, its distance from other towns, and its commercial, historical or 
other principal interest. In the second place the Index seeks to group round each of the 
40,000 article headings all other important references to the same subject found in other parts of 
the book. It is important, however, to notice that in all such cases the first reference given is the 
reference to the article itself, and that references to the same subject from other articles will be 
naturally fewer in proportion to the amount of detail contained in that article. Hence the absence 
of any specific reference in the Index to any special event in a man's life, or to one particular aspect 
of a well-known theory, does not imply that the information is not in the book, but merely that it 
is so fully dealt with in the article itself that other references would add no substantial information. 

On the other hand, in the case of very large articles such as those on Egypt, England or the 
United States, the Index will be found to contain further references to special sections of the article 
Arrangement itself. This is especially noticeable when it has been necessary to collect together 
of references. information germane to such sections from other articles. The best example of this 
principle is to be found in the history sections of the Index under the names of all the larger 
countries. The Index has throughout steadfastly avoided the common fault of supplying merely 
a long list of entries without specific description. Such entries technically called "blind" have 
been limited to four at the outside. Those which will be found standing at the head of a group of 
specified entries are to passages giving general infoimat'on. Thus, if a commander has an article 
heading, the first entry directs the inquirer to that article ; the second perhaps to a passage 
describing his importance in the history of the country to which he belonged ; the third to an article 
on the military aspects of the war in which he fought. Specified entries thereafter will refer to 
particular battles described in and by themselves from the tactical standpoint. All such entries, 



PR I- 1 \CE vii 




. arc admitted only if il.ry lead i<> maicri.il information not in the arli< IP on the 
commander himsell. 

This has Ix-cii tin: hr-.t \y. The second has been effected by the shortness of the form 

ol reference adopted. It is i in > t point how far an index should itself convey information. Is 
every individual to have a d;*te an 1 .1 description attached to his name? If he has, he will occupy 
two lines, where one will do ; if IK has not, he may get confused with a place or a thing, or with 
another person of the same| name To obviate this catastrophe Christian names Form of 
or initials are given wherever possible, and in their absence a short description, eg. reference*. 
"author." "general," " vizier, " " I rsian governor." Geographical references can be recognized 

ich by the fact that every town name is followed by an abbreviation indicating the country 
in which it is situated, whilst ph\sical features such as Like, river, mountain are so described. Now 
and again, no doubt, confusion is possible; every index has its humours, and at first sight the 
rryplic form " Folk, ( ). 20-~<"' ( ' I 14)" may not suggest a town in Ohio. But the initiated, who have 
consulted the list of abbreviations on p. i, will know that on p. 26 in vol. 20 they will find that place 
in the map square (H-I4). In l;he case of references which are neither to persons nor to places, a 
description is seldom given, th assumption being that the man who consults an. index knows what 
he is looking for and is capable of recognizing it when he sees it. But in the case of names very 
similar to each other, or of tertais used in more than one science, such distinguishing marks as 
"geol.", " bot." or "zool." are added in parentheses. In a word, the principle has been to avoid 
any possible confusion. 

The system of alphabetization adopted is that of the Encyclopedia itself, which takes every 



heading, whether consisting of "in- 
"Ant" comes before "Antae," bu 



eater." Some slight modifications

The system adopted for th'- geographical references has already been indicated. It will 
be found that the very numerou maps have been systematically indexed throughout, and that 
every place marked in them : : n the Index, these map references being Map refer- 

readily distinguishable by the ad' letter and number in brackets, indicating . 

map squares, e.g. 5-403 (A'2). The Index is, therefore, not only an index, but also a gazetteer. 

The numerous illustrations, whether 1'lates or Cuts in the text, received careful consideration. 
As economy of space was thre'ighout an urgent necessity, it was finally decided not to index the 
illustration as such where it in its natural context, or where there is a reference to 



Vlll 



PREFACE 



the description in the text. For instance, the article " Carp," about p column in length, contains 
an illustration. It did not appear necessary to duplicate the referenlce to "Carp" in the Index, 
so as to indicate this figure. But if the figure had appeared elsewhere (e.g. in 
the article "Ichthyology"), the Index would have acjlded to its references under 



Illustrations. 



" Carp " a reference to the volume and page where this figure occur 
after the reference. The reference is always specifically given, if

er that sculptor's name to the 
ences to the names of works 



known only to experts. On the other hand, pictures, statues or other objects of interest bearing 
well-known distinctive names are separately indexed with their Platrt references. 

One other class of references calls for special notice. It ha^ been the aim of the Eleventh 
Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica to assist readers in the interpretation of technical or unusual 
Dictionary terms. To this end the editor has included a nurjnber of dictionary headings, i.e. 
headings. short articles giving the derivation, meaning and vjarious uses of such terms. These 

article headings appear as a matter of course in the Index, but a much greater number of terms, 
English and foreign, defined in the course of the scientific, philosophical and other articles have 
also been indexed. To such references the word " diet." is adcaed by way of an indication that the 
information to be found will be of a dictionary rather than of an Encyclopaedic character. 

The value of any index depends to a large extent on the fulness of its cross-references. This 
Index has tried to supply a reasonable number of variants to j names which a reader may look for 
Cross- under more than one spelling. It has also indicated the relationship between family 

references. names and titles, by cross-referencing the first" to the second. Under such geo- 
graphical prefixes as "North," "South," "High," "Low," "Great," "Little," a general cross- 
reference indicates that such names are as a rule to be found reversed, e.g. " Wycombe, High," 
except in American place-names, and a few other special ca.ses. It should be observed that the 
simple cross-reference ("Julius Caesar: see Caesar") is us id only when the two sides of the 
reference are exactly equivalent. Other cross-references (e %. a single peer to the family title) 
are in the form "see also " or "see under" 

An entirely new feature has been added to the Index volu me of this edition for the use of those 
desiring to study subjects as a whole. At the conclusion of tli Index proper there will be found a 
Classified table classified table of contents, in which the article headings in the Encyclopaedia are 
of contents. grouped broadly according to their subjects, e.^. Geography, History, Religion, Art, 
and subdivided into their natural sections (e.g. Art into Pairjiting, Sculpture, Music, Architecture). 
In all cases the biographical articles will be found together with the appropriate subject headings. 
A fuller account of the system adopted is prefixed to the tablej itself.

RULES AND ABBREVIATIONS 



I. Typ. Headings printed in bold Clarendon type (e.g. 
ALEPPO) represent article headings in the Encyclopedia, and 
the first reference under every such heading is to the article in 
ion. 

All references show (i) the volume in bold Clarendon figures ; 
(2) the page in light face type; (3) the exact quarter of the 
page by means of the letters a, b, c, d, signifying respectively 
the upper and lower halves of the first and second columns, 
e.g. A (letter) 1-1 a. In geographical references these letters are 
replaced by an indication of the map square in the usual form, 



A rule or dash ( ) denotes the repetition of the preceding head- 
ing, or of its first separate word. Hyphened words are treated 
as single words. Headings in italic type denote books, news- 
papers, or periodicals. Quotation marks are used for pictures, 
ships, statues, race horses and separate poems or musical 
compositions. 

II. Alphabetization. All titles, whether consisting of a 
single word or of more than one, and if of more, whether 
hyphened or not, are treated for the purpose of alphabetization 
as single complete headings. In the majority of cases the same 
rule applies to inverted headings. Surnames followed by Chris- 
tian names and geographical headings like " Wycombe, High " are 
exceptions. An epithet or phrase in parentheses is not treated 



as part of the heading for alphabetical purposes except in a 
series of identical headings (see Preface, p. vii.). 

Where the same name denotes human beings, places and 
objects, the order is (i) persons, (2) places, (3) things. 

The prefixes " Me " and " M' " are alphabetized as " Mac " ; 
" St " is treated as " Saint," " S.S. " as " Saints." 

III. Geographical Headings. The names of towns and 
villages are followed by the abbreviation for the country to 
which they belong. For this purpose English counties and the 
states of the United States rank as countries. All other topo- 
graphical headings are described as "riv.," "mt.," &c. In 
cases like " Big Mountain," " Big River," denoting physical 
features the arrangement is 

Big, mt. 

,riv. 

Such a heading as " Big Mountain, Utah " would therefore 
denote a town, not a mountain. In the names of American 
counties, e.g. Madison Co., the word Co. is treated as part of 
the heading. 

IV. Abbreviations. The following list includes general 
contractions adopted for the purpose of this Index. The 
contractions usual in special branches of knowledge are in- 
cluded in the Index itself and in the article Abbreviation 
(vol. i. page 27).
