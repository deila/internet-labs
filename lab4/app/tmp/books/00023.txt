606 BREWSTER GENEALOGY 

Azubah (Gillet) HIGLEY of Becket, born there, November 6, 1787; 
died at Pittsfield, Mass., January 21, 1875. He died at Pittsfield, 
May 3, 1869. 

" Doctor John M. Brewster's early education was received at 
Lenox (Mass.) Academy. . . . He commenced the study of med- 
icine under his father's instruction; attended a course of lectures in 
New Haven, in 1810, and graduated at the Medical School in Bos- 
ton, in 1812; reached home the very day his father was brought 
home dead of apoplexy, and commenced immediately the practice 
of medicine at his native place, where he remained until 1821, when 
he removed to Lenox, and was a successful physician in that and 
neighboring towns for sixteen years. He was town clerk there for 
two years. In April, 1837, he removed to Pittsfield, and continued 
his profession with zeal, fidelity, and success for thirty years, making 
in all fifty-five years of continuous practice. His physical constitu- 
tion was of the most robust kind. Till after he was seventy years 
of age he would mount his horse with no other help than the stirrups 
and ride with grace and fieetness. 

" Dr. Brewster welcomed to his home Gerritt Smith, Elihu Bur- 
ritt, Henry Wilson, and many of the early anti-slavery advocates. 
The friendship that existed between himself and the honorable 
Charles Sumner (of glorious memory) was constant and unabated 
to the close of life. He was an anti-slavery man when it cost some- 
thing to be one — as far back as when James G. Birney was a candi- 
date for President. Studious of social propriety and civil obligations 
he firmly and conscientiously took his chances on the side of man- 
hood and right, and calmly and quietly awaited the result. 

" Need it be said that his grand conduct as husband, father, neigh- 
bor, citizen, and physician was the outcome of a character which was 
born of Jesus of Nazareth." 

Dr. BrcM'ster was twice a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of 
Massachusetts, but was not elected. 

The illustration opposite was the home of Dr. John M. Brewster 
at Pittsfield, bought by him of General Nathan Willis, in 1837, and 
it remained in that family until sold, in 1882. The next year the 
house was demolished. It was built previous to 1799, and had the 
credit of having been a station of the underground railroad for 
fugitives from the South on their way to Canada.

of Pittsfield, b. there, May 18, 1816. " His early education 
was received in Lenox, his collegiate in Williams College 
(grad. 1837), and his medical studies were under his 
father, and at Berkshire Medical College, where he gradu- 
ated in 1839, and commenced practice in Pittsfield. In 
1862 he was commissioned as surgeon of the 40th Mass. 
Eegiment. He was fearless, and in the Army he was 
neither afraid to utter his convictions, nor defend them. 
When at Morris Island, S. C, he was attacked with chronic 
diarrhea, and it necessitated his leaving the Army, Oct. 
3, 1863. As soon as he was able, he resumed his practice 
in Pittsfield. He was at the time of his death president 
of the Berkshire Medical College." Chn., h. at Pittsfield:

He died at Whitesboro, N. Y., February 7, 1895. 

Timothy Dwight Hunt was graudated from Yale College in 1840, 
and Auburn Theological Seminary in 1843, and December 4, of the 
same year, he and his wife sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where 
he became a missionary. Owing to heavy storms, they were 225 days on 
the voyage. He remained in Hawaii about a year, when he accepted a 
professorship in the national school at Lahainaluna. Two years later he 
was called to Honolulu, and was there three months, when gold was dis- 
covered in California. A most deplorable state of society and morals 
then existed in the latter place, and at the urgent request of many, Mr. 
Hunt went to San Francisco, where he was cordially received by the 
representative men, and at a public meeting was declared the chaplain 
of the town. Mr. Hunt was the first Protestant minister in Cali-

ter of Dean BUCK of Wethersfield, born there, in 1818; died at 
Clayton, Cal., July 10, 1894. He died at Clayton, September 29, 
1894. 

Chauncey E. Wetmore attended Middletown (Conn.) Academy, 
took a collegiate course and attended lectures in New York City. 
He then taught school in Herkimer County, N. Y., was principal 
of the public school at Middletown and at Wethersfield, Conn,, then 
spent six months in the Teachers' Academy at Andover, became a 
tutor in Mt. Hope College, Baltimore, Md., and later opened and 
conducted a private school in that city, but his health failing he 
sold the school and engaged in mercantile pursuits. 

On Dec. 22, 1847, Mr. Wetmore, his wife and brother Henry 
sailed for California, and after stopping at Valparaiso, Callao, and 
other points of South America, and at Honolulu, S. I., they arrived at 
San Francisco, Aug. 27, 1848. Here he was a merchant until April 
3, 1849, when he and his family settled at Benicia, Cal., where he 
formed a partnership with his brother-in-law, Samuel C. Gray, who 
had brought a large consignment of goods from Baltimore and New 
York, and Mr. Wetmore continued in Benicia until Nov. 22, 1853. 
During his residence there he was active in founding Benicia Female 
Seminary and building the first Presbyterian Church, and was a 
trustee and superintendent of public schools. From Nov., 1854, to 



708 BREWSTER GENEALOGY 

Aug., 1857, he was a merchant at Vallejo, Cal., and was active in the 
piiblic interests of that town. 

He was a delegate to the first Eepublican County Convention and 
to the first State Convention of that party in California, and made 
the only Eepublican speech at Vallejo during the campaign. His 
politics having caused him serious business losses he sold his inter- 
ests and removed to Diablo Valley, where he began farm life. In 
1858 he was elected justice of the peace and associate justice of the 
Court of Sessions; was a member of the Eepublican State Conven- 
tion of 1860, and Oct., 1862, was appointed assessor of internal 
revenue for Contra Costa County, holding the position for four 
years. 

On November 1, 1874, he sold his farm and removed with his 
family to Clayton, Cal., and in 1875 to Oakland, Cal., where he 
engaged in the real estate business. In 1882 Mr. Wetmore retired 
and returned to his farm near Clayton, where he spent his declining 
years. His most characteristic traits were his unswerving and un- 
compromising devotion to principle, his high ideals and public spirit.

married first, at Millbury, Mass., April 18, 1854, SUSAN" E., daugh- 
ter of John BATCHELLEE of Millbury, and widow of Horace 
HUTCHINSON". She was born at Sutton, Mass., February, 1824; 
died at Kewark, Ohio, August 30, 1860. Married second, at Eock- 
ford, 111., October 9, 1865, ELIZABETH, daughter of Professor 
Ealph EMEESON, D. D., of Andover (Mass..) Theological Seminary, 
and wife, Eliza (Eockwell), born at Andover, February 15, 1836. 
He died at Clifton Springs, N". Y., April 22, 1906. 

At the age of seventeen years Simon J. Humphrey went to Eoches- 
ter, N". Y., where he was employed in a wholesale grocery house four 
and a half years. Jle then decided to enter the ministry ; fitted at 
Oberlin (Ohio) College in 1842-43, and was graduated from Bow- 
doin College in 1848. Working his way, he taught school during 
the winters, and a year in Pinkerton Academy at Derry, N. H. ; was 
graduated from Andover Theological Seminary in 1852, and preached 
six months at Jamaica Plain, a suburb of Boston, during which time 
the Congregational Church there was organized. He was ordained

as district secretary for the Interior States of the American Board 
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and retired in 1893, after 
twenty-nine years of successful service with them. 

" Dr. Humphrey," says The Advance, " possesses rare literary 
taste and felicity of expression, and during all these years his pen 
has been a busy one. Thirty-three numbers of Missionary Papers, 
first issued as supplements to The Advance, were prepared by him 
and attained a circulation of nearly a million copies. Various leaf- 
lets, among them The Story of the Bees and For His Sal-e, have a 
circulation of about 200,000 copies. He has also published a delight- 
ful volume of missionary sketches, Eshcol, or Surprising Triumphs 
of Grace in Missionary Lands. Several series of articles have 
attracted attention, among them Facts and Fancies of Travel, 
published after his European tour, and the series entitled Jesus 
and the Sages, growing out of the Parliament of Eeligions at the 
Columbian Exposition, also The Pathology of Unbelief and the 
Way Out, and two years of weekly notes on the International 
Sabbath School Lessons." 

In addition to the literary work previously noted. Dr. Humphrey

labors of his pen of the last twelve years into a number of volumes. 
The titles of a few of his latest works are: The Testimony of the 
Editions, The More Abundant Life, The P^wer of Prayer in Com- 
mon Things, and Studies in the Life of Jesu^.

married at Johnstown, N. Y., May 11, 1840, ELIZABETH, daughter 
of Honorable Daniel and Margaret (Livingston) CADY of New 
York State, born November 12, 1815 ; died at New York City, Octo- 
ber 26, 1902. He died at New York City, Jan. 14, 1887. 

" A little red schoolhouse in Pachaug (Griswold) and a rickety 
academy in Jewett City, Conn., furnished Mr. Stanton his education 
before he entered public life. ... 

" Henry Brewster Stanton was one of the early anti-slavery agita- 
tors and won many honors in journalism. He became one of the 
most effective platform orators who defended human rights in the 
great controversy preceding the war, and in 1834, at the anniversary 
in this city [New York] of the American Anti-Slavery Society, of 
which he was secretary, he faced the first of the two hundred mobs 
he battled against in his devotion to the cause of freedom. As a 
public speaker he was ranked with "Wendell Phillips, but his taste 
for politics early drew him into the Liberty party. He took sides 
with the Democracy in New York local contests at this period, but 
was an ardent Republican when the issue of slavery and secession 
became paramount in National affairs. In the early anti-slavery 
contest Mr. Stanton spoke for the relief of the oppressed in the 
principal cities of England, Scotland, Ireland and France. He was 
a member of the Free Soil party and served in the Massachusetts 
Senate for two terms. He was also a member of the New York Senate 
in 1850. He helped to launch the Republican party in 1855, and 
took the stump for Governor Seward. In 1847 he made his home 
at Seneca Falls, N. Y., and being admitted to the bar there, soon

acquired a reputation as a successful lawyer in patent cases. He did 
a great deal of valuable work on newspapers. He wrote for the 
Tribune when Mr. Greeley was its editor, and subsequently for the 
Sun, with which he had a close connection up to the time of his 
death. He published a book called SJcetches of Reforms and Re- 
formers in Creat Britain and Ireland, after his trip to Europe in 
the forties. His autobiography was engaging his attention when his 
fatal illness began." — New Yorh Tribune. 

Mr. Stanton's wife, Elizabeth (Cady) Stanton, was the celebrated 
lecturer and president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. 
She was co-author with Susan B. Anthony of The History of 
Woman Suffrage, or History of the Progress of Women, and was 
the author of other publications. Her father was a distinguished 
lawyer, judge and congressman in New York State. 

" If the intellect of Elizabeth Cady Stanton had been possessed 
by a man he would have had a seat on the Supreme Bench or in 
the Senate of the United States. ... In intellectual power she 
was a peer among men and unequaled among women. ... In 
personal life Mrs. Stanton was the calmest, sunniest and most evenly 
poised of mortals, with an unfailing fund of humor that made her 
a most delightful companion. She possessed a fine philosophy, which 
enabled her to bear with fortitude the heaviest blows and keenest 
disappointments." — Ida Huster Harper. 

Mr. and Mrs. Stanton's last residence was at New York City.

her skillful fingers the plain house of pioneer days in Iowa speedily 
took on an air of neatness and cosy comfort. She possessed many of

NINTH GENERATION 965 

Hiram Bingham was fitted for college in Williston Seminary at 
Easthampton, Mass. ; graduated from Yale College in 1853 ; studied 
theology in Andover Seminary, and was ordained by the Congrega- 
tionalists, Nov. 9, 1856. He and his wife sailed from Boston, Mass., 
Dec. 2, 1856, for Micronesia, and landed at Apaiang, Gilbert Islands, 
N"ov. 18, 1857, as pioneer missionaries. Dr. Bingham was engaged 
in literary and evangelistic work for the Gilbert Islanders, spending 
a part of the time in the Gilbert Islands and part in Honolulu until 
1875, when he located at Honolulu, where he and Mrs. Bingham 
continued their labors as missionaries. 

During Dr. Bingham's prolonged missionary life he reduced to 
writing the Gilbertese language, prepared a grammar of the same. 
and a Gilbertese-English Dictionary of about 11,000 words; trans- 
lated the entire Bible into Gilbertese and carried it through the 
press of the American Bible Society; wrote a Gilbertese Bible Dic- 
tionary; compiled a Gilbertese Hymn and Tune Book, most of the 
hymns having been translated by him; edited a Gilbertese Com- 
mentary of the JSTew Testament, and his last work is a revision of 
the Gilbertese Bible, which represents the eighth edition. 

The degree of D. D. was conferred upon him by Yale and West- 
ern Eeserve Colleges in 1893, and by Oahu College, at Honolulu, in 
1897. 

Minerva Clarissa Brewster was educated in Williston Seminary, 
and she, as well as her husband, was a benefactor of humanity. Tlie 
following is an extract from her obituary : 

" The announcement of the death of Mrs. Hiram Bingham at 
Honolulu will recall to many minds a gracious, generously affection- 
ate woman, and a missionary service distinguished for whole-hearted- 
ness, ability and early hardships. . . . Her renunciation carried 
Mrs. Bingham all the way to Micronesia, and to barren savage 
Apaiang of the Gilbert Islands, where, for two years, she never saw 
the face of a white woman. . . . When compelled to leave the 
Gilberts, from her home in Honolulu she steadily pursued her aim 
by influential, practical efforts for her dear islanders. To say noth- 
ing of the assistance which she rendered her husband in his literary 
work, she prepared text books herself in Gilbertese — an arithmetic 
revised through five editions, a reader in seven editions, primary 
geography, higher geographay, brief notes on Job, and Bible read- 
ings — to help the Gilbertese women in their prayer meetings. Some 
of the proofsheets were read as the nurse held them before her eyes. 
. . . She had been a strength to the Union Church [Honolulu],

owner of the first quartz mill erected in that State. In 
June, 1852, he sailed for Australia, and after a voyage 
of seventy days arrived at Sydne}^ and for one year 
engaged successfully in mining operations in New South 
Wales. He then sailed from Melbourne, and after a voy- 
age of ninety days arrived at New York. 

" In the spring of 1860 he crossed the plains in the first 
tri-weekly coach for Colorado ; located in Gilpin County 
and again engaged in placer mining, employing a large

number of men. In 1870 he was one of the projectors 
and builders of the Colorado Central Eailroad, the first 
narrow gauge railroad to enter the Eocky Mountains, and 
after its completion was the first vice president and held 
the ofiice for many years. He was also a director in the 
Santa Fe Eailroad. In 1878 he opened a large coal mine 
in Boulder County, Colo., known as the ' Welch Coal 
Mine,' which he operated successfully for several years, 
then sold the property to Jay Gould of N"ew York, reserv- 
ing a royal interest. He was also the owner and manager 
of large ranches in the sugar beet and wheat region of 
Larimer County, Colo., raising one year fifty thousand 
bushels of grain. In 1873 Mr. Welch was elected to the 
Territorial Legislature from Golden, Jefferson County, 
Colo., where he resided for many years. He filled that 
position with credit to himself and benefit to his con- 
stituents. He introduced the bill in the Legislature to 
establish the State School of Mines at Golden, and gave 
the ground upon which the first building was erected, and 
for ten years he served as a member of the Board of Trus- 
tees. The Colorado School of Mines is the leading insti- 
tution of its kind in the United States, and was a grati- 
fying reward to Mr. Welch for his faithful work in its 
behalf in the early days. It is scarcely possible that there 
is a man in Colorado whose varied business and industrial 
affairs cover a wider range, or who has been more active 
in developing the material interests of the State than 
Mr. Welch. Before the railroads were built he crossed 
the plains nineteen times in coaches and wagons, on busi- 
ness trips of various kinds."

1203 MAEY MINERYA» BREWSTER (John', Oliver', Wads-

Pittsfield, Mass., September 3. 1851, GEORGE HII^MAN" LAFLIN, 
son of Matthew and Henrietta Armenia (Hinman) Laflin of Canton, 
Conn., born there, January 19, 1828; died at Pittsfield, July 24, 
1904. She died at Chicago, 111., January 10, 1902. 

George H. Laflin was a merchant at Chicago. 

The following is an extract from Mrs. Laflin's obituary in 
\Y Oman's Work for Woman: 

" The words of the first psalm seem most appropriate to the life 
of Mrs. Laflin, for, planted by the water-side, she brought forth fruit 
from her girlhood on. . . . Her education was received at Pitts- 
field, where was then one of the best schools for girls in the country. 
Her erect and dignified bearing, even at sixteen was noticeable; the 
mass of dark brown hair which crowned her head and her bright face 
and brilliant color made her the pride of her class and, indeed, of 
the whole school. Mrs. Laflin completed her course of study at 
eighteen and was married at nineteen, after which her home was for 
the most part in Chicago. . . , One of Mrs. Laflin's most con- 
spicuous gifts was the remarkable executive ability which she pos- 
sessed. This not only made her a leader in all the form_s of philan- 
thropic work in which she was engaged, but also brought happiness 
to her family and made her home, whether in city or country, very 
attractive to the privileged visitor. In her beautiful summer home 
at Pittsfield she loved to gather her children and grandchildren 
about her, never forgetting, year by year, some of whom this visit 
would bring the greatest pleasure of the season. Her servants were 
selected with judgment and carefully trained, remaining many years 
in her employ, until they seemed a part of the family. 

" In 1868 the Board of the Interior (now the Congregational 
Board, connected with the A. B. C. F. M.) was organized, with which 
the Presbyterians were then affiliated, and Mrs. Laflin was chosen 
recording secretary. She filled this office for two years, when the 
Board of the ISTorthwest was organized, of which she was chosen one 
of the two corresponding secretaries. For years the Board had no 
office and no clerks, the secretaries doing all the writing, which occu- 



1038 BREWSTER GENEALOGY 

pied a good part of every-day life. We early learned to depend upon 
Mrs. Laflin's methodical ways and her clear, condensed style of writ- 
ing, especially in the line of circular letters and annual reports. 
She resigned from the office of secretary in 1890, but remaining as 
one of our vice-presidents was ever a mainstay. Her labors on the 
Missionary Board by no means exhausted her splendid energy. For 
thirty years she was a leading spirit in the Home for the Friend- 
less, not neglecting, either, the claims of her own church, the First 
Presbyterian. Notwithstanding the prominence always awarded her 
by reason of her ability, she still retained a timidity which made her 
shrink from taking part in any meeting except as her strong sense of 
duty urged it upon her. Her whole life, indeed, was an unwavering 
allegiance to duty."

In 1839 John K. Brewster settled at Oneco, 111., and in 1849 he 
became a resident of Freeport, 111., and soon was ranked as one of its 
most successful citizens. He disposed of his interests at Freeport in 
1870, and removed to Colorado that year and to Canon City, as a 
representative of the D. and E. G. Railroad Company to piirchase land 
for its right-of-way, arriving November, 1870. On the termination 
of his connection with that company, he became the agent of the Cen- 
tral Colorado Improvement Company, which later became the Colo- 
rado Fuel and Iron Company, and in that capacity purchased a large 
amount of coal land in the county. He was instrumental in pro- 
curing for Canon City its present railroad facilities and, moro than 
anyone else, was responsible for the inauguration of the movement; to 
develop its coal resources. 

Mr. Brewster was a devoted, conscientious adherent of the Presby- 
terian Church; was one of the charter members of that organization 
in Canon City, and active in all its benevolences and enterprises. He 
was one of the first elders and held that office continuously until his 
death. His eighty-seventh birthday anniversary was commemorated 
at the First Presbyterian Church, a large number of his friends taking 
part in the celebration. Elder Brewster, who was in his eighty-eighth 
year at his death, was probably the oldest man in Canon City, and

win) FEAEY of Pulaski, N. Y., born at Evans, N. Y., March 23, 
1828. He died at Saint Louis, Mo., May 18, 1898. 

James V. Schofield attended Madison (N. Y.) University from 
1848-50; entered the University of Eoehester and was graduated 
from there with the degree of A. B., in 1852, and two years later 
graduated from the Theological Seminary of Eoehester, with the 
degree of B. D., and took charge of his first church, at Louisville, 
Ky.. where he was ordained and where he remained for four years. 
He then removed to Quincy, 111., where he was pastor of a Baptist 
church for four years. In 1862 Dr. Schofield became pastor of the 
Third Baptist Church of St. Louis, Mo., which then had a member- 
ship of eighty, worshiping in a chapel. Guided by his faith and 
energy they moved into a handsome house of worship built by them, 
and when he resigned in 1869, to accept a call at Des Moines, Iowa, 
he left his church one of the leading powers of the city. His pastor- 
ate in St. Louis covered the most critical period of the city's history, 
yet during all those years of excitement and strife his congregation 
stood undivided, due to Dr. Schofield's tact and sympathy as a pas- 
tor. He enjoyed a successful pastorate in Des Moines, an unfinished 
church being completed and the debt removed. In 1871 Dr. Scho- 
field accepted a call to the First Baptist Church of New Britain, 
Conn., and after four years, suffering from the climate, he returned 



NINTH GENERATION 1123 

to St. Louis and labored in the Fourth Baptist Church and in the 
establishment of an important mission. His last work was at Can- 
ton, Mo., where he performed the crowning labor of a life filled with 
good work, being then the oldest minister in active service in Mis- 
souri. During his pastorate a beautiful house of worship was built 
and here, as in every place where he lived, was felt a spiritual influ- 
ence, a marked characteristic of his ministry, elevating the commu- 
nity to a higher plane of Christian charity and brotherhood. 

Dr. Schofield was widely known throughout his denomination as 
a man of fine thought, impressive and eloquent. During his minis- 
try he baptized over seven hundred persons. 

The degree of D. D. was conferred upon him by LaG range of 
Missouri and by the University of Chicago in 1881.

Holmes Chambers* and Harriet (Whitehorne) BAETLETT of 
West Point, born at Newport, E. I., October 1, 1833; died at Wash- 
ington, D. C, December 24, 1888 ; married second, at Keokuk, Iowa.

John M. Schofield entered the United States Military Academy, 
West Point, N. Y., June 1, 1849, and was graduated July 1, 1853, 
in the class with McPherson, Sill and Sheridan, who, like himself, 
afterwards became famous on the Union side in the Civil War. In 

* W. H. C. Bartlett was graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 
1S22. For nearly half a century he was professor of Natural and Experi- 
mpntal Philosophy in that academy, and was president of the Academic 
Board of West Point. 



NINTH GENERATION 1125 

that class, too, was General Thomas M. Vincent, his " beloved class- 
mate," afterwards the able and energetic assistant to Secretary of 
War Stanton, while on the Confederate side the class was repre- 
sented by General John B. Hood, Schofield's antagonist at Franklin 
in 1864. 

Cadet Schofield was appointed brevet second lieutenant and pro- 
moted to second lieutenant and first lieutenant prior to the outbreak 
of the war. While holding the rank of second lieutenant he was 
assigned to duty at the Military Academy as assistant professor of 
Natural and Experimental Philosophy, and on his promotion to first 
lieutenant was assigned as principal assistant professor of Philos- 
ophy at the Academy until August 28, 1860, when he accepted the 
chair of Physics in Washington University at Saint Louis, Mo. 

In the Civil War, from beginning to end. General Schofield was 
at the front, taking advantage of every opportunity that presented 
to preserve the Union. He was chief of staff to General Lyon in 
the early operations in Missouri and in the battle of Wilson's Creek, 
August 10, 1861 (in which General Lyon was killed), and was 
awarded a Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry in the battle. 
He was appointed brigadier general of Yolunteers November 21, 
1861, and brigadier general of Missouri Militia on the same date, 
and was assigned to command the District of ]\Iissouri February 
loth. In September, 1862, he organized the Army of the Frontier, 
drivincr Hindman out of Southwest Missouri and south of the Ar- 
kansas Eiver. 

In the latter part of 1863 and in 1863 he was assigned to impor- 
tant administrative and military commands. He had been appointed 
major general of Volunteers to date from November 29, 1862. but 
having incurred the enmity of some political generals his nomina- 
tion was not confirmed. In May, 1863, however, President Lincoln 
reappointed him major general of Volunteers of the same date as 
his original appointment, and assigned him to command the Depart- 
ment of the Missouri. In January, 1864, he was sent to Knoxville 
to command the Department and Army of the Ohio. 

On May 2, 1864, General Schofield joined General Sherman, and 
his army became the left wing of Sherman's army, and in the long 
and brilliant campaign that followed he was a trusted adviser of 
General Sherman and possessed his utmost confidence. He partici- 
pated with his command and was conspicuous in all the engagements 
and operations of that ever memorable campaign ending in the cap- 
ture of Atlanta, Georgia. 



112G BREWSTER GENEALOGY 

When General Sherman started on his " March to the Sea " he 
left General Schofield with his command to help General Thomas 
"take care of Hood" in Tennessee. General Schofield was then in 
immediate command of the troops opposed to Hood, General Thomas 
being at ISTashville organizing and concentrating his command. When 
Hood crossed the Tennessee and advanced towards ISTashville, Gen- 
eral Schofield with a greatly inferior force retarded his advance by 
skillful maneuvering from the 24th to the 30th of ISTovember, 1864, 
when was fought the decisive battle of Franklin, in which Hood was 
badly defeated. For this battle General Schofield was promoted to 
brigadier general and to brevet major general in the Eegular Army. 
On December 15th and 16th, having joined General Thomas, he com- 
manded his corps in the battle of Nashville and the subsequent pur- 
suit of Hood. 

In January, 1865, General Schofield with his command was trans- 
ferred to North Carolina. On February 28th he assumed command 
of the Department of North Carolina and the Army of the Oliio. 
Operations were at once begun, resulting in the capture of Fort 
Anderson February 19th, Wilmington February 22d, battle of Kins- 
ton March 8th-10th, and the march to Goldsboro, where he united 
with General Sherman March 22d, and was present with him in the 
second interview with General Joseph E. Johnston, when he surren- 
dered at Durham Station, North Carolina, March 22, 1865, General 
Schofield being entrusted with the execution of the military conven- 
tion of capitulation. 

In June, 1865, General Schofield was sent on a delicate and im- 
portant secret mission to France in connection with the peaceful 
evacuation of Mexico by the French. 

Under the Eeconstruction Laws he commanded the First Military 
District (Virginia). 

From June 1, 1868, to March 10, 1869, he was Secretarv of War 
under President Johnson and President Grant, and was appointed 
major general, U. S. Army, March 4, 1869, and commanded several 
important military divisions and departments until August, 1888, 
when, on the death of General Sheridan, he was appointed to com- 
mand the Army of the United States. He was appointed lieutenant 
general of the United States Army February 5, 1895, and having 
reached the age of sixty-four years was retired September 29, 1895. 
By special act of Congress he was created a lieutenant general, being 
the sixth to hold rank above major general — Washington. Scott, 
Grant, Sherman, Sheridan and Schofield.

and a statesman. His knowledge while varied was profound, and he 
patrioticaHy served his country with marked distinction for nearly 
half a century and during a most momentous epoch.

terms, and was a member of the George Washington Post of the

NINTH GENERATION 1137 

" Clark Dimham exhibited in a marked degree the Puritan charac- 
teristics of his ancestors — their independence, self-reliance, and per- 
sistence were his also. After working his way through college at 
Granville, Ohio, he commenced an editorial career at the age of 
twenty. Later he removed from Newark, Ohio, to Burlington, Iowa, 
and, one might say, gave his life to the Hawheye, for his labor on 
that paper during the Civil War impaired his health. He was known 
throughout the State as Iowa's War Editor."

S. and Elizabeth (Allen) JOHNSON of Beloit. born at Granville, 
Mass., October 30, 1837. He died at Beloit, March 11, 1907. 

Clinton Babbitt was educated in Keene (N. H.) Academy. Ee- 
moving to Beloit in early manhood, he became a member of the first 
City Council, as alderman, in 1853. He served as postmaster of 
Beloit from 1886-90, and was a member of the 52d Congress from the 
First District of Wisconsin. He was known throughout the State 
as a breeder of blooded stock and interested in improving the industry 
of agriculture, serving as secretary of the State Agricultural Society 
from 1885-90. 

A short sketch does not suffice to show the amplitude of Mr. Bab- 
bitt's life. ' It consisted more in what he was than what he did, 
more in influence than in offices, more than is usual in " little unre- 
membered acts of kindness and of love." During his long life he 
was a careful student of public men and measures. He was a power-

selor of political leaders. His home was open daily to wanderers or 
to notables, and around his board met the great democracy of man- 
kind. When he died the city mourned, the city's flag went to half-

of the war, and although not commissioned, they did commendable 
work in caring for the sick and wounded. During his pastorate the

Committee of the Board of Ministerial Aid. He is a member of the 
New England Historic Genealogical Society and a life member of 
the General Theological Library of Boston. 

The degree of D. D. was conferred upon him by Olivet College in 
1868, and by Dartmouth College in 1870.

Review of Sabhath Hymn and Tune Booh; Our Nation Under the 
Government of God; Christianity and Our Civil Institutions; A 
Review of Dr. Allen's Biography of Jonathan Edwards, also various 
addresses and magazine articles. He made an argument before the 
Board of Visitors of Andover Theological Seminary on the famous 
Andover case, which was published in a volume called The Andover 
Case, and he prepared a second argument, which was published, called 
The Questions at Issue in the Andover Case. 

Mrs. Wellman was educated in an academy at West Eandolph,

Eoyal B. Bradford is a naval officer, having attained the rank of 
rear admiral. He retired from active service July 22, 1906, under 
the statute requiring all naval officers to do so at the age of sixty-two 
years. At that time the leading service newspaper. The Army and 
Navy Journal, published substantially the following account of his 
services. 

The transfer of Eear Admiral Eoyal B. Bradford to the retired 
list of the U. S. Navy withdraws from active service an officer whose 
career has been characterized by rare ability, high professional zeal 
and constant usefulness. 

As a midshipman at the Naval Academy, which he entered No- 
vember 28, 1861, and from which he graduated number three in the 
class of 1865, consisting of 54 members, he served in the ships John 
Adams, Macedonian, Marion, America, Marhlehead and Winnipeg, 
some of which cruised up and down the coast in search of Confederate 
cruisers. 

In 1865-66 he served on board of the Sivatara in the North At- 
lantic and West Indies as watch officer and engineer. In 1866 he 
also served in the Rhode Island, flagship of the North Atlantic 
Squadron, as watch officer. Was promoted to ensign December 1, 
1866. He was attached to the Iroquois, Asiatic Station, 1867-69, 
as watch officer and navigator; promoted to master March 12, 1868;

to lieutenant March 26, 18G9. Served on board of the Delaware, 
flagship of the Asiatic Squadron, 1869-70. At the U. S. Torpedo 
Station, Newport, E. I., 1872-73, under instruction and as instructor. 
He commenced at this period to make a special study of electricity, 
chemistry, explosives and torpedo warfare, as applied to his profes- 
sion, with the result that his services as a member of many techni- 
cal boards and commissions were thenceforth in much demand. At- 
tached to the Wahash and Franldin, flagships of the European Squad- 
ron, as watch officer and navigator, 1873-75. Instructor in Torpedo 
Warfare at the U. S. Torpedo Station, 1875-76. Executive officer 
of the Alliance, European Station, 1877-80. Promoted to lieutenant 
commander November 30, 1878. Instructor in Torpedo Warfare at 
the Torpedo Station, 1880-83. Executive officer of the Trenton, flag- 
ship of the Asiatic Squadron, 1883-85. The Trenton was the first 
man-of-war in the world to be lighted by electricity, which was done 
under his supervision. On special duty at Newport, E. I., 1885-87, 
organizing a department of electricity for naval purposes and pre- 
paring a book of new naval regulations. Served as the first inspector 
of naval electrical appliances. Was detailed as assistant to the chief 
of the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, November 1, 1887. 
Promoted to commander March 26, 1889. Commanded the Ben- 
nington, 1891-93, taking part in the demonstration against Chili 
in 1892, and participating in the Columbus anniversary celebrations 
in Europe and the naval review at home. Was on duty in Washing- 
ton as a member of the Board of Inspection and Survey and other 
technical boards, 1893-96. Commanded the Montgomery, North At- 
lantic Station, 1896-97. 

He was appointed by President McKinley, September 7, 1897, 
chief of the Bureau of Equipment, Navy Department, with the rel- 
ative rank of commodore. He resigned his commission as chief of 
bureau April 21, 1898, the day war was declared against Spain, and 
requested to be assigned to duty afloat. His resignation was not 
accepted and he was appealed to in writing by the Secretary of the 
Navy, on patriotic grounds and in the interests of the G-overnment, 
to remain in charge of the Bureau of Equipment, thus foregoing the 
opportunity of possible distinction in command at sea. He served 
as chief of bureau during the Spanish War; supplied the fleet with 
coal and performed the other onerous duties of that position in time 
of a maritime war. In September, 1898, he was appointed, by Pres- 
ident McKinley, naval attache of the Paris Peace Commission. His 
testimony in connection with the value of the Philippine Archipelago

for commercial and naval purposes forms part of the printed pro- 
ceedings of that commission. Promoted to captain, and advanced 
to the rank of rear admiral while chief of bureau, March 3, 1899. 
Appointed a member of the General Board of War Plans, Admiral 
George Dewey, president, July, 1901. His appointment as chief 
of bureau terminating by law at the expiration of four years, in 
1901, he was reappointed to that office for four years by President 
Roosevelt. During the entire period of holding the office of chief 
of bureau he was a member of the Naval Board on Construction, 
which board is responsible for the designs of ships of war. He 
resigned his commission as chief of Bureau of Equipment October 20, 
1903, having held that office longer than any of his predecessors, 
and requested assignment to service afloat. Upon terminating his 
connection with the management of the affairs of the Navy Depart- 
ment he received very flattering letters of commendation from the 
President and Secretary of the Navy. Commanded the battleship 
Illinois from October, 1903, to November, 1904. Commander-in- 
chief of the Atlantic Training Squadron from November, 1904, to 
April, 1905. Commander of the Third Squadron, Atlantic Fleet, 
from April, 1905, to July, 1906. 

" From the foregoing outline it will be seen that Admiral Brad- 
ford's professional career has been one of manifold activities, involv- 
ing large responsibilities and requiring the broadest training and 
experience. It is a simple statement of the truth to say that he 
has proved equal to every task to which he has been assigned; that 
he has realized the highest ideals of the American Navy officer, 
and that the Service, which he has adorned, has been enriched by his 
example and influence." 

All of Admiral Bradford's ancestors trace back to the early colo- 
nists of Massachusetts.

there received his business training, finally becoming the junior

He left this position in 1863 to become a volunteer aide in the 
Civil War, and joined the Army of the Tennessee the same year. 
Just preceding the capture of Atlanta, in 1864, he returned to New 
York City on sick leave, and, after having a severe attack of typhoid 
fever, he was too weak to return to the service. While regaining 
his strength he engaged in the life insurance business, intending to 
remain in it only a month, but, succeeding beyond his expectations, 
it became his life work. Mr. Reynolds next located at Milwaukee, 
Wis., as general agent for two states for the Manhattan Life Insur- 
ance Company, and, after five years' service there, he became the 
general agent for the State of Pennsylvania for the Union Mutual 
Life Insurance Company, with residence at Philadelphia. In

Concerning WRESTLING BREWSTER, the youngest son of Elder 
William, Governor Bradford says he " dyed a yonge man vnmaried " 
(see page 7). There is, however, a tradition that between 1627 and 
1629 Wrestling Brewster settled where Portsmouth, N. H., now stands ; 
in 1629 he bought land near the Portsmouth Plains; in 1630, married 
EMILA, daughter of Augustine STORY; had children— i John, b. 
Jan. 20, 1631, ii Lovee Lucretia, b. May 3, 1636, and that Wres- 
tling was living in 1638. 

The son, John, married July 6, 1752, Mary, daughter of Roger 
Knight, Esq., and had an only son, John, who had issue, many of 
whose descendants settled in New Hampshire. 



APPENDIX B 

The problem, upon which numerous genealogists haA^e been work- 
ing for many years, concerning the parentage of the Eeverend 
Nathaniel Brewster of Brookhaven, L. I., has not been solved. Were 
it not for the statement that he was " aged seventy years " when he 
died in 1690, therefore born in 1620, he might perhaps have been 
a son of Jonathan- Brewster {Elder William^) and the wife who 
was buried at Leyden, Holland, May 10, 1619. See pages 11-13. 

1 Eeverend NATHANIEL^ BEEWSTER, B. D., married 
SAEAH, daughter of Eoger LUDLOW, " deputy governor of Massa- 
chusetts and Connecticut," and he died at Setucket, L. L, December 
18, 1690, "aged seventy years." There is a tradition that Nathaniel 
Brewster married first, ABIGAIL EEYNES (?), and that there 
were children of both wives. 

The Eev. Nathaniel Brewster was graduated from Harvard Uni- 
versity in 1642, the first class graduated at Harvard; went to Eng- 
land and settled at Abby in County Norfolk; received the degree of 
B. D. from Dublin University ; returned to this country " after the 
restoration"; preached at the First Church in Boston in 1653, and 
settled at Brookhaven, L. I., in 1655. 

Many of his descendants of the early generations settled in Suf- 
folk and Orange counties, New York, and numerous descendants 
of the present generation are located in many sections of this country, 
especially in the States of New York and New Jersey. 

Children (there may have heen other children) : 
i JOHN^. 

>■ Survived their father. 



ii Timothy. 
iii Daniel.
