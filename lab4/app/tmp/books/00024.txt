Introductory Note 



This, the fourth volume of Abstracts of Wills of New Jer- 
sey, includes wills, admix _ uardianships app 
ing on the records in Trenton as tiled or recorded from Jan. 
i. 1761. to December 31, 1770. a period of ten years. The 
abstracts were made by Dr. Joseph H. Satterthwaite. of Tren- 
ton and the Index under superintendence of the Editor. 

First dates in boldface type are often prior to 1760. and 
indicate when the will to which the date refers was executed 
(not probated). The name so printed is ac g \ the 

■-.ature to the will, however it may differ in the text I 
follows. 

All proper names of persons and places are believed to be 
printed as in the originals. This early period was one. however, 
when names were spelled so indifferently that the reader m 
have to consider various ways of spelling in order to discover 
certain of the surnames. 

The Index does not repeat the surnames of those whose 
wills, etc.. are abstracted, except in the instances where al- 
ternative spellings, in parentheses, are so extremely diver, 
from the alphab --.ngement that they may not be other- 

wise discovered. But neither first nor alternative spel' 
can always be considered to be correct spellir_- "ding to 

modern usages. 

This publication is madej possible by Legislative appropria- 
tion.
