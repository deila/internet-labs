THE VERSES ARE BY VARIOUS WRITERS

^- 



MY READERS, would you like to go abroad, for just an hour or so, 
With little friends of different ages ? Look at them in these pictured pages 
Brothers and sisters you can see, all children of one family. 
Their father, too, you here will find, and good Miss Earle, their teacher kind. 
Three years ago their Mother died, and ever since has Father tried 
To give his children in the Spring some tour, or treat, or pleasant thing. 
Said he, last Easter, " I propose, for Nellie, Dennis, Mabel, Rose, 
A trip abroad to go with me to Paris and through Normandy." 
Then all exclaimed, " Oh ! glorious ! " " But may not Bertie go with us ? " 
Said Rose "We can't leave him at home." Then Father said he too should come. 
Turn to the Frontispiece and see the children packing busily. 
The next page shows them in the station at Charing Cross. Their great elation 
Is written plainly on their faces. Bell rings "Time's up Come, take your places '." 



The "Folkestone Express" sped on like a dream, 
And there lay the steamer fast getting up steam. 





^^T/^K 1 ' 
W&& W* 




TH E N at the Folkestone harbour, down they go 
Across the gangway to the boat below ; 
Mabel and Rose just crossing you can see, 
Each holding her new doll most carefully. 



Nellie, Miss Earle, and Bertie too appear, 
Whilst Dennis, with the rugs, brings up the rear. 
May looks behind her with an anxious air, 
Lest Father, at the last, should not be there. 



Our children once on board, all safe and sound, 
Watch with delight the busy scene around. 
The noisy steam-pipe blows and blows away, 
" Now this is just the noise we like," they say. 



But while the turmoil loud and louder grows, 
" I'm glad the wind blows gently," whispers Rose. 
And as the steamer swiftly leaves the quay, 
Mabel and Dennis almost dance with glee. 




CROSSING THE CHANNEL. 

THE sea is calm, and clear the sky only a few clouds scudding by : 
The Passengers look bright, and say, " Are we not lucky in the day ! " 
The Mate stands in the wheelhouse there, and turns the wheel with watchful care 
Steering to-day is work enough ; what must it be when weather 's rough ? 
Look at him in his sheltered place he hasn't got a merry face 
Tis not such fun for him, you know, he goes so often to and fro. 
Nellie and Father, looking back, glance at the vessel's lengthening track 
" How far," says Nellie, "we have come ! good-bye, good-bye, dear English home ! ' 
Dennis and Rose and Mabel, walking upon the deck, are gaily talking 
Says Mabel, " No one must forget to call my new doll 'Antoinette'; 
Travelling in France, 'twould be a shame for her to have an English name." 
Says Dennis, " Call her what you will, so you be English 'Mabel ' still. 
Says Rose, to Dennis drawing nigher, " I think the wind is getting higher ; " 
" If a gale blows, do you suppose, we shall be wrecked? " asks little Rose." 




WHILE chatting with Dennis, Rose lost all her fear ; 
And the swift Albert Victor came safe to the pier 
At Boulogne, where they landed, and there was the train 
Jn waiting to take up the travellers again. 
But to travel so quickly was not their intent : 
On a little refreshment our party was bent. 
Here they are at the Buffet for dinner they wait 
And the tall garspn, Andre, attends them in state. 



HI 



At a separate table sits Monsieur Legros, 

And behind him his poodle, Fidele, you must know, 

Who can dance, he's so clever, and si and on his head, 

Or upon his nose balance a morsel of bread. 

Mabel takes up some sugar to coax him, whilst Nell 

Calls him to her Fidele understands very well 

"Why! he must have learnt English, he knows what we say," 

Mabel cries, " See! he begs in the cleverest way." 



THEM to the Hotel on the quay they all went ; 
To remain till the morrow they all were content 
After so much fatigue Father thought it was best, 
For the children were weary and needed the rest. 
Pictured here is the room in that very Hotel, 
Where so cosily rested Rose, Mabel, and Nell. 



ili 









Mabel dreamed of the morrow of buying French toys : 
Rose remembered the steam-pipe, and dreamed of its noise. 
Nellie's dreams were of home, but she woke from her trance 
Full of joy, just to think they were really in France. 

Very early next morning, you see them all three 
Looking out from their window that faces the sea. 




14 



THE FIRST MORNING IN FRANCE. 



TJ ERE they see a P^tty sight, 
* Sunny sky and landscape bright : 
Fishing-boats move up and down, 
With their sails all red and brown. 

Some to land are drawing near, 
O'er the water still and clear, 
Full of fish as they can be, 
Caught last night in open sea. 

On the pavement down below, 
Fishwives hurry to and fro, - 
Calling out their fish to sell 
" What a noisy lot," says Nell, 

" What a clap clap clap they make 
With their shoes each step they take. 
Wooden- shoes, I do declare, 
And oh ! what funny caps they wear! " 



After breakfast all went out 
To view the streets, and walk about 
The ancient city-walls, so strong, 
Where waved the English flag for long. 

Toy shops too they went to see, 
Spread with toys so temptingly : 
Dolls of every kind were there, 
With eyes that shut and real hair 

And, in a brightly-coloured row, 
Doll-fisherfolk like these below. 
Prices marked, as if to say, 
" Come and buy us, quick, to-day ! " 

One for Mabel, one for Rose, 
Two for Bertie I suppose, 
Father bought. Then all once more 
Set off travelling as before. 




'T*O Rouen next they went, that very day, Dennis bought chocolate to make a feast 

* And heard strange places called out by the way, They had three dinners in the train, at least. 

Where bells kept tinkling while the train delayed : At Rouen here they are at last, though late 

At Amiens ten minutes quite they stayed. The bedroom clock there shows 'tis after eight ! 




Mabel looks tired she lies back in her chair 
Beside the wood fire burning brightly there. 
Rose says " Good-night !" to Bertie fast asleep, 
While her own eyes can scarcely open keep. 



Next morning, through the quaint old streets of Rouen 
They went to see the old church of Saint Ouen, 
With eager feet, and chatting as they walked, 
About the ancient Town, together talked. 



1 6 



SAID Dennis, first, 
" This city bold 
Belonged to us 

In days of old." 
Said Nellie, " Here 

Prince Arthur wept 
By cruel John 

A prisoner kept. 
Here Joan of Arc 

Was tried and burned 
When fickle fate 

Against her turned." 
Said Rose, " Oh dear ! 

It makes me sad 
To think what trouble 

People had 
Who lived once in 

This very town, 
Where we walk gaily 

Up and down." 





NOW they have come into the entrance wide 
Of great St. Ouen's Church ; see, side by side, 
Dennis and Nellie going on before: 
The others watch yon beggar at the door 
Poor blind Pierre; he always waits just so, 
Listening for those who come and those who go. 
He tells his beads, and hopes all day that some 
May think of him, 'mongst those who chance to come. 
Though he can't see, he is so quick to hear, 
He knows a long, long time ere one draws near, 
And shakes the coppers in his well-worn tin 
" Click, click," it goes see, Bertie's gift drops in. 
'Tis his one sou that Bertie gives away 
It might have bought him sweets this very day. 
When through St. Ouen's Church they 'd been at last, 
Along its aisles and down its transept passed, 
They went to the Cathedral, there to see 
The tomb of Rolf, first Duke of Normandy. 
But Mabel said, " Why should we English care 
About that Rolf they say was buried there?" 
Then she ran on, not waiting for reply 
My little reader, can you tell her why ? 



Cathedral was cold, 
With its dim solemn aisles 
But outside our friends found 
The sun waiting, with smiles, 
To show them their way, 
So hither they came 
Along an old street 
With a hard French name, 



And still walking onward, 
Through streets we can't see, 
At length reached the Creche 
Of "Sceur Rosalie" 
Where poor women's children 
Are kept all day through, 
Amused, taught, and tended, 
And all for one sou. 




pHILDREN are happy with "Sister" all day, 
v_y Mothers can't nurse them they work far away. 
Good Sister Rosalie, she is so kind, 

^ E'en when they're troublesome, she doesn't mind. 

Here in the first room the Babies we see, sitting at dejeuner round Rosalie. 



Dodo is crying, he can't find his spoon some one will find it and comfort him soon. 
Over yon cradle bends kind Sister Claire, v 

Dear little Mimi is waking up there. 
Sister Felicite', sweetly sings she, 
" Up again, down again, BeM, to me."

THE school-room of the Creche is wide, 
The children sit there, side by side, 
While "Sister" hears their lessons through, 
And when there 's no more work to do 
They all get up, and form a ring, 
And as they stand, together sing. 
Now hand in hand, tramp, tramp they go, 
Now in a line march to and fro, 
For with the rattle in her hand 
The " Sister " makes them understand 
When to advance and when draw back 
Click-clack it goes, click -clack, click-clack. 
On Stephanie now turn your eyes, 
She 's only five, but she 's so wise 
She knows the alphabet all through, 
And, more than that, can teach it too. 
Just now, she moves her wand to J, 
And tells the children what to say. 
But 'tis no use to tell Ninette, 
For she is but a bebe yet.

ARRIVAL AT CAEN. 




'T^HROUGH Rouen when our friends had been, 
And all its famous places seen, 
They travelled on, old Caen to see, 
Another town in Normandy. 

Arrived at Caen, the travellers here 
Before the chief Hotel appear, 
Miss Earle, Rose, Bertie you descry 
The rest are coming by-and-by. 

Monsieur le Maitre, with scrape and bow, 
Stands ready to receive them now, 

And Madame with her blandest air, 

And their alert Commissionaire. 



\TEXT up the staircase see them go, 
* ' Wiih/emme de chambre the way to show. 
Father and Dennis, standing there, 
Are asking for the bill of fare. 

Momieur le Maitie, who rubs his hands 
And says, " What are Monsieur's commands ? ' 
With scrape and bow, again you see 
The most polite of men is he.

\TOW that dinner is ordered, we '11 just take a peep 
^ At the cooks in the kitchen just see ! what a heap 
Of plates are provided, and copper pans too ; 
They '11 soon make a dinner for me and for you. 
French cookery 's famous for flavouring rare, 
But of garlic I think they've enough and to spare. 



iftl/ifcm 



^ 



If we ask how their wonderful dishes are made, 
I 'm afraid they won't tell us the tricks of the trade. 
Do they make them, I wonder, of frogs and of snails ? 
Or are these, after all, only travellers' tales ? 
The names are all down on the " Menu," no doubt, 
But the worst of it is that we can't make them out. 



IT ERE the children 
* * 



Came next morn, 
Walking by 

The river Orne ; 
Near the poplars 

On the green, 
Where the Washerwives 

Are seen. 
Here they looked 

At old Nannette, 
Wringing out 

The garments wet ; 
Saw how Eugenie, 

Her daughter, 
Soaked them first 

In running water; 
Watched the washers 

Soaping, scrubbing, 
With their mallets 

Rubbing, drubbing 
Working hard 

With all their might, 
Till the clothes 

Were clean and white. 




L'HOMME qui passe," in France they call 
The man who thrives 
By grinding knives 
Who never stays at home at all, 

But always must be moving on. 

He 's glad to find 

Some knives to grind, 
But when they're finished he'll be gone. 

With dog behind to turn the wheel, 

He grinds the knife 

For farmer's wife, 
And pauses now the edge to feel : 

The dog behind him hears the sound 
Of cheerful chat 
On this and that, 

And fears no knife is being ground. 



THE 

KNIFE-GRINDER 
OF CAEN. 



The man makes jokes with careless smile, 

He doesn't mind 

The dog behind, 
But goes on talking all the while. 




CHOCOLATE AND MILK. 

T ITTLE Lili, whose age isn't three years quite, 

-L' Went one day with Mamma for a long country walk, 

Keeping up, all the time, such a chatter and talk 

Of the trees, and the flowers, and the cows, brown and white. 

Soon she asked for some cake, and some chocolate too, 

For this was her favourite lunch every day 

" Dear child," said Mamma, "let me see I dare say 



A TOUT 
HEURL 






' 

^t^rQ, 



" If I ask that nice milkmaid, and say it 's for you, 

Some sweet milk we can get from her pretty white cow." 

" I would rather have chocolate," Lili averred. 

Then Mamma said, " Dear Lili, please don't be absurd ; 

My darling, you cannot have chocolate now : 

You know we can't get it so far from the town. 

Come and stroke the white cow, see, her coat 's soft as silk. 

" But, Mamma," Lili said, " if the White cow gives milk, 

Then chocolate surely must come from the Brown" 



LACE MAKERS OF CAEN 



IN many a lowly cottage in France 
The bobbins keep threading a mazy dance 
The whole day long, from morning to night, 
Weaving the lace so pretty and light 
How swiftly the nimble fingers twist 
The threads on the pillow not one is missed : 
Each bobbin would seem to rise from its place 
To meet the fingers that form the lace. 
How wondrously quick the pattern shows 
From the threads, as under our eyes it grows : 
How quickly follow stem, leaves, and flower, 
As if under the spell of enchanter's power. 
Look at old Nannette she can scarcely see, 
Yet none can make lovelier lace than she; 
And her grand-daughter Julie just seven years old, 
Is learning already the bobbins to hold. 
Without drawings to follow, or patterns to trace, 
How can these poor cottagers fashion their lace? 
From the plant and the flower and unfolding fern 
And the frost on the pane their patterns they learn,- 
From gossamer web by the spider wove, 
From natural taste and natural love 
For every form of beauty and grace, 
They Ve learned to fashion their wonderful lace. 



s 






>c^ 



FOR Paris quite an early start 
They made the following day, 
And out of windows every one 
Kept looking, all the way. 
And many a pretty road like this 
The train went whizzing past, 
Where gatekeeper, with flag and horn, 
Stood by the gates shut fast. 
That's Marie you see standing there : 
Now, do you wonder why 
A woman has to blow the horn 
Before the train goes by? 
Her husband is a lazy man, 
He's in his cottage near, 
He would not stir a step, although 
The train will soon be here. 
And Marie called him, " Paul, be quick - 
Go shut the gate," she cried 
" Don't hurry me, there's time enough," 
The lazy man replied. 
So Marie had to go, you see, 
And take the horn, and blow. 
And every day it's just the same, 
She always has to go. 




EN ROUTE 

BLATTER ! clatter ! on they go, 

Past stream and gentle valley, 
Until the engine wheels turn slow, 
And stop at length to dally 



For dinner-time full half-an-hour 
Within a crowded station, 

While hungry little mouths devour 
The tempting cold collation 




Spread in the dining-room at hand ; 

And then, when that is finished, 
The children sally in a band, 

With appetites diminished, 



To look at all the folk they meet, And all the other folk that make The engine puffs away they fly, 

The porters in blue blouses, A crowd in France amusing : And soon leave all behind them ; 

The white-robed priests, the nuns so neat. Till hark! their places all must take, Now turn the page, and you and I 
The farmers and their spouses, Without a minute losing. In Paris safe will find them. 





PARIS, gay Pai<^ ! so bright and so fair, 

Your sun is all smiles, and there 's mirth in your air. 



The children, though tired with their travelling, found 
That the first night in Paris one's sleep is not sound, 
For the hum of the streets makes one dream all the night 
Of the wonderful sights that will come with the light. 

The morning was fine, and breakfast despatched 

They soon made their way to the Gardens attached 

To the old Royal Palace, and there met a throng 

Of French children, and joined in their games before long. 

One boy lent his hoop, and gave Bertie a bun. 
And talking quite fast seemed to think it great fun 
With nice English girls like our Nellie to play, 
Though not understanding a word she might say. 

On leaving the Gardens, the party were seated 

Outside of a caft, and there Papa treated 

Them all to fine ices and chocolate too ; 

They could hardly tell which was the nicer could you ? 



Paris, gay Paris, 

So bright and so fair ! 
Your sun is all smiles. 

And there 's mirth in your air ! 




35 



IN THE TUILERIES GARDENS. 



T N the Tuileries gardens, each afternoon, 
A little old man comes walking along : 
Now watch what happens ! for just as soon 
As they see him, the birds begin their song, 
And flutter about his hands and head, 
And perch on his shoulder quite at their ease, 
For he fills his pockets with crumbs of bread 
To feed his friends who live in the trees, 
And well they know he loves them so 
That into his pockets they sometimes go. 



But hark to what } s going on over there ! 
'Tis surely a Punch-and-Judy man, 
Making old Judy, I do declare, 
Talk French as fast as ever she can ! 
And I think, from the looks of poor Mr. P., 
He 's getting it hot from his scolding wife; 
But just wait a minute, and then you '11 see 
He'll beat her within an inch of her life. 
Walk in ! take a seat and you'll see her beat, 
And a penny is all you pay for the treai. 






WHERE shall we go to next? they still would say, 
And still they found new pleasures every day. 
At times Miss Earle took Bertie for a ride, 
With little Rose and Mabel side by side; 
And then their father took the elder two 
To see the picture galleries, and view 
Historic buildings, where they sometimes rested, 
And many a bit of history was suggested. 
They saw a wedding at the Madeleine, 
Then went to " Notre Dame," close by the Seine, 
And climbed the lofty tower, to see the view 
Which cannot be surpassed the whole world through. 
One day their father took them all to see 
A great museum, full as full could be 
Of rare old furniture, of every kind 
The artists of the " Middle Age " designed ; 
And precious things in silver and in gold, 
Made by the best artificers of old. 
Now while another way the party's eyes 
Are turned, " King Henry's Staircase " Bertie spies, 
And climbing up, with help from sister May, 
He calls to Dennis, when he gets half-way, 
" Come catch me quick ! " and then runs off, with peals 
Of merry laughter, Dennis at his heels. 





39 



T) ERTIE was first. " I 've won the race," he cried ; 
J3 But soon upon his lips the triumph died, 
And Bertie back in fear to Dennis ran : 
"Oh Dennis, look ! I ran against that man ! 
He shook and rattled so, and wagged his head, 
And gave me such a fright ! " " Pooh ! " Dennis said, 
" He will not hurt ! " And then he made a bow: 
Good-bye, old soldier, we must leave you now. 
VTEXT afternoon, while at the Zoo', a little tale they heard 
1\ Of the elephant that's there, and you shall hear it word for word.

TV jl UMBO and Jumbo, two elephants great, 

*'* From India travelled, and lived in state, 

In Paris the one, and in London the other : 

Now Mumbo and Jumbo were sister and brother. 

A warm invitation to Jumbo came, 

To cross the Atlantic and spread his fame. 

Said he, " I really don't want to go 

But then, they're so pressing! I can't say No!" 




So away to America Jumbo went, 
But his sister Mumbo is quite content 
To stay with the children of Paris, for she 
Is as happy an elephant as could be : 
" I 've a capital house, quite large and airy 
Close by live the Ostrich and Dromedary, 
And we see our young friends every day," said she 
"Oh, \\ here is the Zoo' that would better suit me?

A STEADY steed is Mumbo, if just a trifle slow; 
Upon her back you couldn't well a-steeple-chasing go : 
But other opportunities there are to have a ride, 
For there's a stud of ponies, and a camel to bestride 
A cart that's drawn by oxen can accommodate a few, 




And if such queer conveyances don't please you at the Zoo', 
There are little tramway cars too, with seats on either side, 
Which will take you through the gardens, and through the Bois beside :- 
Take the ticket on the other page, and with it you may go 
From the lake within the garden to the gate that's called Maillot. 





IE SWANS 



O O ! pretty swans, 
Do you know, in our Zoo' 
The swans of old England 
Are just like you ?" 



" Don t tejl me ! 

Said a cross old bird ; 
" I know better, 

The thing 's quite absurd 



;i Their figures, I 'in sure, 
Are not worth a glance : 

If you want to see style, 
You must come to France 



With a scornful whisk 
The swan turned tail, 

Spread its wings to the breeze 
And was off full-sail. 



" Ho ! pretty swan, 

Do you know, in our Zo 

The swans are not half 
So conceited as you ? "

LOOK at Mere Victorine 
At her stall in the street 
With the lily and rose, 
And the white marguerite, 
She makes pretty bouquets 
The whole of the day : 
There are buyers in plenty 
Who pass by that way. 
Little Basil and Amelie, 
Watching her, stand : 
Up to Mere Victorine 
Basil stretches his hand, 
Can't you spare me," says he, 
''A morsel of green, 
Or one sweet little flower, 
( )ood Mere Victorine ? " 
li If you come for a flower, 
Fray where is your sou / " 
Answers Mere Victorine, 
" I can't give one to you 
Such flowers as mine 
Are for selling, you know ; 
You must go to the country, 
\Yhere wild flowers grow."

A DAY AT VERSAILLES. 



AT Versailles, as perhaps you have heard, 
Countless pictures ot fights 
Form the chief of the sights: 
Could so many great battles have ever occurred? 






No wonder our children the gardens preferred : 
For the fountains were really so pretty a sight, 
That Bertie declared and I think he was right- 
It was better to play 
Like the fountains all day, 
Than such terrible battles to fight.

ROUND this pretty fountain here 
Sparrows gather all the year ; 
In its sparkling waters dip, 
From its basin freely sip, 
Round about their fountain play, 
Safe and happy all the day; 
Little "innocents" are they. 
That is Antoine, bread in hand ; 
See him by his mother stand : 
Saucy little birdies spy 
Antoine's bread, and at it fly, 
Trying each to get a share, 
Frightening little Antoine there. 
Antoine does not wish to share, 
Thinks the bread is all his right, 
Just to suit his appetite. 
Mother says, "Be kind, my son, 
There is more when this is done ; 
Bread enough for thee at home : 
Let the pretty sparrows come ; 
Give them each a little crumb." 

Here our little family 
Near the fountain too, we see, 
Walking through the open space 
To the covered market-place.

THE MARKETS OF 
-> PARISH- 




&<) 



HERE from morning till night they are selling and buying, 
And from morning till night their market wares crying: 

All around you will find there is food of each kind ; 

There are flesh, fowl, and fish here for every dish. 

The fish-market you see on the opposite page : 

On this stall that is nearest, the shell-fish appear ; 

But were I to begin, it would take me an age 

To tell you the names of the fish you find here. 

See! there's puss looking out for what she can get, 

And that little boy who is laughing is Paul, 

The girl with the lobster is sister Lisette, 

And he's watching to see if it nips her at all. 

Madame Blaise, there, tells Nellie her mussels are good, 

But Nellie smiles sweetly and goes on her way, 

And I venture to doubt if she quite understood 

All the funny French things Madame B!aise had to say. 

Other parts of the market contain butchers meat, 

And poultry, and fruit, and salads, and greens, 

And here, if you want them, quite young, fresh and sweet, 

Air the haricots verts which we know as "French beans." 

For, from morning till night here they re selling and buying, 
And from morning till night their market wares crying.

"HOSE and Bertie have a ride ; 
Mabel, walking at their side, 
Carries both the dolls, and so 
By the Luxembourg they go. 



IN THE 
LUXEMBOURG GARDENS. 



Over in that Palace soon Hear that woman, " Who will buy 

For the clock is marking noon Windmill, ball, or butterfly " 

The " Senate " will together come Josephine and Phillipe, see, 

( Like our " House of Lords " at home). Eager as they both can be. 

Charles before her, silent stands, 
With no money in his hands, 
No more sous he spent them all 
On that big inflated ball. 



Be content, my little friend, 
Money spent you cannot spend ; 
With your good St. Bernard play. 
Buy more toys another day.

IT ERE all the day long, 

Are race-horses for hire, 
That never go wrong. 
And besides, never tire. 
Here all the day long, 
Are race-horses for hire. 



Who will come for a ride ? 
Horses, lions, all ready ! 
Bear or tiger astride, 
You shall sit safe and steady. 
Who will come for a ride ? 
Lions, horses, all ready ! 




Round and round they canter slow soon they fast and faster go ; 
Look at Louis, all in white, Gaspard, almost out of sight, 
Rose and Mabel side by side ; Bertie watching while they ride. 
Dennis waits till they have done, much too big to join the fun ; 
Brother Paul, with serious air, minds his little sister Claire, 
Thinking if he had a sou, she should have some pleasure too.

NOW, with regret, they 've said Good-bye to Paris bright and gay ; 
To Calais they are drawing nigh you see them on their way. 
To travel thus, all through the night, at first they thought was fun. 
But by degrees they grew less bright, as hours passed one by one. 
Then Nellie to her sisters said, " Let 's have an extra rug, 
And make-believe we 're home in bed, and cuddle close and snug, 
And try, until the night has passed, which can most quiet keep." 
Then all were tucked up warm and fast, and soon fell sound asleep. 









The happy time abroad, again in dreams is all gone o'er 
Again in Paris, as it seems, they watch the crowd once more. 
The "Elysian Fields," beneath the trees, are peopled with a throng 
Of loveliest dolls, which at their ease converse, or ride along ; 
And wondrous "Easter Eggs" in nests, abundant lie around, 
And " April Fish " with golden vests and silver coats, abound ! 
Such fleeting fancies Dreamland lends to pass the time away 
Until the railway journey ends, just at the break of day. 



PORTE DE LA MER. CALAIS. 

r J^HE last place where they stopped abroad wns Calais, which, you know. 
* Belonged to England once though that was many a year ago : 
It has a beautiful old Tower, all weatherworn and brown, 
And here 's the Sea-Gate, opening from the walls that guard the town. 
But now Farewell to Merry France ! the vessel ready waits 
To take our party back again across the Dover Straits. 




HOMEWARD BOUND. 

HURRAH! we're afloat, and away speeds the boat as fast as its paddles can go, 
With the wind on its back, and a broad foaming track behind it, as white as the snow. 
On board, every eye is strained to descry the white cliffs of our own native land, 
And brightly they gleam, as onward we steam, till at length they are close at hand. 
The sun shines with glee on the rippling sea, and the pennant strung high on the mast. 
But at length it sinks down behind the grey town, and tells us the day is nigh past. 
See, there is the port, and near it a fort, and the strong old Castle of Dover 
We 're close to the shore just five minutes more, and the Channel Crossing is over. 
Then all safe and sound upon English ground, we bid farewell to the sea 
Jump into the train, and start off again as fast as the engine can flee. 
We run up to town, and thence travel down to the home in the country, at night ; 
Then. I 'm sorry to say, dear Nellie and May, Rose, Dennis, and Bertie bright, 
We must leave in their home till next holidays come, when, let all of us hope, it may chance 
That our trip will, next Spring, be as pleasant a thing as our swallow-flight over to France.

NOW THAT AT LAST WE'RE SAFELY BACK AGAIN. 
AND .AS UPON THE RAILWAY BRIDGE THE TRAIN 
IS STAYED SOME MOMENTS, LET US SAY GOOD-BYE. 
AND ASK IF YOU'VE ENJOYED THE TRIP. AND TRY 
To THINK THAT SOON AGAIN WE'RE SURE TO MEET, 
ON COUNTRY ROAD OR IN THE CROWDED STREET, 
AND ERE WE PART, STILL LINGER FOR A WHILE, 
VIEWING THIS TRANQUIL SCENE WITH PENSIVE SMILE,- 
TriE EVENING GLOW. THE RIVER'S FALLING TIDE, 
SAINT PAULS FAMILIAR DOME AND LONDON'S PRIDE.
